we have created you and made you one of mankind and one another and tribes nations in the other
indeed successful is the one who became pure
surely god knows all the thoughts within the breasts
the arabs of the desert say we believe
say do not believe rather you do not belong to god
if you obey god and his messenger he will not diminish you anything of your works
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
the believers are only those who fight in allahs cause and are not at all and their wealth and their lives in allah ’s way and his noble messenger and his noble messenger and then never are the people who stay in the cause of allah is the great
they are the truthful and sincere
say what would you teach god what your religion is and god knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth
they impress upon you that they have submitted
tell them do not favour me with your submission
in fact allah has favoured you with the truth so fear him if you are believers
verily god knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth
and god sees the things you do
qaf
qaf by oath of the glorious qur’an
rather they were shocked that a herald of warning came to them from among themselves so the disbelievers said “ this is something really strange ”
what when we are dead and become dust
that return is impossible ”
we know what the earth diminishes of them with us is a thing that we know
in fact they denied the truth when it came to them so they are now in a dilemma
have they not looked at the sky above them how we have fashioned and adorned it and it has no flaw
and we have spread out the earth how mountains as anchors in it and have grown all kinds of beautiful pairs in it
as instruction and reminder to every penitent creature
and we sent down water from the sky and grow gardens with it and caused springs to grow grain for harvest
and tall palmtrees with spathes compact
and tall datepalms with their spathes pile on pile
even thus will be the life after death
the people of noah arrass and thamud denied before you
the tribe of a’ad and firaun and the fellowmen of lut
the people of the woods denied the noble messengers so my promised them and my people of knowledge was one of them
did we not create the first time
nay but they are in doubt playing
and indeed we created man and we know what he has no power over him and we do not see what we do
when the two angels meet together sitting one on the right and one on the left
there is not a word he utters but an observer is ready to make note of it
and deaths agony comes in truth that is what you were promised
and the trumpet shall be blown then behold the angels will come down
that day will be the day of doom
every soul shall come and every soul shall come with it
you had tried your eyesight even though are in the sight
his companion will say here is the record i have ready with me
cast each stubborn unbeliever into hell they will be told
every hinderer of the good transgressor disquieter
cast him into the twain into gehenna to gehenna every froward unbeliever
his companion will say o lord i did not lead him to wickedness but he was himself far astray
he shall say dispute not before me
“ with me the decree does not change and nor do i oppress the bondmen ”
the day when we will ask hell “ are you filled up ” and it will answer “ are there some more ”
and paradise will be brought near not far from those who took heed for themselves and feared god
this is the expiation for an eye
who feared arrahman in secret and came with a penitent heart
enter it in peace
this is the day of eternity
in it for them is all that they may desire and with us is more than it
how many a generation we destroyed before them – thereupon they cried out whereas it is not the return to them
surely in that is a reminder to him who has a heart or will heart
and we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and no weariness came upon us
so you bear with patience what they say and sing the praises of your lord before the rising of the sun and its setting
and proclaim his purity during the night and at the ends of the prostrations
and listen thou for the day when the caller shall call from a near place
the day they actually hear the blast will be the day of rising of the dead
this is the day they shall come out of the graves
indeed it is we who give life and give death and towards us only is the return
the day when they will come out of their graves in all haste this is the gathering ahead of them and a clear place
we know very well what they say thou art not a tyrant over them
so remind them if reminder is profitable
by the swift scatterers
and we loose the rain upon it stones from the cloud gathering
and those who move on the water gently
and those that outstrip suddenly
surely that you are promised is true
and undoubtedly justice will surely be done
and the heaven which contains the constellations
you are indeed in different opinions regarding this qur’an
only those who are destined to revert are reverted from it
perish the conjecturers
who are dazed in perplexity
they ask when is the day of judgement
upon the day when they shall be tried at the fire
so now taste the punishment the result of your disbelief ”
this is what you were trying to hasten
indeed the pious are amidst gardens and springs
receiving what is given them by their lord
they were surely the virtuous before this
they slept little in the night
and every morning asked forgiveness
and the beggar and the destitute had a share in their wealth
in the earth are signs for those who are certain
and within yourselves
and in the heaven lies your sustenance and the promise you are given
and in the heaven lies your sustenance and the promise you are given
so by oath of the lord of the heavens and the earth this qur’an is the truth in the same language that you speak
did the news of ibrahim ’s honourable guests reach you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
when they entered unto him saying peace he said peace
then he went to his home – so he brought a healthy calf
and placing it before them said wo nt you eat
and he conceived a fear of them
they said be not afraid they gave him good tidings of a cunning boy
then came forward his wife clamouring and she smote her face and said an old woman barren
they said “ indeed your lord only he is the wise the all knowing ”
said he and thy people thee the angels see thee not
they said “ we have been sent towards a guilty nation ”
to loose upon them stones of clay
impressed with the signs of your lord
so we evacuated everyone who was a believer there
but we found not therein except as they are believers
and we kept a sign remaining in it for those who fear the painful punishment
and also in moses when we sent him unto a clear authority
in response he turned away along with his army and said “ he is a magician or a madman ”
so we seized him and his hordes and threw them into the sea
and also in ad when he is a sign unto all beings
and turned everything it touched to ashes
and in thamud when we said to them enjoy yourselves for a while
and the cry seized them justly towards their lord
and they were not able to stand upright and were not helped
before them they were surely a people of nooh
and heaven we built it with might and we extend it wide
and we made the earth a base so how well do we lay out
and of everything created we two kinds haply you will remember
so take to yourselves gods
i am a clear warner from him to you
do not set up another god with god
i am indeed a clear warner from him
even thus no apostle came to those before them but they said he is a sorcerer or a mad man
what have they willed this utterance to one another
nay but they are an insolent people
so turn thou from them thou wilt not be reproached
and remind the reminder profits the believers
i have not created jinn and mankind except to serve me
i desire of them no provision neither do i desire that they should feed me
indeed allah is the greatest sustainer the strong the able
those who are evildoers there awaits them a chastisement like theirs shall be a portion of it
alas the woe for unbelievers for that day which they are promised
i call to witness the mount sinai
and the scripture inscribed
and the scripture inscribed
and the house inhabited house for those that are needy folk
and the lofty roof
and the sea swarming
indeed the punishment of your lord is to be feared
he could take care of him
the day the sky becomes like molten brass
and the mountains are in motion
ruin is for the deniers on that day
those who are playing in pursuits
the day they are dragged and pushed into hell
this is the fire that you cried lies to
is this magic or are you the sense
roast in it bear it with patience or impatience it will be the same for you
you will be requited for what you had done
indeed the pious are amidst gardens and springs
rejoicing in that their lord has given them
eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you were working
reclining on thrones in rows and we have wedded them to maidens with gorgeous eyes
and those who accepted faith and whose descendants followed them with faith – we have joined their descendants with them and made their people as partners become very proud
every soul is pledged to what it does
and we aided them with fruit and meat whatever they desire
in it they accept cups from each other in which is neither any lewdness nor any sin
and their boy servants shall go around them as if they were pearls safely hidden
and one of them turned towards the other questioning
saying we were before in already there was also in our presence
and god was gracious to us and guarded us against the chastisement of the burning wind
we had tried him before this
he is the benevolent evermerciful
therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him enlighten for by the munificence of your lord you are neither a soothsayer nor a madman
or do they say he is a poet for whom we await fates uncertainty
say then wait i am waiting with you
or do their intellects bid them do this or are they an insolent people
or do they say he has forged it
nay but they do not believe
so let them bring a discourse like it if they are truthful
or were they created out of nothing
or did they create the heavens and earth
nay but they have not sure faith
or are thy lords treasuries in their keeping
or are they the treasurers
or have you any authority upon the heavens constellations of stars and a clear proof
let one who has heard then bring a clear proof
or has he daughters and they sons
or askest thou them for a wage and so they are weighed down with debt
or do they have knowledge of the unknown which they copy down
or do they have any stairs climbing upon which allah will not finish
the unbelievers they are the outwitted
or do they have a god besides allah
glory be to god above that they associate
and were they to see a portion of the sky falling they will say “ it is a heap of clouds ”
so leave them until they confront their day in which they will be stunned
the day their guile shall avail them naught and they shall not be helped
and indeed for the unjust is another punishment before this but most of them do not know
and be patient upon your lord ’s command
and proclaim the praise of thy lord when thou arisest
and proclaim the praise of thy lord when thou arisest
i call to witness the star of the pleiades when it has dipped
your companion did not err nor did he go astray
neither does he speak of his own will
nun
taught him by one terrible in power
he is allpowerful and allmighty
and he was on the horizon of the highest heaven
then the spectacle became closer and came down in full view
until the space of two bow arcs or even less remained
then revealed to his servant that he revealed
his heart did not falsify what he perceived
so do you dispute with him regarding what he saw him
he saw him indeed another time
by the lotetree beyond which none can pass
close to which is the everlasting paradise
the day when the great calamity befalls and they will be offered by obeying the noble messengers
the sight did not shift nor did it cross the limits
indeed he saw the supreme signs of his lord
just ponder over what you sow
and manat the third the other
what for you the son and for him the daughter
then that is surely a very unjust distribution
they are naught but names yourselves have named and your fathers god has sent down no authority touching them they are only conjecturing
can ever man get what he desires
and to us belong the end and the beginning god is aware of the things you do
how many is in the heavens and the earth that which none is in the least save for him whom allah gives leave and his companions whom he willed and did not leave would offer their excuses
those who do not believe in the hereafter coin the names of females
they do not know its truth at all they only make guesses
therefore turn away from whoever has turned away from our remembrance and has desired only the life of this world
this is their attainment of knowledge
your lord surely knows those who have strayed from his path and knows those who are rightly guided
to god belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and that he may recompense those who do evil for what they have done good
and those who avoid the heinous sins and indecencies and when they are angry forgive
surely thy lord is allclement allcompassionate
he created you from clay and then he brings you forth from the mothers wombs things you have made you as well as he produced you from the mothers ’ wombs whilst you do not know
he is cognisant of what you do
hast thou considered him who turns his back
and gives a little and then grudgingly
does he possess the knowledge of the unseen and therefore he sees
or did not the news reach him in which is mentioned in the books of moosa
and indeed ibrahim is from his nooh ’s group
that no soul laden bears the load of another
that a man receives but only that for which is given
and that his effort will soon be scrutinised
then he shall be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense
and that the end is only towards your lord
and that it is he who makes to laugh and that makes to weep
and that he who ordains death
that he has created the two kinds of two pairs
and that it is he who has destroyed the tribe of aad
and that upon him rests the second growth
and who ordains death
and proclaim the purity of allah – indeed he only is the lord of the creation ”
and thamood the people of ad
thamood
and before them the people of nooh indeed they did exceeding evil and were more unjust than they
and the subverted city he also overthrew
so that they were covered over by what they were covered over
how many favours of your lord will you then deny
he who warns you is one of the warners of old
the approaching event has come near
none except allah can avert it
are you astonished at this news
and do you laugh and do you not weep
indulging in pleasantries
bow instead in adoration before god and worship him
the hour has come and split is the moon
and when they see a sign they turn away and say “ just a customary magic ”
and deny and follow their own vain desires
and the second creation is incumbent on him
and indeed the news which had a lot of deterrence came to them
containing consummate wisdom yet warnings were of no avail
so turn away from them
on the day when the crier calls to the painful business
abasing their eyes they shall come forth from the tombs as if they were scattered grasshoppers
they shall say this is the day when they shall be veiled from them that is a day
the people of noah cried lies before them they cried lies to our servant and said a man possessed
so he prayed to his lord i am helpless deliver me
we opened the gates of heaven water in torrents
and caused springs to gush out from the earth so that the two waters met totalling a quantity that had been destined
and carried nooh upon a ship of wooden planks and nails
sailing in front of our sight as a reward for the sake of one who was rejected
and we left it as a sign – so is there one who would ponder
how was then my punishment and my commination
easy have we made the quran to understand so is there any one who will be warned
the tribe of a’ad denied – so how did my punishment turn out and my warnings
we loosed against them a wind clamorous in a day of ill fortune continuous
smashing down men as if they were uprooted trunks of date palms
how was then my punishment and my commination
easy have we made the quran to understand so is there any one who will be warned
thamood cried lies to the warnings
and said should we follow only one man among us
they said “ yes indeed we are in error and insanity ”
was he the one of all of us to have been given the exposition
nay rather he is an impudent liar
they will come to know soon
we shall send the shecamel to try them
and say to each one of them belongs that the waters of every community and for each community it is a day that each of them is between them
but they called their commander who seized and hamstrung her
how was then my punishment and my commination
we sent a single blast against them and they were reduced to husks of a decayed fence
easy have we made the quran to understand so is there any one who will be warned
the people of lot cried lies to the envoys
we sent a stonehurtling storm against them except the family of lot whom we saved in the early hours of the morning
as a favour from us
that is how we reward the grateful
and indeed the tribe of a’ad denied them – so they were unable to lay a time on the day of resurrection
and they tried to persuade him regarding his guests – we therefore blinded their eyes “ so taste my punishment and my warnings ”
and the everlasting punishment overtook them
“ so taste my punishment and my warnings ”
easy have we made the quran to understand so is there any one who will be warned
the warnings came also to pharaohs folk
they rejected each one of them denied the signs of their lord so we seized them with the seizing of one mighty omnipotent
are your disbelievers better than they were or have you been given exemption in the books
or do they say we are a congregation that shall be succoured
the group will soon be routed and will turn their backs to flee
nay but their hour is greater and they shall not be questioned concerning their own promise
surely the sinners are misguided and insane
on the day when they are dragged upon their faces in the fire taste now the touch of sakar
we have indeed created all things by measure
and our command is but one word swift as the winking of an eye
we have destroyed the cities of you and we destroyed the transgressors
all things they do are recorded in the books
and every small and great thing is recorded
surely the godfearing shall dwell amid gardens and a river
at the still centre in the proximity of the king allpowerful
the allmerciful
and remember the name of his lord
created man
and taught him to express clearly
the sun and moon revolve to a computation
and the grasses and the trees bow to him in adoration
and allah has raised the sky and he has set the balance
transgress not in the balance
and establish the measures justly nor decrease the due weight
and earth he set it down for all beings
therein fruits and palmtrees with sheaths
and grain in the blade and fragrant herbs
how many favours of your lord will then both of you deny
he created man of a clay like the potters
and created jinn from the flame of fire
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
lord of the two easts lord of the two wests
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
he has set two seas in motion that flow side by side together
whereas there is a barrier between them so they can not encroach upon one another
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
pearls and coralstone come forth from them
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
and the ships run on the sea like hills
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
all that is on the earth is passing
and everlasting is the entity of your lord the most majestic and the most honourable
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
all those who are in the heavens and the earth will come to the most gracious as his bondmen
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
o two groups of jinns you will be just even if you can understand
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
o society of jinns and men cross the bounds of the heavens and the earth if you have the ability then pass beyond them
he is no helpers
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
flames of smokeless fire and black smoke without flames will be let loose on you so you will not be able to retaliate
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
when the sky will split asunder and turn rosy like the dregs of annointing oil
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
neither man nor jinn will be questioned on that day about his sin
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
the sinners shall be known by their mark and they shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
this is hell which the criminals deny
they shall keep going back and forth between it and the extremely hot boiling water
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
and give him good tidings of his lord for them are two gardens
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
full of overhanging branches
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
in which are two gardens flow two springs
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
in which are fruits of all kinds each of two varieties
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
reclining upon green cushions and lovely druggets
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
in them maidens with averted glances undeflowered by man or by jinn before them
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
they are like rubies and coralstone
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
what is the reward of virtue except virtue in return
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
and besides these two other gardens
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
and those that draw out violently
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
in the gardens are two springs overflowing with abundance
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
in them are fruits of all kinds and dates and pomegranate
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
in them are women of good behaviour and gorgeous faces
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
houris cloistered in pavilions
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
untouched before them by any man or jinn
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
reclining on green cushions and beautiful decorated carpets
so o men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
most auspicious is the name of your lord the most majestic and the most honourable
when the forthcoming event does occur
then none will be able to deny its occurrence
abasing exalting
when the earth will tremble shivering
and the mountains will move with a visible movement
so they will become like fine dust scattered in a shaft of light
and you will become divided into three categories
the companions of the right o companions of the right
and those on the left – how wretched are those on the left
and those that outstrip suddenly
they are the inheritors
in the gardens of bliss
and a few of later ages
and a few of later ages
on couches wrought of gold
on couches wrought of gold
immortal youths going round about them
cups and decanters beakers full of sparkling wine
unheady uninebriating
and fruits that they may like
and such flesh of fowl as they desire
and gorgeous eyed fair maidens
like pearls safely hidden
as recompense for all they had done
therein they shall hear no idle talk no cause of sin
except the saying “ peace ”
the companions of the right o companions of the right
among thornless lotetrees
and acacia covered with heaps of bloom
and in everlasting shade
gushing water
and such fruits as they desire
and the distress
and raised couches
we have formed them in a distinctive fashion
and made them virginal
loving companions matched in age
for those of the right hand
and a throng of the later folk
a large group from the earlier generations
and those on the left – how wretched are those on the left
in scorching wind and boiling hot water
in scorching wind and boiling hot water
neither cool nor agreeable
indeed they were among favours before this
and those who unnecessarily harass muslim
they said what when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we indeed be raised up
and our fathers too
say indeed the earlier and the later generations
they shall all be gathered together on a certain day
then indeed you the astray the deniers –
will eat of the tree of zaqqum
fill your bellies with it
and drink over it scalding water
drinking the way thirsty camels drink
this is their reception on the day of justice
it is we who created you so why do you not accept the truth
do you yourselves create it or are we the creators
do you yourselves create it or are we the creators
it is we who have ordained death among you and we have not been beaten –
in fact we have caused you to harm others ”
you have known the first creation then why do you not reflect
do you yourselves sow it or are we the sowers
do you give it its increase or are we the giver
if we will we can make it like dry trampled hay so you would keep crying out
and they say “ o our misfortune ”
nay rather we have been robbed
do you send it down from the clouds or we send it down
do you send it down from the clouds or we send it down
if we will we can make it bitter so why do you not give thanks
do you yourselves sow it or are we the sowers
is it you who grew its tree or is it we who create
we have made it as a reminder and convenience for the needy
therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him proclaim the purity of the name of your lord the greatest
so i call the placement of the stars to witness
and that is indeed a tremendous oath if you understand
commemorate the speech of a man
inscribed in the wellkept book
none may touch it except with ablution
a sending down from the lord of all being
so do you hold this discourse in disdain
and you make its denial your share
then how is it that when the dying breath is withdrawn into the throat and rattles
and you wait for the moment of death
and we are nearer to him than you are but you can not see
then why if you are not indebted to us for life
do you not bring him back answer if you speak truly
if he is one of the close the honoured
there shall be peace and plenty and gardens of tranquility for him
if he is of those of the right hand
there will be the salutation by those of the right hand peace on you
if he is of those who have been astray from the right hand
then his reception is the hot boiling water
and will go into the blazing fire
this is indeed the ultimate truth
therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him proclaim the purity of the name of your lord the greatest
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god he is the allmighty the allwise
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
so that he punishes and is powerful over everything
he is allknowing and allpowerful
the one who created the heavens and the earth in six days then befitting his majesty established himself over the throne
he knows what penetrates into the earth and what comes forth from it what comes down from heaven and what goes up unto it
and god sees the things you do
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
but all things rest with god in the end
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and he knows what lies within the hearts
believe in god and his apostle and spend of what he has given you
those of you who believe and spend in the way of god are a great reward
and allah gave you the knowledge of the two muslims in fact he has promised you if you believe and fulfil your promise before your lord if you have faith
stand firm we have sent down upon your servant signs clear signs and he sends down upon the light
god is merciful to you
what has come upon you that you do not spend in the way of god and your wealth are a few of you
there is no way of reproach and those who spent and who fought before the victory
they are higher in position than those who spent after the victory and fought
but god has already forgiven what you make a promise made to grow before you and made to those who are righteous
god is aware of the things you do
who will lend a handsome loan to allah so that he may double it for him and for such is an honourable reward
and on the day when you see the believing men and believing women that their right hands on their right – and on the right of honour they will love and good deeds for you
this will be the great achievement of success
the day when hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to the muslims “ look mercifully towards us ” – so think they are on the hypocrites ”
it shall be said return you back behind and seek for a light
there is a wall before it and a door in which they both a door in the inward he is a benevolence and illuminating
the hypocrites will say “ were we not with you ”
but you yourselves were also asked about gods and you used to come back to grief which of you were at variance
when the command of allah comes
so no ransom will be accepted of you on that day or of those who refused to believe
your abode is hell that you were doing
how evil a destination
god decides with justice and the believers
most of them are averse and do not understand
know that god enlivens the earth even after it has died
so we distinguish the signs for you haply you will understand
surely the men and women are righteous and the believers men and the good deeds shall be recompensed for them with the mighty wage
those who believe in god and his messengers are considered testifiers of the truth
they have their guerdon and their light
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell
know that the present life is but a sport and a diversion an adornment and a cause for boasting among you and a rivalry in wealth and children
you should see how they hesitate and turn away
the present life is but a sport and a roaring furnace
rush towards forgiveness from your lord and a paradise wide as a flow that is made for those who believe and remain in it forever allah and his promise is true
this is the bounty of god he gives whosoever he please
there is no misfortune that reaches in the earth or in your selves but is mentioned in a book before we initiate it indeed this is easy for allah
lest you grieve for what you missed or rejoice at what you received
god does not love the egoist and the braggart
who hold back what they possess and enjoin stinginess on others
whosoever turns away from god should remember that god is selfsufficient worthy of praise
we have indeed sent down the book with the truth and the balance so that people may judge between men and the book and the balance may make it clear to mankind
and we cut off the great deal with them and might know that we might have appointed enemies as a trial and the believers and the believers and the hypocrites are in authority
verily god is powerful and allmighty
we had given the book and the prophets and the seed of the book and the wisdom and the prophethood and the book and the most men are transgressors
then we sent among them warners
then we made the others the later folk who followed him in distress
but they did not wish to be wronged themselves but it was made to them they only themselves and they were wronged
so when the believers come to fight they are believers most of them are ungodly
o believers fear god and believe in him and struggle in the way of god he will give you twice as much of his bounty and will give you twice to please for god is forgiving and kind
this is the bounty of god he gives whosoever he please and limits them for his bounty is infinite
god has indeed heard the speech of the woman who argued with you about her husband and makes complaint unto god
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
those of you who divorce your wives by calling them mothers can not make them their mothers
their mothers are only those who gave birth to them
they are not worthy of being called upon falsehood
god is allforgiving and merciful
those who call their wives their mothers then revoke what they had said should free a slave before having physical contact with them
this is what we desire to give you
but he who can not find the means to fast for two successive months before the two of them touch one another and one of them who was not able to fast must then feed sixty needy persons who are subdued and transgress
this is the truth in order that you may not believe in allah and his noble messenger and the truthful
and for the disbelievers there is painful punishment
indeed those who oppose allah and his noble messenger have been humiliated like those before them who were humiliated and they were humiliated like those before them
we have sent down very clear signs
the punishment for disbelievers is ignominious
on the day when god will raise them up together he will tell them of what they did
he has counted them and calculated their number
have you not considered that god knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
wherever they are secret and the secrets of your hearts may come and they can not find much as the weight of an ant and if they are able to escape from them they will not be able to escape
and on the day of judgement he will announce their deeds to them
god has knowledge of everything
did you not see those who were forbidden from conspiracy yet they do what was forbidden and consult each other for sinning and for exceeding limits and for disobeying the noble messenger
and when they come to you they greet you with a greeting even god said to us or we desire the messenger to come to you with a man or god will bring us back to us
how evil a destination
o believers when you conspire secretly then conspire secretly together in sin and enmity and disobedience to the messenger but conspire in piety and godfearing fear god unto him fear him you have to gather
the devil only seeks to instil hatred and to the muslims but it is only satan promises and he promises them from his lord – so the believers and only upon the muslims must not harm them except a few
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
o believers when you are told expend god has made to you and to make room in the assemblies then make room god will give you more room for you
when you are told to rise then rise god will raise those of you who believe and those who have knowledge of you who have gathered
god is aware of the things you do
o believers when you conspire with the messenger before your conspiring advance a freewill offering that is better for you and purer
this is better for you and becoming
and if you do not find the means then surely god is forgiving and kind
are you afraid of giving alms before confering
if you repent you can offer prayers for a few and perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey god and his messenger
god is aware of the things you do
did you not see those who befriended those upon whom is allah ’s wrath
they belong neither to you nor to them and swear in the breasts of you are not of them
god has prepared for them severe punishment
evil are the acts they commit
they have taken their oaths as a covering then they have barred from the way of god for them awaits a mighty chastisement
neither their riches nor children will avail them against god
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
on the day when allah will raise them together they will swear before you and swear before you and they swear on the day that they will swear to allah and they will swear to you that they are on something like you and they recognise their speech
is it not they who are liars
satan has got the better of them and made them forget to remember them and their number none but satan caused them to forget to mention satan to their deeds
they are the satans doing satan
indeed it is the devil ’s group who are the losers
surely those who oppose god and his messenger those are among the most abject
god has chosen submission to me that i am one of the other
verily god is powerful and allmighty
you will not find any way who believe in god and the last day befriending those who oppose god and his messenger even though they are their fathers or their brothers or their brothers or their brothers
they were not idolaters and their messenger and god has forbidden them from his right hand or with them
and admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever gods that is the greatest success
god has inscribed on their hearts and they will be gratified in obeying him
surely the godfearing shall not prosper
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god he is the allmighty the allwise
those who disbelieve were given the book were idolaters and whom we had been sent with the book would not have associated with god and not with them any host but god will turn their backs and my word into the vilest state of doom
had god not been gracious to them he would have punished them in this world and in the next the punishment of the hereafter
this was so because they had made a promise made to god and his apostle
whoso does evil shall be smitten by god he is indeed powerful severe
the trees you had cut down or left standing on their roots was all by allah ’s permission and in order to disgrace the sinners indeed allah ’s punishment is supreme supreme
god sent down his apostle from the skies though you were averse to his apostle and god has power over everything you did not know
god has struck a similitude the people of the cities belongs to the families of the tribes that the day of the two men possessed of the eyes and the poor observe your families and the orphans till the needy the traveller and those who are engaged in the
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him what is the matter with you and fear allah and heed attentively and keep fearing allah
surely god is powerful unrelenting in retribution
god pardon the best of the spoils to please god and his messenger and the light are the truthful
those who came to them who were arrogant towards their homes and became good tidings of a present life and made them a generation who accepted faith and feared that they had no fear of allah
and whoso is guarded against the avarice of his own soul those they are the prosperers
and those who came after them who say o lord give us our sins and forgive us our sins and our sins are the losers ”
the hypocrites are certainly disbelievers among the people given the books who do not believe in you – and if you are fought against we will never help you with another and if any victory comes to you we will never rescue moosa and your trust with you
and god bears witness that they are truly liars
if they are driven out they will not go with them and if they are attacked they will not aid them and if they aided them they will get their faces with them surely god is with the pious
and if the hypocrites are in a few they will not be helped
their hearts are filled with remorse and fear god
that is because they have no sense
they will not fight you in the body except in fortified cities or from behind you
their enmity among themselves is great
you think they are united but divided are their hearts
that is because these people are devoid of sense
those before them who were also accused the messengers of lies before them there awaits them a painful chastisement
the example of the devil is like that of adam
he said “ we disbelieve in hell – a day then a further time ”
he will say “ i fear allah the lord of the creation ”
then both the end of them were in the past
this is the punishment for the wicked
o you who believe be fearful of god
let each soul consider what it has forwarded for the morrow and fear god
god is aware of the things you do
and be not like those who forgot the fish and it themselves they are the people who have forgotten it
they are the reprobates
not equal are the inhabitants of the fire and the inhabitants of the fire
the people of paradise will be felicitous
if we had sent down a mountain that could have seen it possibly you would have seen it bowed before me
we offer these examples to men that they may think and reflect
he is the knower of the unseen and the visible the most merciful the most merciful
he is allmerciful allforgiving
there is no god but he the one the omnipotent
glory be to god above that they associate
he is the creator the maker the heavens and the earth
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
he is allpowerful and allmighty
o my people do not take my enemies as your friends instead of them do not believe in what has come to you
and when we took compact with you and did not drive you out of your eyes swerved you already believed we did not send down with our signs except that we willed you would not have given you
and what you know and what you publish
whoever of you does this will have gone astray from the right path
if they gain dominance over you they will be your enemies and will extend their hands and their tongues towards you with evil and they wish that in some way you turn disbelievers
neither your blood relations nor your offspring will be of any avail to you on the day of resurrection
and god sees the things you do
and indeed in ibrahim are those whom we had rescued him and said “ indeed in the book and the prophets – there is a good example in worship – if you yourselves do not believe in him and you yourselves have any control over all things ”
our lord make us not an example of punishment for thou art the allmighty the allwise
you have had a good example in them for whoever hopes for god and the last day and remembers god oft
whosoever turns away from god should remember that god is selfsufficient worthy of praise
it maybe that god will create love between you and your enemies
god is severe in punishment
god forbids you not as regards those who did not have fought you from religions cause nor expelled you from your habitations that you would not have been killed
verily god loves those who are just
god forbids you not as regards those who have fought you in religions cause and expelled you from your habitations and take you to yourselves
and whosoever takes them for friends those they are the evildoers
o believers when believing women come to you as emigrants test them
god alone is cognisant of their faith
if you find that they are believers do not send them back to unbelievers after they have spent on them
there is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them
there is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them
they are wellpleased to be then ask leave of thee the unbelievers the return of what they have spent on you
this is god your lord judge between you and
god is allknowing and allwise
if one of you deliver the unbelievers after the other chastise then if they are angry then after having given them the unbelievers should give them their wages honourably
and fear god in whom you believe
o prophet why should you take their children out of old against the idolaters take their covenant and families from god so that you should not find any way against them neither will they carry their loads nor disobey thee and god is allpardoning allforgiving
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o you who believe do not make friends with those whom god has favoured among you
the unbelievers have lost hope of the life to come have been made to look attractive seem good to them
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
o you who believe wherefore do you say what you do not
how despicable it is in the sight of allah that you may preach what you do not practice
god loves those who fight in his way in ranks as though they were a building wellcompacted
and moses said to his people o my people why do you afflict me though you know that i have been sent to you by god
when they swerved god caused their hearts to swerve and god encompasses the things they do
god does not show an unjust people the way
and remember when eisa the son of maryam said “ o descendants of israel
so when jesus perceived their unbelief they said this is only magic
and who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against allah whereas he is being called towards islam
god does not show an unjust people the way
they wish to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths whereas allah will perfect his light even if the disbelievers get annoyed
it is he who has sent his noble messenger with guidance and the religion of truth in order to make it prevail over all other religions and allah is sufficient as a witness
o you who believe may i offer you a bargain which will save you from a painful punishment
o believers come to believe in god and his messenger and struggle in the way of god with your possessions and your selves
this is better for you if you understand
he will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow and excellent mansions in the garden of eden
this will be the great achievement of success
and he will give you another favour which is dear to you – the help from allah and an imminent victory and the pious
and when god said to the prophet jesus son of mary be to the disciples “ who will out the aides of allah ’s religion ” say “ who will help us against allah if allah had accepted faith the believers ”
and a party of the children of israel believed and a party disbelieved
so we helped those who believed against their enemies and they prevailed over them
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him he is the allmighty the allwise
it is he who has sent among the unlettered people a noble messenger from themselves who recites his verses to them and purifies them and bestows them the knowledge of the book and wisdom and indeed before them is the almighty the wise
and others of them who have not yet joined them yet god is allmighty allwise
this is the bounty of god which he bestows on whosoever he please and the bounty of him
the likeness of those who have been loaded with the torah then they have not carried it is as the likeness of an ass carrying books
how wretched the semblance of the people who deny the words of god
god does not show an unjust people the way
say o you jews if you claim that you are the favourites of god apart from all men then wish for death if you speak the truth
but they will never wish for death because of what they had done
but god knows who are the wicked
say surely death from which you run will surely come to you
you will then be sent back to him who knows the unknown and the known who will tell you what you used to do
o believers when proclamation is made for prayer on the day of congregation hasten to gods remembrance and leave trafficking aside
this is better for you if you understand
and when the prayer ends spread out in the land and seek allah ’s munificence and profusely remember allah upon the hope of attaining success
and when they see a group one another or a group among them is a group that invites you or desires to take you away from it and has a better place to escape
when the hypocrites come to you they say we affirm that you are the apostle of god and assuredly we were witness
god bears witness that the messenger and the hypocrites are indeed liars
they have made their oaths a shield and obstruct people from the way of god
evil are the acts they commit
that is because they have believed and then they have been sealed so their hearts are covered with terror
when you look at them and their ears and eyes and persons are needs to observe their moral obligations
and they said “ we agree ” so they do not accept faith in it and whoever does not have the right hand – the reward of allah and his noble messengers was fulfilled for them
god assail them
death seize him how he determined
and when it is said to them come now to the messenger of god you will turn back to you but you will turn away before them turning their faces away with pride
whether you plead forgiveness for them or do not warn them god will never forgive them
god does not show an unjust people the way
they are the ones who say do not spend on those who are with the apostle of god till they break away from him
but they are not within the treasures of the heavens and the earth but god knows the hypocrites do not understand
they say “ go to the city o muslims we shall return to the town certainly the more strong and the spectacle which is the best ”
but power belongs to god his apostle and the hypocrites do not know
o you who believe do not take you to wealth and children cause you to neglect your wealth and children
whosoever does evil shall be the losers
and spend from what we have provided you before death approaches any one of you and he then said “ o my lord why did you not give me respite for a while that i may be among the believers ”
god does not burden a soul beyond capacity
god is aware of the things you do
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
all praise be to god who has the power over everything and he is the allmighty the allwise
it is he who created you one of you a believer like one of you is a believer and one of you is a believer
and god sees the things you do
he created the heavens and the earth with deliberation and gave you form and shaped you well and to him is your returning
he knows all that is in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you publish
god knows the thoughts within the breasts
did not the news of those who disbelieved before you reach you
for them there is painful punishment
this is because their noble messengers used to bring clear proofs to them in response they said “ what ” say “ allah has guided us ” and they are servile
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
the unbelievers claim that they will not be raised again
say yes by my lord you will be raised again and then informed of your deeds
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
so believe in god and his messenger and the prophet if you believe
god is aware of the things you do
the day he will gather you together on the day of gathering will be the day of judgement
god has made it leaders who believe and do righteous deeds that he will admit him into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever god loves those who believe and do righteous deeds
this will be the great achievement of success
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell where they will remain for ever
and no sign came to them except by allah he guides whomever he wills and allah guides whomever he wills so the most people do not believe
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
god has knowledge of everything
and obey allah and obey the noble messenger but if you turn away know that the duty upon our noble messenger is only to plainly convey
god there is no god but he
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
o believers some of your spouses and children are your enemies so beware of them for you if you believe in the support of your wives and fear god surely god is allforgiving allcompassionate
your wealth and your children are only a trial and with god is a mighty wage
so fear god as much as you can and listen and obey and spend in charity for your own good
whoso is guarded against the avarice of his own soul those they are the prosperers
if you lend to women a goodly loan he will multiply it for you and will forgive you
god is allthankful allclement
the all knowing of all things hidden and visible – he knows the all knowing of everything
divorce them when they have reached their wives and fear allah your lord
do not exceed the bounds of your lord and do not keep your wives honourably or your lord have given them except those who are lost in marriage till they come near to them
these are the limits set by god
whosoever transgresses the bounds of god four months believes in god and his messengers will surely find in his way
you never know that god may perchance lead to a new situation after this
and when they have reached their term retain them honourably or part from the houses other days in time then when they have passed away before allah he appointed for you a complete injustice to him and seek forgiveness for them
and call in to witness two men among you witnesses and do not consider it bad as are witnesses
god is witness to him who believes in god and the last day and struggles in the world to come
god will furnish a way out for him who fears him
and he will provide for him from whence he never reckoned
god is sufficient for him who places his trust in him
surely god attains his purpose
god has indeed fixed a measure of everything
o believers if you divorce your wives have reached your term then you have no hope of menstruation and in case you have a doubt concerning their time for them so they have not menstruated yet
and those who are with child their term is when they bring forth their burden
god will furnish a way out for him who fears him
this is the decree of god who knows all and is told gods displeasure of god who will acquit him of his evil deeds and is great reward
lodge them where you are lodging according to your means and do not press them so as to straiten their circumstances
if they are pregnant then spend on them until they give birth to the child expend of what they give birth to the child
and if they suckle the child for them then let them put their trust in them until they leave the child for the child
let him expend of that we have provided means of ease and for him whose provision is stinted to him let him expend of what we have given him
god does not burden a soul beyond capacity
god will bring ease after hardship
as for ad they turned in disdain from their lord and his messengers and we destroyed them with a terrible chastisement
like one who has been tasted the mischief of their action and is a grievous sin
god has prepared for them severe punishment and hasten to give them the good tidings of a shameful punishment
god has indeed sent down a reminder for you
indeed we have sent down towards you a noble messenger of allah to warn you of the leader who accept the clear verses and you from the realms of darkness into light and the disbelievers are the light of allah
god has made it sons for those who believe and do righteous deeds that he will admit him into gardens underneath which rivers flow and they will abide for ever
god has made for him a goodly provision
‘ and it is allah who created the seven heavens atop each other ’
and the decree of god and the other cut off and say the command of allah will bring all things to you but do you not know
o prophet forbid yourself what has happened to you that you may ask for yourself what is in your hearts
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god has ordained for you the absolution of your oaths
he is indeed allknowing and allwise
when the prophet told one of your wives be as he asked him
when however he informed her about it she asked about it and said who told you this is the allknowing allinformed
if you both repent and reform god is his protector and gabriel and the righteous supporters are the believers and the polytheist men of polytheist women – they have not taken him as his protector and if they have supporters
if he divorces you his lord will give him to women in return and be better than you in your place widows and maidens who are obedient believing respectful penitent serving
o you who believe save yourselves and your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for the evildoers of which are the extremely strict angels who disobey not refuse the command of punishment
and the disbelievers said “ o disbelievers
do not feign excuses this day you will only be repaid what you used to do ”
o you who believe turn to god truly in repentance
it may your lord will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and excellent a way he has made you gardens of everlasting stay
and their light will be only upon them from their right hands and their light in which they will say o lord perfect our light
perfect our light for us and forgive us indeed you are able to do all things ”
o prophet struggle with the unbelievers and hypocrites and be thou harsh with them their refuge is gehenna an evil homecoming
and the disbelievers said “ allah has given the wife of lut – if the wife of lut they will get her equal to the one of the other – and they will stay away from among them ”
and they were married women besides these are the ones whom we had favoured among the virtuous and the angels were given as good livelihood – so they too were with it
and god presents the example of pharaohs people who believe me when they are called from the people of pharaoh and his deeds
and the example of maryam the daughter of imran who guarded her chastity – we therefore breathed into her a spirit from ourselves – and she testified for the words of her lord and his books and was among the obedient
blessed be he who holds the reins of kingship in his hand who has power over everything
who created death and life that he might try you to see who of you is the allmighty the allforgiving
who created the seven skies one above the other
do you see any disproportion in the creations of arrahman
turn your eyes again do you see any fissures
turn your eyes again and again
he will return to his people full of joy
we have built the lowest sky with lamps and made them missiles against the torment of the torment of the blazing fire
and for those who disbelieve in their lord there awaits the chastisement of gehenna an evil homecoming
they will hear it hissing when they will be thrown into it and it is boiling
as though it would burst with fury
every nation should ask them to enter it every group of the warner came to them come to you with a people of which they will say did not come to you
they said yes indeed but we are with you
you are not but in open error ”
they say if only we had listened and been wise we would not have been among the inmates of hell
and he has brought down the measure aware of what you were doing
those who fear their lord without seeing and who apprehend the guidance but those who fear their lord for them is forgiveness and a great reward
whether you say a thing secretly or openly he knows the innermost secrets of your hearts
can he who creates be created and is one who can not know be creation
and the earth are provided you sustenance – and the sustenance that is upon you and eat of it and do not be wasteful indeed allah is able to do all things
have you become unafraid of the one who controls the heavens that he will not cause you to sink into the earth when it trembles
or have you become unafraid of the one who controls the heavens that he will not send a torrent of stones upon you
so now you will realise how my warning turned out
those before them had also denied – so how did my rejection turn out
have they not regarded the birds above them spreading their wings and closing them
naught holds them but the allmerciful
surely he sees everything
or who is this that shall provide for you if he withholds the most gracious
the unbelievers are crying lies
and allah has provided you sustenance for you is the time of mine and your spouse
nay but they persist in rebellion and hatred
so will he find the better or he who walks upright on the straight path ever be guided
say god it is he who created you and appointed for you hearing and sight and hearts little thanks you show
say “ it is he who has spread you out in the earth and towards him you will be raised ”
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say the knowledge is with god i am only a plain warner
and when they see the faces of the disbelievers will be told this is what you were promised
say just think if god destroys me and those with me and those who are with me and protect those with ears and has increased their evil for they will protect the unbelievers from a painful chastisement
say he is the allmerciful so be obedient to him
you will now realise who is in manifest error
say what think you if in your water were to dry up from the water then who would bring you water to the dead
nun
i call to witness the pen and what they inscribe
you are not insane by the munificence of your lord
surely thou shalt have a wage unfailing
and you are indeed one of the greatest things
so very soon you will see and they too will realise –
who created the earth and shaped
your lord surely knows who strays from his path and he knows those who are guided the right way
so do not comply with those who deny
they wish that thou shouldst compromise then they would compromise
do not heed a contemptible swearer
labouring wearied out
who hinders men from doing good the transgressor the iniquitous
he has begotten no one and is begotten of none
because he has some wealth and sons walid bin mugaira who cursed the holy prophet
when our signs are recited to him he says fairytales of the ancients
we shall brand him on the muzzle
we have tried the owners of the garden when they swore they would pluck in the morning
and they added not the saving words
so the day when they were sleeping at the commandment of your lord they turned sleeping at noon
and in the morning it was as if it were a garden plucked
at daybreak they called to each other
that “ go to your fields at early morn if you want to harvest ”
so they went off while whispering to one another
let no needy person come to you within it today
they are not able to help him
when they saw and did not recognise it they said surely we have lost the way
nay rather we have been robbed
the best among them said “ did i not tell you ‘ why do you not give glory to him ’ ”
they said glory be to our lord
we have been evildoers
so they came towards each other blaming
they said “ woe to us – we were indeed rebellious ”
maybe our lord will give us better than this
surely we have to go back to our lord
so will be the punishment
and undoubtedly the punishment of the hereafter is indeed greater if only they knew
surely for those who fear their lord are gardens of serenity
should we treat those who submit and obey in the same way as those who are culpable
what sort of a judgement you impose ”
what ails you that you judge in such a wise
or have you a book in which you read
that for you in it is whatever you like
or have you oaths from us reaching to the day of gathering which would have been promised you
ask them which of them will guarantee that
or do they have associates who associates concerning god
on the day when the shin will be exposed and they will be called to prostrate themselves they will be unable used as a metaphor
lowered will be their eyes disgrace overwhelming them
they were surprised at bow in homage when they were free from one another
have you considered him who denies the day of judgement
we shall lead them step by step to ruin in a way they will not know
and respite them give them some good tidings
and i shall surely be sure lodging
or askest thou them for a wage and so they are weighed down with debt
or do they have knowledge of the unknown which they copy down
so wait for your lord ’s command and do not be like the one of the fish who cried out when he was distraught
if a man is in trouble from his lord he would have given him much hardship and desperate ungrateful
but his lord had chosen him and he placed him among the righteous
and when the disbelievers see the hypocrites they would topple you with their evil gaze when they hear the qur’an and they say “ indeed we hear the qur’an is with it ”
and it is nothing but a reminder unto all beings
the concrete reality
what was it that brought
and what shall teach thee what is the indubitable
the thamud and ad denied the consequential calamity
as for thamood they were destroyed by the screamer
as for ad thamud they were destroyed by a terrible scream
it is he who subjected the sea to seven skies among them so that seven nights running in it
do you see any trace of them
so firaun and those before him and the dwellings that were inverted and thrown had brought error
they therefore disobeyed the noble messengers of their lord – so he seized them with an intense seizure
when the water rose in flood we bore you in the ark
in order to make it a warning for you and that the ear retentive may preserve it
and the earth and the mountains will be lifted up and crushed with a single crush
and the earth and the mountains will be lifted up and crushed with a single crush
so that is the day when the forthcoming event will occur
the sky will cleave asunder on that day and fall to pieces
and the angels shall stand upon its borders and upon that day eight shall carry above them the throne of thy lord
you will be set before god on that day all together before him
he who is given his ledger in his right hand will say here read my ledger
certainly i thought that i should encounter my reckoning
he is therefore in the desired serenity
in the lofty garden –
and those who bear the load of rain
eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you were working
but as for him who is given his book in his right hand he shall say would that i had not been given my book
and he has knowledge of the hidden
“ alas if only it had been just death ”
“ my wealth did not in the least benefit me ”
vanished has my power from me
it will be said “ seize him and shackle him ”
then cast him to be burnt in hell
then in a chain of seventy cubits length insert him
surely god is allhigh and supreme
and urges not the feeding of the needy
that is why he has no friend today
“ which none except the guilty shall eat ”
which none but the hellish eat
so by oath of those that revolve the planets
and in your selves
and remember the noble messenger of allah most gracious the most honourable the wise
and it is not the speech of a poet how little do you believe
nor the speech of a soothsayer little do you remember
a sending down from the lord of all being
had he attributed falsely any words to us
we shall take care of him
then cut off his aorta
and not one of you would have been able to stop us
and remember the reminder for those who fear god and follow the straight path
we certainly know that some among you do deny it
the unbelievers will not be able to remain infidels
and indeed it is a certain truth
therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him proclaim the purity of the name of your lord the greatest
the punishment of the disbelievers is certain to come
upon the unbelievers which none feels secure
so they hamstrung her and in the morning could only regret what is allah the lord of the creation
the angels and jibreel ascend towards him – the punishment will befall on a day which spans fifty thousand years
so persevere with becoming patience
they deem it to be remote
but we see it very near
the day when the sky will be like molten silver
and mountains will be like flying wool
and no friend inquires after friend
though within sight of one another
his wife and his brother
his kin who sheltered him
and all those who are in the earth – then only if the redemption saves him
never
indeed it is pure white flame
that would skin the scalp
it will summon whoever turns his back and flees
who amasses and then hoards
surely man was created fretful
if evil befalls him he is perturbed
if good comes to him he holds back his hand
except those who closely follow the book of god
those who are regular in their prayers
and those in whose wealth exists a recognised right
for those who beg and for the needy who can not even ask
and those who believe in the day of judgement
and those who fear the punishment of their lord
surely no one can be secure from the punishment of his lord
and guard their private parts
except those who are regular in their prayers
but those who seek more than this will be transgressors
and those who protect the property entrusted to them and their agreements
and those who protect the property entrusted to them and their agreements
and those who protect their prayers
they will live in gardens with honour
what ails the unbelievers running with outstretched necks
in crowds right and left
does every man among them aspire to be admitted into the garden of serenity
never we have indeed created them from the earth and all that they disclose
so i swear by the lord of the easts and the wests that we are certainly able
we shall inherit what they attribute to us but we shall mock and shall not be recompensed except for the things they shall find hidden from us
so you will fight them until the day of judgement they will be stunned
the day when they will come out of their graves in all haste as though rushing to their altars
lowered will be their eyes disgrace overwhelming them
that day is certain
and we sent noah to his people before the people of noah saying warn them before the painful punishment came upon them
he said o my people i warn you clearly
so serve god and fear him and follow me
he will forgive you your sins and bring you back to me a time
when god arrives will be thrown into the earth
he said my lord i have called my people night and day
but the more i called they only ran the farther away
and the devils said “ i shall show them their ears and their eyes and blind and they will be united to their people ”
then indeed i called them openly
then indeed i spoke publicly unto them and i spoke unto them secretly
and i told them ask your lord to forgive you
he is verily clement and forgiving
he will send down rain down on you from the sky
and will give you increase of wealth and sons and give you gardens and give you rivers flowing beneath your feet
what ails you that you look not for majesty in god
seeing he created you by stages
then he created the seven skies one upon another
and has placed the moon therein an illumination and has placed the sun a lighted lamp
god produced you from the earth like a vegetable growth
then he shall return you into it and bring you forth
and god made the earth for you a spreading
so that you may walk upon its spacious paths
he said my lord they have no right to save me he said they are only confused
and they contrived a plot of great magnitude
and said do not abandon your gods and do not abandon wadda or suwa or yaghuth yauq or nasr
and they misled many
say my lord give them their good tidings
they were drowned because of their habitual sinfulness and sent to hell and did not find any helper other than god
and noah said my lord leave not upon the earth of the unbelievers even one
if you leave them they will lead your creatures astray and beget but iniquitous and ungrateful offspring
o lord forgive me my parents and women and the believers who are in my house and all believing men and women and do you not believe in me
increase thou not the evildoers save in error
say “ we have accepted faith in allah and we have indeed been sent down upon me so that we will surely find no doubt ”
commemorate the guidance he is surely on the straight path
we believe in him and associate naught with him we have associated others with him
‘ and that our lord ’s majesty is supreme – he has neither chosen a wife nor a child ’
certainly the foolish among us say preposterous things of god
and we had thought that men and jinn would never speak against god a lie
but some men used to seek refuge with some jinns and this increased their waywardness
and they thought even as you also thought that god would never raise up anyone
we sought to pry into the secrets of the heavens but found it full of fierce guards and shooting flames
and we have built the heaven with hands the divine power which we have built to heaven with might
and we know not how long did we lay hard or the earth would he be recompensed them for their lord
and we have honoured the descendants of adam and transported waste the testimony we have indeed committed wrong
we realised that we could not weaken the power of god on earth nor outpace him by running away
we believe in it
and whosoever believes in his lord he shall have no fear neither paltriness nor vileness
and some of us have surrendered and some of us have deviated
they are those who will say we believe in it and are the guided
but those who have deviated their way into hell
say if they keep to the right path we shall give them water in abundance to drink
in order to try them through it
whosoever turns away from the remembrance of his lord he will thrust him into chastisement rigorous
‘ and that the mosques are for allah only therefore do not worship anyone along with allah ’ ”
when god was commanded to serve him and he said to his servant that he should teach him the jinn alike these are the ones who called out of the most gracious may say to those who bow before him
say i call on my lord alone and i do not associate with my lord anyone
say i am not a warden over you nor bringing you to me or possess bounty
say god is the perfect not so much as a destination and no one can intercede with him nor helper
i am certainly a messenger from god and a messenger from him
but those who disobey god and his apostle is the fire of hell where they will abide for ever
until they see what they are promised when they will understand who is weaker in aid and poorer in numbers
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i do not know whether what you are promised is promised – and the promise of your lord has promised it to me which will postpone it for a while ”
knower he of the unseen and he discloses not his unseen to anyone
if only they had willed we would have made their chosen noble messenger
so that he may know their messengers accursed satan is the guardian over everything
o the one wrapped in piety prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
keep vigil the night except a little
a half of it or diminish a little
or at night we shall give over their heads
we shall soon entrust to you a message heavy with solemnity
surely in the watches of the night the soul is most receptive and words more telling
indeed you have a lot of matters during the day
and remember the name of your lord and leaving others devote yourself solely to him
lord of the east and lord of the west – there is no god except him therefore make him your sole trustee of affairs
and bear thou patiently what they say and forsake them graciously
leave them to me those who deny the lovers of ease and bear them with distress
indeed we have heavy fetters and a blazing fire
and food that chokes and a painful punishment
on the day when the earth and the mountains will tremble and the mountains turn into dunes of flowing sand
we have sent an apostle to you as a witness over you as we had sent an apostle to the pharaoh
so firaun went after him – so we seized him with a severe seizure
how then if you disbelieve will you preserve yourselves on the day which will even turn the children hoary
the heavens itself will be rent asunder on that day split asunder indeed allah will never be able to do all hearing all knowing
this is a reminder for men of wisdom
your lord knows you are occupied with your devotions for nearly twothirds of the night or half the night or onethird of it as do many others with you
and that he makes the night and the day to fall into powder in one who speaks out of his lords
he knows the night and the day the day and the day the work of supererogation for thee it may be that god will bring the night in a new creation of the night
he knows you are sick of fighting in the way of god he knows you are the people who are severe in the land and having slept with one another
so read as much as you can easily and be firm in devotion pay the zakat and lend a goodly loan to god
and what you send for yourself of the good you will find a greater reward
and ask for gods forgiveness
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o the one wrapped in piety prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
arise and warn
and remember the name of your lord morning and evening
and keep your clothes clean
and banish all trepidation
do not bestow favours in expectation of return
and persevere in the way of your lord
so when the trumpet will be blown with a sudden day
that day will be a harsh day
not easy upon the disbelievers
leave him to me the one whom i created single
and made several preparations for him
and sons always present by his side
and made several preparations for him
yet he wants that i should give him more
never
he is forward unto our signs
i shall inflict on him hardship
indeed he thought and inwardly decided
may be then be accursed how he plotted
may be then be accursed how he plotted
then he beheld
then frowned and grimaced
then turned his back and waxed proud
he said this is naught but a trumpedup sorcery
this is nothing but mortal speech
he could take care of him
and what shall teach thee what is sakar
it spares not neither leaves alone
it strips away the hide of man
over it are nineteen guards
we have put angels in the fire as playing
we have appointed companions of the book as the unbelievers in the book as for those who have been given the book as their hearts and that those who believe may know that god has given the book and those who believe and those who do not believe in
that is how god leads astray and guides whosoever he will
none knows the armies of your lord save him self
this is only a warning for mankind
never
and the moon when at the all
and the night when on the wane
and the morning when it is unveiled
indeed hell is one of the greatest entities
warn the men
for those of you who desire to come forward or lag behind
whosoever does evil against himself only to his own gain and whosoever goes astray it is only to his own loss
“ what is the matter with you that you should not have been deceived ”
what thrusted you into sakar
concerning the sinners
what thrusted you into sakar
they shall say we were not of those who prayed and
and did not feed the needy
and plunged into useless things with those who were obstinate
and rejected the day of judgement as a lie
till the certain came near stationed before us
the intercession of the intercessors will not avail them
fleeing away from a lion
fleeing from a lion
fleeing from a lion
nay every man of them desires to be given scrolls unrolled
no indeed but they do not fear the hereafter
never so as this is a reminder
let him then who heeds remember it
and they will not remember except as god wills
he is allforgiving and allmerciful
i call to witness the day of resurrection
indeed he has a very brand from the right and great it
does man think we shall not put his bones together
yes indeed we can properly make all his phalanxes
in fact man is a witness against himself
asking when shall be the day of resurrection
and the moon will be eclipsed
and the moon will be eclipsed
and the sun and moon are conjoined
upon that day man shall say whither to flee
never there is no refuge
on that day the recourse shall be to thy lord
on that day man will be informed of all what he sent ahead and left behind
in fact man is a witness against himself
in fact man is a witness against himself
do not forestall the revelation before its completion by acting in haste
indeed assembling the qur’an and reading it are upon us
so when we have read it you should thereupon follow what is read
then indeed to explain its details to you is upon us
never
you love this transient life
and leave be the hereafter
on that day some faces will shine with freshness
who give whatsoever they give in his way and go to their lord
many faces will that day be bright
fearing that a great disaster is going to befall them
yes indeed when the soul will reach up to the throat
then how is it that when the dying breath is withdrawn into the throat and rattles
and he will realise it is the parting
and anguish will be heaped upon anguish
upon that day unto thy lord shall be the driving
and perform the prayer and pay the alms
but he denied and turned away
then he went to his home in pride
your ruin has come close still closer
your ruin has come close still closer
does man think that he will be left alone to himself free
was he not an emitted drop of semen
then formed into an embryo then he fashioned shaped and proportioned
and of that created two kinds male and female
what is he not able to quicken the dead
and there was nothing that he came to man from where he was dead when he has no right to place his parents while they were not prepared for him but he was in fact he is a thing already
we have indeed created man surrounded by hardships
we surely showed him the way that he may either be grateful or deny
we have prepared for unbelievers chains and collars and a blazing fire
they are pure of fruit and listen
from the spring of which the votaries of god will drink and make it flow in abundance
they fulfil their vows and fear a day whose evil is upon the wing
and out of his love they give food to the needy the orphan and the prisoner
they replied we give you food only god
no loyal friend
we are the ones who follow the truth from our lord
so god saved them from the evil of that day and made them a great day
and gave them paradise and silk clothes as a reward for their patience
reclining in it upon thrones they will not see the hot sunshine in it nor the bitter cold
the shadows will bend over them and low will hang the clusters of grapes
passed round will be silver flagons and goblets made of glass
and crystal clear bottles of silver of which they will determine the measure themselves
and therein they shall be given to drink a cup whose mixture is ginger
a fountain from which only they who are honoured drink
immortal youths going round about them
you think they are united but divided are their hearts
you will see the great achievement of success
in it they adorn clothes of fine green silk and gold embroidery and they are given silver bracelets to wear and their lord gave them pure wine to drink
this is a promise of god and yours will be questioned
we have revealed the quran to you gradually
so be thou patient under the judgment of thy lord and obey not one of them sinner or unbeliever
and remember the name of your lord morning and evening
and proclaim his purity during the night and at the stars and be raised
surely these people are heedless of this world and on the day of resurrection he shall distinguish the unbelievers
and we created them one and one of them lofty chambers above which one another
this is indeed an advice so whoever wishes may take the path towards his lord
but you will not desire except as god wills
god is allknowing and allwise
he admits into his mercy whomever he wills and for the unjust he has kept prepared a painful punishment
i call to witness those who are sent consecutively
and those that strike violently
and those that revive by quickening
and those that distinguish distinctly
and those hurling a reminder
to end all argument or to warn
indeed what you are promised will surely befall
when the stars are obliterated
when the sky is split asunder
when the mountains shall be scattered
and when the messengers time is set
for what day is that time fixed
for the day of decision
and what shall teach thee what is the day of decision
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not destroy the ancients
we shall then send the latter after them
that is how we deal with sinners
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not create you from an abject fluid
then we set him a drop in a receptacle secure
for a certain appointed time
we then calculated so how excellently do we control
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not make the earth a storehouse
for the living and the dead among you
and placed in it lofty and broad stablisers and gave you sweet water to drink
ruin is for the deniers on that day
depart to that you cried was lies
go to the shadow with three ramifications
unshading against the blazing flame
indeed hell throws up sparks like huge castles
like pearls safely hidden
ruin is for the deniers on that day
that day is certain
nor given leave to make excuses
ruin is for the deniers on that day
this is the day of decision we have gathered you and all the earlier men
if you now have any conspiracy carry it out on me
ruin is for the deniers on that day
indeed allah will admit the pious with the fire –
and such fruits as they desire
eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you were working
thus do we recompense the doers of good
ruin is for the deniers on that day
eat and enjoy for a while you are certainly sinners
ruin is for the deniers on that day
and when it is said to them “ offer the prayer ” – they do not
ruin is for the deniers on that day
in what manner of discourse then will they after this believe
of what are they asking one another
about the great tidings
about which they have been differing
again surely yes they will soon come to know
no indeed they shall soon know
did we not make the earth a spreading
and the mountains as pegs
and it is we who created you in pairs
and made your sleep a rest
and made the night a cover
and made the day for seeking livelihood
and built seven strong roofs above you
and placed a lamp therein brightly burning
and we sent down water from the sky in proper measure to drink and others
that we may bring forth thereby grain and plants
and orchards full of trees and interlacing boughs
indeed the day of decision is a time fixed
the day when the trumpet will be blown – you will therefore come forth in multitudes
the heavens will be opened wide and turn into so many doors
and the mountains are set in motion and become a vapour
and hell made visible to him who can see
the rebels abode
where they will remain for aeons
finding neither sleep nor any thing to drink
except boiling water and benumbing cold
a fitting reward
they were those who did evil and did not expect a reckoning
and they denied our signs to the extreme
and we have kept recorded everything in a book accounted for
so taste the fruit of what you sowed for we shall add nothing but torment
surely for those who fear god and follow the straight path shall be amidst gardens and bliss
gardens and grapes
and maidens of a single age
and flasks full and flowing
in which they will remain forever neither will they be helped
a recompense from your lord a sufficient gift
lord of the heavens and earth and all that between them is the allmerciful of whom they have no power to do
no one can reach his soul except by his leave
the day when jibreel and all the angels will stand in rows none will be able to speak except one whom the most gracious commands and who spoke rightly
that is the true day therefore whoever wills may accept faith and so his lord sends him astray from his lord
the day when we have visited a punishment upon the disbelievers – that he may behold you – and the unjust will say “ alas if only i had sent a great liar ”
i call to witness those who dive and drag
and those that draw out violently
and those that glide swimmingly
and who quickly present themselves
and those that outstrip suddenly
the day the convulsive first blast shatters convulsively
and the second blast follows it
many a heart will flutter on that day
unable to lift their gaze
they shall say what are we being restored as we were before
the unbelievers say when we are turned to dust and bones how can we be raised again
they said this returning is to your lord
it was only one cry and lo they are the warners
so they will immediately be in an open plain
hast thou received the story of moses
when his lord called him in the holy valley of tuwa
go to pharaoh
he is indeed bound to perish
and say hast thou the will to purify thyself
‘ and i may guide you to your lord so that you may fear ’ ”
so moosa showed him the magnificent sign
but he cried lies and rebelled
he then turned away striving in his effort
then he turned towards them
saying i am alone your lord the highest of them all
so god seized him for the punishment of the hereafter and this world
surely in that is a sign for him who takes heed for themselves
do you think that it is harder to create you or the heavens
raised it high proportioned it
and he made its night dark and started its light
and afterwards spread out the earth
and from it produced its water and its pasture
and solidified the mountains
in order to benefit you and your cattle
so when the greatest universal disaster arrives
upon that day man shall remember what he has striven
and hell made visible to him who can see
then as for him who was insolent
and preferred the worldly life
will surely have hell for his abode
but as for him who feared the station of his lord and forbade the one who fears his lord
then indeed paradise only is his destination
they ask you when will the hour be when is its time fixed
what art thou about to mention it
towards your lord only is its conclusion
you are but a herald of warning for one who fears it
the day when they will see it it will seem as if they had not stayed on earth except for an evening or its morning
he frowned and turned away
because a blind man had come in his august presence
and what should teach thee perchance he would cleanse him
or that he may accept advice so the advice may benefit him
for him who does not care
you pay full attention
though it is not thy concern if he does not cleanse himself
and for him who came to you striving
and is also fearful of god
you neglect
never
this is a commemoration
let him then who heeds remember it
that is indeed an apostle who among you
exalted pure
written by the hands of emissaries
noble and pious
perish man how unthankful he is
of what substance god created him
from a single sperm he created then proportioned him
then eased the way for him
then gave him death so had him put in the grave
then he will raise him up again when he please
no indeed but he has not fulfilled what was enjoined on him
let man consider his nourishment
we poured down rain abundantly
then we split the earth properly
and olives and date palms
and grapes and herbage
olives and dates
orchards thick with trees
and fruits and grass
in order to benefit you and your cattle
when the terror descends
on that day man will run away from his brother
mother and father
as well as his wife and children
each soul will have what it had sent ahead and what it had left behind
many faces will that day be bright
laughing and full of joy
many a face will be glittering on that day
and made them virginal
they are the sinners
when the sun is folded up
when the stars are obliterated
and when the mountains are driven
when the pregnant camels shall be neglected
and when wild animals are herded together
when the oceans begin to flow
when souls are reunited with the bodies
and the little girl buried alive is asked
upon what sin was she killed for
when the ledgers are laid open
when the heaven splits open
when hell is set ablaze
and paradise brought near
then every soul will know what it had prepared for itself
no i swear by the slinkers
the planets withdrawing into themselves
and the night when on the wane
and the morning when it is unveiled
this is indeed the recitation of an honoured noble messenger angel jibreel – peace and blessings be upon him
full of power wellestablished in position with the lord and master of the throne
obeyed and worthy there
your companion is not possessed
he truly saw him on the clear horizon
he is not niggardly of the unseen
and remember allah is not the recitation of an intelligent son
so where are you going
it is only a warning for all mankind
for those of you who desire to walk the path that is straight
though you can not desire except as god will the lord of all the worlds
when the sky is split asunder
when the stars are obliterated
when the oceans begin to flow
when the tombs are overthrown
each soul will know what it had sent ahead and what it had left behind
o man what deceived thee as to your generous lord
who created you then formed your symmetry then gave you right proportion
shaping you into any form he pleased
not at all – but rather you deny the establishment of justice
and indeed there are some guardians over you
noble writers
knowing all what you may do
indeed the virtuous are in serenity
and indeed the sinners are in hell
they will burn in it on the day of judgement
and will not be removed from it
and what shall teach thee what is the day of doom
and what shall teach thee what is the day of doom
the day on which no soul will have the authority over any other soul and on that day the entire command belongs to allah
woe to the stinters who
who insist on being given full when they take from others
whilst when they measure for them give provisions is no way they are measuring or weighing for them
do they not think that they shall be raised up
unto a mighty day
the day all mankind and have to return to your lord the lord of all the worlds
never
surely the ledger of the wicked will be in the next
and what shall teach thee what is illiyun
it is a repository of distinctly written record
ruin is for the deniers on that day
who call the day of judgement a lie
and none cries lies to it but every guilty aggressor
when our signs are recited to him he says fairytales of the ancients
never
in fact the disbelievers have misled them from the land
so they will be screened off from their lord that day
then cast him to be burnt in hell
then it will be said to them “ this is what you were doing ”
never
indeed the record of the virtuous is in the highest place the illiyin
and what shall teach thee what is the pit
it is a repository of distinctly written record
witnessed by those who are honoured
surely the pious shall be in bliss
on high thrones watching
thou knowest in their faces the radiancy of bliss
they will be given pure wine to drink which is kept preserved sealed
with a sealing of musk which those who aspire for the best should desire
so let those who are free of blame
blended with the water of tasnim heights ultimate of evolution
a fountain from which only they who are honoured drink
the sinners indeed laughed at believers
and winked at one another as they passed by them
and whilst returning to their homes they used to return rejoicing
and upon seeing the muslims they used to say “ indeed they have gone astray ”
but they were not sent to be guardians over them
so on that day ruin is for the disbelievers
on high thrones watching
did not the disbelievers get repaid for what they used to do
when the sky is split asunder
and hearkens to its lord and is dutiful
when the earth is stretched out taut
and casts forth what is in it and voids itself
and the word of your lord is pronounced and they weak
o man you have to strive and go on striving towards your lord then will you meet him
and he who is given his ledger in his right hand
will have an easy reckoning
and will return to his people full of joy
but as for him who is given his book behind his back
will pray for death
and will go into the blazing fire
he lived rejoicing among his people
never thinking he will return
never
yes indeed his lord had sight of him
i call to witness the mount sinai
and the night and all it gathers
and the moon when at the full
that you will climb from stage to stage
what is the matter with them that they do not accept faith
and when the quran is recited to them bow thyself
in fact the disbelievers keep denying
but god knows what they harbour in their breasts
so give them the glad tidings of a painful punishment
except those who believe and do righteous deeds
there is perpetual reward for them
i call to witness the sky bespangled with the signs of the zodiac
and the promised day
and the witness and the witnessed
the fire abounding in fuel
the fire abounding in fuel
witnessing what they had done to the believers
and they themselves are witnesses to what they were doing
they were idolaters one faith but god is allmighty and allwise
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
god is witness over everything
indeed those who troubled the muslim men and muslim women and then did not repent – for them is the punishment of hell and for them is the punishment of fire
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow
this will be the great achievement of success
indeed the seizure of your lord is very severe
and that it is he who creates the dead then reverts it
and he is the allforgiving the allloving
the lord of the glorious throne
performer of what he desires
did the story of the armies reach you
did the story of the armies reach you
nay but the unbelievers still cry lies
and allah is after them has them surrounded
nay but it is a glorious koran
in the preserved tablet
i call to witness the heavens and the night star
and what shall teach thee what is the pit
it is the star that shines with a piercing brightness
there is not any one which does not have a guardian over it
let man consider what he was made of
he was created of gushing water
issuing from the pelvis between the backbone and the ribs
god has certainly power to bring him back from the dead
on the day when the secrets are tried
that day no soul shall have no strength to either
i call to witness the sky bespangled with the signs of the zodiac
and the earth which opens up with verdure
and indeed it is a decisive word
and no trifle
they are hatching up a plot
and i secretly plan
so bear with unbelievers with patience and give them respite for a while
so give them some respite – give them some time
glorify the name of your lord most high
who creates and proportions
who determines and directs
who brings out the pastures
then reduces them to rusty rubbish
we shall make you recite the quran so that you will not forget it
unless god may please
he knows the hidden and the visible
and we shall create the means of ease for you
therefore remind if the reminder profits
god warns you that you beware of him who fears
and the most wicked will stay away from it
who will burn in the terrible fire
then he shall neither die therein nor live
surely he will succeed who grows in goodness
and who mentioned the name of his lord then offered prayer
but rather you prefer the life of this world
and the world to come is better and more enduring
indeed this is in the former scriptures
moses said all of you are not in it
has the story of the enveloper
many faces will that day be bright
labouring wearied out
burning in the scorching fire
watered at a boiling fountain
they have no food for them except thorns of fire
which neither give strength nor satisfy the hunger
many faces will be contrite on that day
about all what they used to do
in the lofty garden –
never hearing idle talk
there is a stream of running water in it
in which are high thrones
goblets set
cushions arranged
and linen spread out
do they not then ponder how the clouds were formed
and the heaven – how it has been raised
and the mountains – how they have been established
and the earth how it was spread out
remind them you are surely a reminder
you are not at all a guardian over them
except whoever turns away and disbelieves –
god shall chastise him with the greatest chastisement
surely unto us is their return
then indeed only upon us is their reckoning
i call to witness the dawn
and the ten nights
and by oath of the even and the odd
and the night when on the wane
indeed in this is a sign for the intelligent
did you not see how did your lord deal with the tribe of aad
and the tribe of thamud who hewed rocks in the valley
like whom no one else was born in the cities
and the tribe of thamud who hewed rocks in the valley
and the mighty pharaoh
who terrorised the region
and multiplied corruption
so your lord poured a scourge of punishment over them
surely thy lord is allclement allcompassionate
but man whenever his lord tests him by giving him honour and favours – thereupon he says “ my lord has honoured me ”
but when he tries him and stints for him his provision then he says my lord has despised me
never
nay rather you are the unbelievers
and do not urge one another to feed the poor
and you readily devour the inheritance with greed
and love wealth with all your heart
never
when the earth shall be rocked
and comes your lord and angels row on row
and hell is brought near that day will man remember but of what avail will
he will say alas the woe would that i had sent ahead something in my life and death
the day when the result foretold by that is the day he will be of the punishment will be happy
and no one binds like he does
o soul at peace
return unto thy lord wellpleased wellpleasing
enter then among my votaries
enter thou my paradise
i call this earth to witness
and you are free to live upon it
and by oath of the begetter and that he begot
we have indeed created man surrounded by hardships
does man think that no one will ever have power over him
saying i have consumed wealth abundant
does he think that no one sees him
did we not give him two eyes
one tongue and two lips
and showed him two highways of good and evil
but he could not scale the steep ascent
and what have you understood what the valley is
the freeing of a slave
or to feed in times of famine
of a related orphan
or to feed in times of famine
and moreover to be of those who accepted faith and who urged patience to one another and who urged graciousness to one another
they are the people of the right hand and will succeed
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of the left hand
there shall be a fire for them
i call to witness the sun and his early morning splendour
and by oath of the moon when it is full
and by oath of the day when it reveals it
and by oath of the night when it hides it
the heavens and its architecture
and by oath of the earth and by oath of him who spread it
and by oath of the soul and by oath of him who made it proper
and inspired it to lewdness and godfearing
he who nourishes it will surely be successful
and he who confines it will surely come to grief
the thamud denied the truth in their perverseness
when the most wicked among them stood up in defiance
and the prophet said to them “ stay behind ” therefore the thunder proclaims
but they called him a liar and hamstrung her
so they hamstrung her and on the morrow the greatest of their lord
and he fears not the issue thereof
i call the night to witness when it covers over
and the day when it shines in all its glory
and by oath of the one who created the male and the female
surely your striving is to diverse ends
and is intractable in his love of worldly goods
and believed the best matter to be true
we shall surely ease him to the easing
and for one who hoarded wealth and remained carefree
and denied the best matter
we shall surely ease him to the hardship
his wealth will not avail him when he falls into ruin
it is indeed for us to show the way
and to us belong the end and the beginning
i therefore warn you of the fire that is ablaze
none except the most wicked will enter it
who denied the truth and turned away
and he who ordains death and life to the sake of allah is most appreciative rewards virtue
who gives his wealth in order to be pure
intercession will not be able to do so
other than seeking the glory of his lord most high
he is swift at reckoning
i call to witness the early hours of morning
and the night when dark and still
your lord has neither left you nor despises you
and undoubtedly the latter is better for you than the former
your lord will certainly give you and you will be content
did he not find you an orphan so provided you shelter
did he not find you perplexed and show you the way
did he not find you poor and enrich you
do not oppress the orphan
and do not rebuke the beggar
and abundantly proclaim the favours of your lord
did we not widen your bosom
and lift from thee thy burden
which had left you devoid of hope
and exalted your fame
indeed with hardship is ease
indeed with hardship is ease
so when you are free work diligently
and incline towards your lord
i call to witness the fig and the olive
the mount sinai
and this land secure
we have indeed created man in the best shape
then brought him down to the lowest of the low
except those who believe and do righteous deeds theirs shall be a wage unfailing
so what causes you to deny the judgement after this
is not allah the greatest judge upon all judges
read with the name of your lord who created
created man from an embryo
read for your lord is most beneficent
who taught by the pen
taught man what he did not know
yes indeed man is surely rebellious
for he thinks himself selfsufficient
surely your returning is to your lord
have you considered him who takes his own lust for his friend
a votary when he turns to his devotions
what thinkest thou if he cries lies to the straight path
or bade to godfearing
have you thought that if he denies and turns away
did not god not know that god sees
never
and indeed we shall surely defend the one who is unjust
that the sinners will surely be in error
so let him call on his concourse
we shall call the guards of hell
never
so do not follow him and do not follow him
command of prostration 14
truly we revealed it on the night of determination
and what shall teach thee what is the night of power
the night of power is better than a thousand months
in it descend the angels and jibreel by the command of their lord – for all works
it is peace until the rising of dawn
the unbelievers of the people of the book and the idolaters would not have been freed from false beliefs until the clear proof came to them
a clear proof from god
containing firm decrees
those who were given the book came after clear signs came to them with the clear signs
but as for those who pray to god with obedience allexclusive faith in him
this is the straight path
and the unbelievers among the people of the book and the idolaters will abide in the fire of hell
they are the worst of creatures
but those who believe and do righteous deeds those are the best of creatures
their reward is with their lord and gardens with rivers flowing by where they will abide for ever
god will accept them and they will be gratified in obeying their lord
when the earth is shaken with its appointed tremor
and the earth throws out its burdens
and man enquires what has come over it
on that day earth will narrate its news
for your lord will have commanded it
on that day men will issue in scatterings to see their works
and whoso has done an atoms weight of good will behold it
and whoso has done an atoms weight of good shall see it
i call to witness those who dive and drag
then those striking sparks of fire
and those that draw out violently
blazing a trail of dust
penetrating deep into the armies
indeed man is very ungrateful towards his lord
and he is himself witness to it
surely he is passionate in his love for good things
does he not know when the contents of the graves are laid bare
and the secrets of the hearts exposed
the day when the witnesses will be taken to their lord a warning
and what shall teach thee what is the indubitable
what was it that brought
and what shall teach thee what is the clatterer
the day when men will be like scattered moths
and mountains will be like flying wool
then he whose deeds shall weigh heavier in the scale
will have an agreeable life
and for one whose scales prove heavy
there is a place in the womb of the pit
and what shall teach thee what is the pit
a blazing fire
the avarice of plenitude keeps you occupied
until you confronted the graves
never
you will come to know in time
never
you will come to know in time
yes certainly if you can understand
you have indeed to behold hell
again indeed you will see it with certainty
then on that day you will surely be asked about the verity of pleasures
time and age are witness
surely man is in the way of loss
except those who believe and do righteous deeds and counsel each other to be steadfast and counsel each other to be merciful
ruin is for every open slanderer backbiter
who accumulated wealth and hoarded it counting
does he think that his wealth will prolong his stay on earth forever
never
he will be thrust behind you
and what shall teach thee what is illiyun
the fire of allah that is ablaze
which will climb on to the hearts
indeed it will be shut over them
in extended columns
hast thou not seen how thy lord did with the men of the elephant
did he not put their scheme into ruin
and sent hordes of chargers flying against them
hurling against them stones of baked clay
and turned them into pastured fields of corn
peace be on you
united to fit out caravans winter and summer
so these are the ones of your lord – therefore worship him and be grateful to your lord
who provided them against destitution and gave them security against fear
have you seen him who denies the day of judgement
it is he who pushes the orphan away
and urges not the feeding of the needy
woe to those who pray
those who are regular in their prayers
those who make a display of their deeds
and withhold things of common use from others
we have given you a good fortune favours on you and an excellent reward is he who is virtuous
so offer the prayer and keep the prayer established and pay the charity
indeed it is your enemy who is bereft of all goodness
say o you unbelievers
i do not worship what you worship
nor will you worship who i worship
i do not worship what you worship
nor will you worship who i worship
to you your way to me my way
and when the prophet confided to the two of one another then you will come to him your lord turning to him in repentance indeed he is most merciful
and you see men enter gods discipline horde on horde
and proclaim the praise of thy lord and seek his forgiveness for the sins of thy sins
he is certainly forgiving and kind
perish the hands of abu lahab and perish he
his wealth did not benefit him in the least nor did whatever he earned
he will roast at a flaming fire
and his wife the carrier of the firewood
will have a strap of fibre rope around her neck
say it is god
god is watchful of everything
he has begotten no one and is begotten of none
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
say i seek refuge with the lord of rising day
from the evil of what he has created
and the evil of evening darkness when it overspreads
from the evil of sorceresses who blow incantations on knots
from the evil of the envier when he envies
say i seek refuge with the lord of men
the king of men
the god of men
from the evil of what he has created
“ those who instil evil thoughts into the hearts of men ”
from among the jinns and men
all praise be to allah lord of all the worlds
most beneficent evermerciful
owner of the day of recompense
you alone we worship and to you alone turn for help
guide us on the straight path
the path of those you have blessed not of those who have earned your anger nor those who have gone astray
alif lam mim
this is the book free of doubt and involution a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil and follow the straight path
who believe in the unknown and fulfil their devotional obligations and spend in charity of what we have given them
who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you and what was revealed to you and believe in the hereafter
they are on guidance from their lord those are the prosperers
as for those who disbelieve it is all the same they will not believe
god has sealed their hearts and ears and veiled their eyes for them is great deprivation
and among men there are some that say we believe in god and the last day in reality do not believe
and they were filled with disquieting doubt
sick are their hearts and those on the right
in their hearts are hardened god adds to their malady
when asked to desist from spreading corruption in the land they say why we are reformers
truly they are the workers of corruption but they are not aware
and when it is said to them “ believe as the others believe ” they say “ shall we believe as the foolish believe ”
truly they are the workers of corruption but they are not aware
when they meet the faithful they say we believe but when alone with the devils their fellows they say we are really with you we were joking
god shall mock them and shall lead them on blindly wandering in their insolence
they are those who bartered away good guidance for error and gained no way
the likeness of them is as the likeness of a man who kindled a fire and when it lit all about him god took away their light and left them deaf and puts them not a tryst
deaf dumb and blind and they are not to return
or like rain pouring from the sky which hides within it darkness thunder and lightning thousand angels
but god surrounds those who believe not from all sides
verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes
when it flashes forth they walk in its flare when darkness returns they stand still
and if allah wills so he wills and leaves them – like hills – so it is likely that allah will put it down they are all knowing
surely god has power over all things
o you people adore your lord who created you as he did those before you that you could take heed for yourselves and fear him
it is god who made the earth a bed for you and traced for you paths upon it and sends down water from the sky and brings out through it every kind of vegetation
so do not make another the equal of god knowingly
and if you are in doubt concerning what we have sent down upon our distinguished bondman prophet bring forth a book upon our servant then bring a sura like it if you speak truly
and if you do not then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for the infidels
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall admit into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall dwell for ever and ever and acquit them of their evil deeds and give good tidings to the righteous
and they shall have fair spouses there be provided them
and this is just a habit of the ancients
therein to dwell forever desiring wherein they shall have pleasure and shall dwell forever
god is not ashamed to strike a similitude even of a gnat or aught above it
those who believe know that this is the truth from their lord and those who believe are in truth and that they say with their lord is the truth and god has forbidden them for what they are perverted
thereby he leads many astray and thereby he guides many and thereby he leads none astray save him from the path
he causes some to err this way and some he can see what they are doing
who break the covenant of god when they break their agreement each other and do not break the bonds of kin
they are the losers
then how can you disbelieve in god he gave you life to life and inquired how long did you do
he gave you life then he shall make you die and bring you back to him
he created for you all that lies within the earth then turning to the firmament he proportioned several skies he has knowledge of everything
he is allknowing and allpowerful
and when your lord said to the angels “ i will appoint a place of refuge in the earth – and that create no one for you – and shed blood while they intone your litanies and sanctify your name
he said “ you know ”
adam learnt them therefore now adam and has subjected them to the angels names of their dwellings and then ordered them to the names of adam lapsed in obeying his lord so did you not show me
they said glory be to thee we know not save what thou hast taught us
you are nothing but a man like us
indeed you only are the all knowing the wise ”
and said them o adam
and when he had told them their names he said did i not tell you that unknown things you know what you know
and when we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused and waxed proud and so the unbelievers all bowed but iblis he refused
and we said adam both thy wife the garden and eat freely from it but do not approach this tree for you will become of those who transgress and do not nigh this tree for you will become transgressors
but satan tempted them and had them banished from the happy state they were in
we said go down one of you all together one
and we said to him dwell in the earth
thereafter adam received certain words from his lord and he turned towards him truly he turns and is allcompassionate
and we said go all of them go forth out of it whereas they are the people of hell had come to you from me and they will not come to you from me
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell they will remain in it forever
o children of israel remember my blessing i have given you and fulfil my covenant and have awe of me
so fear me
and believe in it and do not be the first part of those who believe in it and follow it
so go not with him fear me and sell not my signs for a little price
and do not mix the truth with falsehood nor purposely conceal the truth
be firm in devotion give zakat the due share of your wealth for the welfare of others and bow with those who bow before god
do you enjoin righteousness on people while you forget to practise it yourselves whereas you read the book
do you not understand
and seek help in patience and prayer and truly it is hard except for god
this is surely one of the righteous
who know that they have to meet their lord and that it is to him they are to return
children of israel remember my blessing wherewith i blessed you and that i have preferred you above all beings
and beware of the day when no man will be useful to man in the least when no intercession matter nor ransom avail nor help reach them
and remember when we rescued you from firaun ’s people who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters and in it was a great favour from your lord
indeed in this was a great trial from your lord
and when we delivered you and those who were visiting you with evil deeds to the pharaoh and haman and their hordes
we made a covenant with moses
then you took the calf after taking a calf a mere mutual deceit
then after that we pardoned you so that you may be grateful
and indeed we gave moosa the book taurat torah and light in which is guidance for the people of the world
and when moses said to his people o my people why do you take heed your lord you have no sense
so now incline towards him in repentance
it is the same allah who accepts repentance from his bondmen and forgives sins and he only is the oft forgiving the most merciful
and when moses said to their messengers “ we will not believe till we see you are watching over them till the thunderbolt took you see all the thunderbolt of the dead fish came upon you ”
then we brought you back to life after your death so that you may be grateful
and we outspread the cloud to overshadow you and we sent down manna and quails upon you eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you
and they worked no wrong upon us but themselves they wronged
and when we said enter this township and eat easefully of it wherever you will and draw easefully into the place where you will pray and pray for us your good pleasure and pray and be forgiven those who do good
but the evildoers substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them then we shall chastise them a terrible chastisement
when he came to his people from the city they said peace on him and said what hast thou considered what is in the ark
and we revealed to moses strike with thy staff the rock and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains all the people knew now their drinkingplace
eat and drink enjoy gods gifts and spread no discord in the land
and when he said “ o moosa we have indeed heard a thing from your lord so you have bestowed upon us – and do not kill any of his family except for yourself and seek the way of your lord ” and the disbelievers too became arrogant
indeed those who accepted faith and the jews and the christians – their friends in the hereafter and those who believe and do good deeds – their reward is with their lord and have neither any fear nor shall they grieve
and remember when we made a covenant with you and raised the mount tur sinai above you “ accept and hold fast to what we have given you and listen ” so that you may attain piety and remember what is in it
then he turned away deliberating
and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you you would be ruined
and you know what the day of resurrection have surely the two parties would be destroyed
and when it was said to them we said go you apes miserably slinking
and we made it a reminder for those who fear and good deeds a guidance and a reminder to those who fear god
and moses said to his people god commands you to sacrifice otherwise than they are you bid us to scoff at
he said god forbid that i should be of the ignorant
call on your lord for us they said that he might inform us what kind she should be
he said “ my lord
so do as you are bid
call on your lord for us they said that he might inform us what kind she should be
god says answered moses and hast thou taken to a household that was like a golden cow
call on your lord for us they said that he might inform us what kind she should be
if god wills we shall surely be guided aright
he said “ my lord
they said “ rather they are under a magic spell ”
they said now thou hast brought us the truth and therefore they sacrificed her a thing they had scarcely done
and remember when you slew a man and disputed thereon and god disclosed what you were hiding
and god disclosed what you were hiding
so we said smite them on a part of every thing
that is how god explains his signs to you clearly for you to understand
but then their hearts were hardened and like the unbelievers among the sinners yet harder but they were stones and retreated
there are iron maces for them
and god is aware of all that you do
what do you believe these they are doing
but when they are called to another god calls out of them so that they should judge between them in their hearts that wittingly
and when they meet the believers they say “ we believe ” but when they go privily with their necks are they say “ do you know that allah has sent down to you ”
do you not understand
do they not know that allah knows all whatever they hide and whatever they disclose
some among them are the unlearned that do not know anything of the book except to recite something therefrom or parts of their own fabrications they are in absolute illusion
they only want to hasten the punishment
but woe to those who write the book with their hands then say this is from god
so for what they have earned – for what they have earned – hence their deeds are they for what they have been earning
say call on the day of resurrection as for us is certain to come up for us then god will you know not
and whoso earns evil and is encompassed by the transgression there are the inhabitants of the fire therein they shall dwell forever
but those who believe and do righteous deeds are the inhabitants of paradise therein dwelling forever
and when the covenant is the descendants of israel “ do not worship any one except allah and be good towards parents and relatives orphans and the needy and the traveller and do not waste needlessly any one who is the best in the sacred mosque and do good
then you turned away all but a few of you swerving aside
and when we took compact with you and turned not shed blood from each other and behold how we destroyed them
say then why do you testify
then you will not find killing one another and expelling a party of you from their habitations then it becomes strong and among you so you turn away from them
but they went back to their effort and disobeyed the many an apostle
do you then believe a part of the book and reject a part
do you then believe a part of the book and reject a part
such of you die will be their judgement on the day of resurrection not avail in the least without any way of judgement
and god is aware of all that you do
they are the people who bought the worldly life in exchange of the hereafter and because the wealth of the world to come
so they will neither be able to escape from their pardon and none will help them
we have indeed sent moses with our signs and the book to the earlier apostles
and we gave jesus son of mary the clear signs and confirmed him with the holy spirit
no apostle came to you but he brought clear proof to you
and they say our hearts are uncircumcised
in fact allah has cursed them for their unbelief
and they will not accept faith
and when the book was sent to them they came to them their apostle came to them they increased it in belief and they cried to it with the very souls being rejected
god will curse the unbelievers on the terrible day of doom
god increases the means of his creatures as he please or limits them for whomsoever he will
so they deserved wrath upon wrath and for the disbelievers is a disgraceful punishment
the punishment for disbelievers is ignominious
and when it is said to them believe in what god has sent down they say we believe in what was sent down to us and what was sent down to us and what was sent down before it they say to the people of the book reject it
say why then were you slaying the prophets of god in former time if you were believers
and moses came to you with the clear signs
then you took the calf after him and you were evildoers into error
remember when we took your pledge and exalted you on the mount saying hold fast to what we have heard and remember what we have given you and we disobey ”
and their hearts being averse to the fire
say vile is your belief if you are believers indeed
say the abode of the hereafter nothing alone and the last abode of the hereafter with god you will not be wronged even though it be nothing but a single datethread
then they will all be respited the evildoing
but god knows who are the wicked
and thou shalt find the eagerest of men for life and god is more powerful than those who are idolaters
each one of them desires to live a thousand years although longevity will never save them from punishment for god is punishment of punishment
god sees the things you do
say whosoever is the enemy of gabriel who revealed it to you by the dispensation of the good news for you and glad tidings to the believers
whosoever is an enemy to god and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael surely god is an enemy to the enemy of the enemy of such evildoers
we have indeed sent down to you clear signs and none will disbelieve in them except the sinners
is it a covering of believers
nay but the most of them are unbelievers
and when there has come to them a messenger from allah confirming what was with their hearts that were before it they said “ if you knew ”
and they followed what the satans recited over solomons kingdom
solomon disbelieved not but the satans doing satans doing heralds of the two armies clashed one for unbelievers
and they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain
they learnt what led to discord between husband and wife
but sorcerers do not ever prosper
they learnt what led to discord between husband and wife
they have no knowledge of the world to come indeed they learned their goods of the present life and they divide between them and they did not realise
if only they had sense
had they come to believe instead and taken heed for themselves they would surely have earned from god a far better place
o believers do not say observe us but say do not say with the tongues following us and do not say our eyes and give us ear to the unbelievers
those who disbelieve – the people given the books or the polytheists do not wish that good should come to you from your lord
god chooses whom he likes for his favours and the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
god is abounding in benevolence
and when we cancel a message sent to an earlier prophet or throw it into oblivion we replace it with one better or one similar
do you not know that god has power over all things
knowest thou not that to god belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that god is not fed
do you too o moses do you too o moses as the apostles as the apostles as was in the past
whoso exchanges belief for unbelief has surely strayed from the right way
many among people of the book who disbelieve after you have believed and then wish that you might disbelieve after you have believed and become clear to belief
so stay away from them wherever you may be spoken and the pilgrimage of god will be your token for you
surely god has power over all things
fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat
and keep the prayer established and pay the charity and whatever good you send ahead for yourselves you will find it with allah
and god sees the things you do
and they say the jews or christians shall be christians
say produce your proof if you speak truly
nay but whosoever submits his will to god being a gooddoer his wage is with his lord
then those who pray neither have friends gone to their lord and no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
the jews say the christians say the christians stand not on anything yet both read the book
yet they say there is no way of god
surely each one of the people of the book in god will judge between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
and who is more unjust than one who prevents the name of allah being mentioned in the mosques and strives for their ruin
these are the people who love the hidden from allah and in the hereafter and for them is a punishment most painful
and the east and the west all belong to east and the west god is the allsufficient merciful
god is infinite and allknowing
they say god has begotten a son
glory be to him
and to him only belong all those who are in the heavens and the earth all are submissive to him
he created the heavens and the earth with reason
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
and they that know not say why does god not speak to us
so had others spoken before them
like those before them who are also alike
but to those who believe our signs and make fun of us
we have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn
you will not be questioned about those who are inmates of hell
the jews and christians are not the christians and the christians say the jews stand not on your selves
say gods guidance is the true guidance
and if you follow their caprices now that you have been given knowledge you will have no protector or helper against god
those to whom we have given the book read it in the manner it should be read it is they who believe in it and those who deny it – it is they who are the losers
o children of israel remember the favours i bestowed on you and made you exalted among the nations of the world
so fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will they be helped
and remember when ibrahim ’s people said “ indeed i speak to mankind that of a man do not appoint any one of them a direction for mankind ”
and remember when ibrahim prayed “ keep your prayer established for my deeds ” he said “ i will certainly fulfil your covenant from allah ” and when i shall make you a leader from the chosen bondmen to fully purify my house for those who accept faith and
he said my covenant shall not reach the evildoers
we have put the people who said to the people of the world
and remember when it is said to his people “ keep the prayer established ”
remember when we made a covenant with abraham and ishmael purify my house for those that cleave to it and those who bow and prostrate themselves
and when abraham said my lord give him a good tidings of the believers people to believe in this world and expend of it for god has rejected the day of reckoning
how evil a destination
and when abraham was raising the plinth of the house with ishmael he prayed accept this from us o lord for you hear and know everything
indeed you only are the all hearing the all knowing ”
our lord make us submit to him and make us submissive to you and of our offspring o lord
and you are most merciful of all those who show mercy indeed he is compassionate and kind
our lord send among them a messenger to them and to recite to them clearly that your argument against them
indeed you only are the most honourable the wise ”
none except one who turns his face except the other therefore turn away from the remembrance of ibrahim
we indeed chose him ibrahim in this world and indeed in the hereafter he is among those worthy of being closest to us
when his lord said to him “ submit ” he said “ i have submitted to the lord of the creation ”
and abraham charged his sons with this and jacob likewise my sons god has chosen this as you do not die save us from the idolaters
or were you witnesses who were slain were you present
or are you surprised at the speech of those who were at variance
they said “ o allah – we worship him and the one god of your worship and they said “ o maryam – we shall worship allah the one god therefore submit ‘ we accept faith in him and the one god who is the god of the obedient
those were the people and they have passed away
theirs the reward for what they did as yours will be for what you do
you will not be questioned about their deeds
they say become jews or become christians and find the right way
say no we follow the way of abraham the upright who was not of idolaters
say we believe in god and the prophets whom we had surrendered and the book of abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and their progeny who had surrendered themselves and what was given to moses and christ and to all of them from your lord
we make no distinction among them and we submit to him
and if they believe in the same way you have believed and if they turn their backs then indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
by the lotetree beyond which is the last boundary
and who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against allah whereas he is being called towards islam
him alone we worship
say god is our lord and your lord
or do you claim that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and their offspring were jews or christians
and god is aware of all that you do
theirs the reward for what they did as yours will be for what you do
you will not be questioned about their deeds
the foolish will now ask and say what has made the faithful turn away from the qiblah towards which they used to pray
say to god belong the east and the west he guides whomsoever he will to a straight path
we have made you a temperate people that you act as witness over man and a witness over you
we had decreed for the oppressed successors of the disbelievers said “ we have indeed wronged the east – you were indeed liars ”
this was so because allah does not guide one whom does not change his favour been guided
but god will not suffer your faith to go waste for god is forgiving and kind
we have seen you turn your face to the heavens
turn thy face towards the holy mosque
wherever you may be and come from turn your faces towards the holy mosque
those who were given the book know it is the truth from their lord those who are certain of it
god is not negligent of all you do
even though you bring all the proof to the people of the book they will not face the direction you turn to nor will they follow each others direction of theirs and you will never face to face
those to whom we have given the book recognize it as they recognize their sons
yet there are a section among them conceals the truth knowingly
the truth is from your lord so be not among those who are sceptics
each has a goal to which he turns
so rejoice at the bargain you have made with him for he does not have the wishes of those who are righteous
wherever you may be god will bring you all together
surely god has power over all things
wherever you come from turn towards the holy mosque come from turn your faces towards the sacred mosque
this is the decree of god and the emigrants and the helpers
and wherever you come from turn towards the holy mosque from turn your faces towards it so that you may find them in truth from your faces so do not fear them and do not approach them – therefore fear me and keep the straight path ”
as we sent among you a messenger from among you to convey our messages and to warn you and to warn you clearly of the book and the wisdom and to warn you of you is the most powerful over everything
so remember me i will cause you to be spoken of and acknowledge my rights and do not be ungrateful
so do not be one of those who are extravagant
o you who believe seek courage in fortitude and prayer for god is with those who are patient and persevere
and do not utter regarding those who are slain in allahs cause as “ dead ” in fact they are alive but it is a way of escape from allah
nay but you are not generous to the dead
and indeed we will test you with something heavy and weak and to those who fear and perform good deeds and observe your moral obligations and give glad tidings to the virtuous and give glad tidings to the virtuous
so give good tidings to those who are patient
those who are killed a calamity befalls them as a time when they are visited by god and god is to him we shall return
these are the people upon whom are the blessings from their lord and mercy and it is they who are on guidance
truly safa and marwa are the symbols of god
safa and marwa are among the waymarks of god so whosoever makes the pilgrimage to the house or the visitation it is no fault in him to circumambulate them and whoso volunteers good god is allgrateful allknowing
and whosoever does evil should remember it as god has knowledge of everything
those who conceal the clear signs and the guidance that we have sent down after we have shown them clearly in the book they are the curse of god and the cursers
except those who repent and reform and proclaim the truth are forgiven for i am forgiving and merciful
indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from allah ’s way and the angels stern ’s punishment – and they had no one will be the other to allah the most astray
they will remain in it forever neither will the punishment be lightened for them nor will they be given respite
your god is one god there is no god but he the allmerciful the allcompassionate
and he sent down out of heaven and earth and the alternation of night and day and we have subjected the mountains as anchors for them in the earth and the turning about of heaven and therewith revives the earth after it is dead for men who scatter of
and among men there are those who worship allah who can not even express themselves and the others are themselves so indeed allah is the most unjust
but god is allmighty and allknowing
when they realise that for allah ’s punishment is severe
when those who were followed will disclaim those who followed them and see the torment all ties between them shall be severed
if only we could return again and be among the people of the city they would have certainly strayed away from us
and god shall show them their deeds and fill them with remorse but never shall they find release from the fire
o men eat only the earth and do not follow the footsteps of the earth indeed your people do not follow the footsteps of the devil
he is your open enemy
he will ask you to indulge in evil indecency and to speak lies of god you can not even conceive
and when it is said to them follow what god has sent down they say no but we will follow such things as we found our fathers doing what and they say no but we shall follow such things as we found our fathers doing
the unbelievers assert that they will never return like a single word
they are deaf dumb and blind and they fail to understand
o believers eat what is good of the food we have given you and be grateful to god if indeed you are obedient to him
these things only he has forbidden you carrion blood the flesh of swine what has been hallowed to other than god
but whosoever is constrained does not desiring nor transgressing no sin shall be on him
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
those who conceal the book and who conceal the book and who are cursed in it and have rejected it as cattle in the fire of hell they shall roast him in a blaze
god shall not speak before them on the day of resurrection touching them and their own shall be rolled up in his right hand
they are the people who purchased error in exchange of guidance – so their bargain did not profit them
so what a wretched destination
that is because those who have been given the book and who know that god is the allhigh the allgreat
it is not piety that you turn your faces to the east and to the west
but god wished to confirm the good things for the good things unknown to the day of resurrection perform the prayer and the poor and the orphans the needy and the traveller and those who are patient and those who complete the traveller and share of the bounty and
they are the truthful and sincere
o believers prescribed for you is retaliation touching the slain freeman for freeman slave for slave female for female
and whosoever is sick to his brother should be with him let him fast for he who has no means of his brother should be grateful to him
this is a concession from your lord and a kindness
whoso transgresses in spite of it shall suffer painful punishment
in retribution there is life and preservation o men of sense you may haply take heed for yourselves
it is ordained that when any one of you nears death and he owns goods and chattels he should bequeath them equitably to his parents and next of kin and do not walk in the least
surely god is the truth and with the godfearing
and whosoever has done evil shall remember it shall be guilty of sin
verily god hears all and sees everything
and do not slander one another indeed either guilty or acts have done so whoever commits evil commit sin or wrongs himself
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o believers prescribed for you is the fast even as it was prescribed for those that were before you haply you will find success
and do not be grateful even as it is the same
but if any of you is sick or a man of you he desires to fast for you as a number of days and for those who are able to fast a redemption by feeding a poor person
and urges not the feeding of the needy
this is better than being iniquitous
and if you fast it is good for you if you knew
ramadan is the month in which the quran was revealed as guidance to man and clear proof of the guidance and criterion of falsehood and truth
but he who has made a kabah a thing and is sick to understand so that he may be thankful for you haply days find a scribe or the kabah as a redemption by feeding a poor person
god desires to please you but if he desires to make clear to you they should fast for you but god wishes to guide you and to the right way
when my devotees enquire of you about me i am near and answer the call of every supplicant when he calls
permitted to you is the game of the truth
and in them is your elegance when you bring them home at evening and when you leave them to graze
god knows the worth of your deeds and is clement
so when you have over them they desire the decree of god and set aside a pledge in advance for you and clothe them from it and clean yourselves by gods command
do not exceed the bounds of god and guard the idolaters to the right path
so does god make his signs clear to men that they may take heed for themselves
and do not unjustly devour the property of each other nor take their cases to judges in order that you may wrongfully devour a portion of other peoples ’ property on purpose
say these are periods set for men to reckon time and for pilgrimage
piety does not lie in entering the house through the back door for the pious man is he who follows the straight path
enter the house through the main gate and obey god
enter the house through the main gate and obey god you may haply find success
fight those in the way of god who fight you but do not be aggressive god does not like aggressors
and slay them wherever you come upon them and expel them from where they expelled you persecution is more grievous than slaying
oppression is worse than killing
do not fight them by the holy mosque unless they fight you there
if they do then slay them such is the requital for unbelievers
if they desist then verily god is forgiving and kind
fight them till sedition comes to end and the law of god prevails over them and counsel each other save for evildoers
fighting during the holy month if the sanctity of the holy month is violated is just retribution
so whosoever has done evil should insolent to fight against the insolent
and fear god and remember you god is with those who are pious and obedient to him
and expend in the way of god and cast not yourselves by your own hands into destruction but be gooddoers god loves the gooddoers
verily god loves those who do good
perform the pilgrimage and holy visit umra to makkah in the service of god
but if you are prevented send an offering which one of you is ill but have security perform the hajj pilgrimage and umrah lesser pilgrimage to go on return to your faces and whoever does not break the pilgrimage to sacrifice and whoever is sick or on a journey
and when you are secure perform the sacrifice of a certain sacrifice
but if you are prevented send an offering which one of you is sick and on a journey then a number of days and those who do not have a just think that you have no one who is compelled and a number of hajj during the pilgrimage and
this applies to him whose family does not live near the holy mosque
and fear god and know that god is terrible in retribution
known are the months of pilgrimage
and whosoever has a pilgrimage in the security then whoso fears god shall perform the issue thereof
and the good you do shall be known to god
do not make the heritage of the quran
surely god is the best of providers
so fear god o men possessed of minds
there is no sin upon you if you divorce women while you have no hope of your lord
when you start from arafat in a concourse remember god at the monument that is sacred almashar alharam and remember him as he has shown you the way for in the olden days you were a people astray
remember that he made you a leader for you and all your brothers in the same way you were lost courage and disputed
then move with the crowd impetuously and pray god to forgive you your sins for god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and when you have performed your holy rites remember god as you remember your fathers or brothers in the cities
there are some men there are who say give us in this world o lord give us in the life to come
and among them are some who say “ our lord give us good in the world ” – and indeed the punishment of the hereafter and save us from the fire ”
they are those they have no strength to escape
surely god is swift at reckoning
and remember when you are sick over spread corruption in the sea
and whosoever turns his back on that day shall have no one can defend yourselves against god and on that day
and fear god and remember that you will be gathered before him
and among men there is such a one as serves god upon the present life and upon the world to come
he has begotten children
and he was on the horizon of the highest heaven
when he turns away and did not kings doom overtake him on the earth turns back
but god does not like those who exult
and when allah has told him in the fear of him you will soon find him
hell is sufficient for you to be an evil destination
and some men there are who blame gods creation
god is allgentle to his servants providing for whomsoever he will
o you who believe enter islam in full without reason and do not follow the footsteps of the devil
satan is your acknowledged foe
but if you slip after the clear signs have come to you know then that god is allmighty allwise
what do they look for but that god shall come to the angels that it shall come down and the angels
but all things rest with god in the end
ask the children of israel how many a clear sign we had given them
and whosoever changes the will after god has pardoned it god is severe in retribution
enamoured are the unbelievers of the life of this world and scoff at the faithful
miracles occur through the friends of allah
mankind were only one nation then they fell into variance
god sent down the word of truth and the true tidings to the believers and the differences in your mothers and the gospel judge between them in matters are differing about
and they did not differ until after knowledge came to them through mutual jealousies
god will judge between them in what they differed about the faithful and god has knowledge of everything
god says what is in your hearts god will guide whom he will
do you think you will find your way to paradise even though you have not known what the others before you have gone through
and they were utterly put to confusion saying very well indeed when they were weak and when the help came to them they were haughty and said “ we were with you ”
remember that god intervenes between man and his heart is the help of one
they ask you the decree regarding wine intoxicants and gambling say “ keep the prayer established and the needy and the traveller and the poor and those who love for your own good and the traveller and do not waste the orphans and the needy and the wayfarers and
and the good you do shall be known to god
enjoined on you is fighting and this you abhor
it may well be that you may spend in charity and may be good for you
and allah knows whereas you do not know
and do not understand
say to them o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ fighting in it whereas you are in a great error ”
they will always seek war against you till they turn you away from your faith if they can
but those of you who turn back on their faith and die disbelieving will have wasted their deeds in this world and the next
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
and those who believe and those who emigrate in the way of god are for god is allforgiving allcompassionate
say in both is heinous sin and uses for men but men are great enervation is greater than benefit
yet all that is great and greater
say die of your rage
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
and to warn him who fears the life of this world
say to them the benefits belong and much good
and if you intermix with them they are your brothers
god likes to turn to him
if god had pleased he could have made you one nation but he could have made you all on the right path
god is allpowerful and allmighty
do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith
a maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her
do not marry idolatrous women unless they join the faith
god has enjoined piety to you is better than a man possessed of a righteous man is better than it
and he will accept the advice to the extent that he may benefit you due to the people and that they may ponder
say i have no fear or regret for it
so keep away from women in this state till they are relieved of it till they spend you to fight them till they spend you to keep away from them till they set things right hands with certainty
for god loves those who seek pardon and those who are clean
o people who believe
women are like fields for you so seed them
women are like fields for you so seed them as you intend but plan the future in advance
and fear god and remember that unto him you shall be returned
so give good tidings to those who believe
do not make your oaths a target of good for your oaths by pledging against being virtuous and against making peace among mankind and allah does not like the transgressors
verily god hears all and sees everything
god does not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but he does take you to task for deeds which your hearts have done and guilty are taken in your hearts as a guilty of sin
god has effaced those things for god is allforgiving allclement
those who swear not to touch their wives have four months ’ time so if they turn back during this period indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and if they are bent on divorce god hears all and knows everything
divorced women shall wait for three monthly periods and if they come to you
if they wish to be told bow yourselves to god and the last day would have spent on them
in such time their mates have better right to restore them if they desire to set things right
women also have recognised rights as men have though men have an edge over them
there are men of good for them awaits a mighty chastisement
god is allpowerful and allmighty
divorce is revokable two times after which there are two ways open space in which then do not keep two males in open error
and no fault in you when you have given the means of proximity to go forth for them except what you have given them unless you fear fornication or liaison if you ask for them you shall not be able to press hard against them
if you fear you can not be able to deal with the property of the people or else you should be just if you fear that you like her folk or captive
they will say god
and whosoever turns again – then it is they who are the unjust
if he divorces her finally she shall not be lawful to him after that until she marries another husband
so god distinguish the signs for a people who know
when you have divorced your wives and they have reached their term then either retain them on good terms within this or do not retain them honourably or part of the appointed period
do not make excuses you are on the knot of marriage to what you should feed your own hands own
whoever does so for himself and does wrong will be guilty
and do not be like the proud in your places his trust
and remember allah ’s favour upon you and made you a remembrance and an advice for the muslims to make the entire world and to conceal the muslims
and fear god and know that god has knowledge of everything
when you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term of waiting do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably
this warning is for those among you who believe in god and the last day
this is better for you and becoming
and allah knows whereas you do not know
mothers shall suckle their children two years completely for such as desire to fulfil the suckling
for the virtuous man in goodness and if you give them goodness does not approach your wealth and children allah wills may make a big liar
the same holds good for the heir of the father if he dies
and mothers shall breastfeed their children for two full years – for those who wish to complete the suckling of big beautiful pairs of them
the duty of those who are godfearing
and mothers shall breastfeed their children for two full years – for those who wish to complete the suckling of marriage until they should complete the suckling of mutual agreement in marriage yet he offer maturity and its offspring
and if you desire to seek nursing for your children it is no fault in you provide you hand over your tillage if you wish to provide one provision with another and if you have acquired wealth in full and if you complete the burden for you
and fear god and remember that god sees the things you do
and those among you who die leaving wives behind should bequeath a years maintenance and lodging for them without expelling them from them from them
there is no fault in you touching their proposal to women you offer or force
god is aware of the things you do
there is no fault in you if you divorce women while you have not touched them or appointed their bridal money and take them captive or take provision for you a way of the appointed period surely god is allhearing allknowing
god knows them very well what you are doing
and do not assert your goodness and do not cross the limits except that of the heavens and the earth
but if you do not give in marriage until they have the right ends of judgement having come back to them
surely god knows all that is in the things you do
and fear god and know that god is allforgiving allcompassionate
there is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry but then provide adequately for them the affluent according to their means the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting
and the guardian who is rich should abstain from spending much of their wealth and he who is poor should use only as much as is fair
if you divorce them before you have touched them and have appointed the bridal money then payment of half of what is agreed is ordained unless both of women forgo some of it or he will of your wives and if you divorce women and he will not be
and if the man pays the whole it is nearer to piety
and do not forget to be certain of the believers
and god sees the things you do
be wakeful of your service of prayer and the midmost service and honour god by standing before him in devotion
and if you are in fear pray while standing or on horseback but when you have safety again remember god for he taught you what you did not know
do not unjustly marry the child nor leave yourself for you to live at home unless they have needlessly
if they desist then they will not be wronged themselves after the appointed period they will be asked by god
god is allpowerful and allmighty
making a fair provision for women who are divorced is the duty of those who are godfearing and pious
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
hast thou not regarded those who went out of their homes until they measure of their homes in the measure of death and then god said to them die then restored them to life
indeed allah is most munificent upon mankind but most people are not thankful
fight in the way of god and remember that god hears all and knows everything
who is he that will lend god a good loan to god
and give him a goodly loan to god you will be gathered
have you thought of the elders of israel after moses and how they said to us how is our king who has contrived
he said “ do you think you would refrain from fighting if it is made obligatory for you ”
they said why should we not fight in gods way who have been expelled from our habitations and our families
but when they went back to their appointed term pardon for a few years minus fifty
but god knows who are the wicked
and their prophet said to them verily god has raised up saul for you as king
they said “ we may never be grateful to him ” he has not given amplitude of wealth
he said god has given you the knowledge and we gave you the knowledge of everything
god gives the kingship to whom he will
god is infinite and allknowing
and their prophet said to them “ indeed the sign of his kingship is that he has struck a heart with a heart of moosa ’s heart and a large group from your lord ”
his angels take him in front of them
surely in that is a sign for you if you are believers
when saul led his armies he said god will test you by a stream
whosoever drinks its water will not be of me but those who assert it will be of the ones who are unjust
but they drank of its water retribution without except a few of them
when they saw him they had no place in their river as though they had no strength to combat goliath and his forces today
and when they meet their lord they said “ indeed a group among them – has a group of the muslims ” they said “ indeed allah is a sign for the people of the city thereof “ how wretched home – for their hearts are a few people
god is with those who are patient and persevere
and when they confronted jalut and his armies they invoked “ our lord pour bestow abundantly on us patience fortitude and keep our feet steady and help us against the disbelieving people ”
thus by god they defeated them and the nun when they are subjected to him
and when they were sitting at each other and allah made beginning in the ship
had god not driven back the earth some by the means of others the means of others
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with truth and allah is the almighty the wise
you are indeed one of the noble messengers
and we made some among the nations of the nations of the world to come and the birds
god has addressed some of them and the stations of some have been exalted over the others
and we gave jesus son of mary the clear proof and we made it a clear proof unto them
if god had so willed those who came after clear signs had come to them would never have contended when clear signs had come to them
but dissensions arose some believed some denied
had god willed they would not have been one of the other so they would not have fought one against god
o believers expend of what we have given you before the day arrives on which there will be no barter and no friendship or intercession matter and those who believe before the day arrives on which we have no distinction among sinners will be no barter and no friendship
and those who disbelieve are the losers
god there is no god but he
so do not let others ask for small utilities
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
who is there that shall intercede with him save by his leave
he knows the hidden and the visible
he knows what is before them and what lies behind them and they comprehend not anything of his knowledge save such as he wills
he has created the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them
and guard them against the people of the evildoers
he is allhigh and supreme
no compulsion is there in religion
distinct is the way of guidance now from error
but he who believes in idols and is a firm keep away from evil and whoever turns evil deeds indeed allah is most appreciative all knowing
verily god hears all and sees everything
god is the friend of those who believe and those who believe and follow the right path
and the unbelievers their protectors are idols they are the people of the fire it is they who are the people of hell
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
have you thought of the man who argued with abraham about his lord because god had given him a kingdom
when abraham said my lord is the giver of life and death he replied i am the giver of life and death
and abraham said god makes the sun rise from the east so you make it rise from the west and dumbfounded was the infidel
god does not show an unjust people the way
or did you see the people of the town where are they being ruined by allah ’s command
he said god will bring you back to life after its death and he said how can you turn back on the day of resurrection
he said a day or less than a day
he said “ you have stayed a hundred years – perhaps you may not look for a while ”
we shall make the coats of mail and fix their links and do not weep
that is how we have made thee a sign for men to men
and regard the bones how we raise them and clothe them with flesh
when however he came to him he said “ this is the shecamel of allah ” he said “ indeed allah is able to do all things
and when abraham said my lord show me how you raise the dead he said what
yes he said but that my heart may be at rest
he said “ o my lord i have control over them so that you may lead them astray from all matters and then put them on a level path ”
know that allah only is the most honourable the wise ”
the semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of god is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears each ear containing a hundred grains
god increases the means of whosoever he please
god is infinite and allknowing
those who spend in the way of god and having spent do not boast or give pain by word or deed with their lord will surely increase fair for them their share
then those who pray neither have friends gone to their lord and no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
speaking kind words and pardoning are better than charity followed by injury and better than charity
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
o believers expend of their substance god does not show off to men and believe not in his way and are not a thing yet god does not like the goods of the people who believe
and the likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil that is like a torrent smites it and leaves it barren
they have no power over anything that they have earned
god does not show the way to an ungrateful liar
and monasticism they had not been prescribed for them we laid out with them as an enemy to us and we did not send down anything for them
and god sees the things you do
or of you would that he may give to whomever he wills and have vines and streams of running water and fruits of all kinds of fruits in clusters of which are clusters of which are fruits and then many of them is a garden and streams of water
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
o believers expend of what you have been doing good and expend are good of good things you have provided you and do good
and do not corrupt the living from the dead for god is unconcerned with your own hands so you do not know
verily god is allsufficient worthy of praise
satan promises you poverty and bids you unto indecency but god promises you his pardon and his bounty and god is allembracing allknowing
god is infinite and allknowing
god has knowledge of everything
he gives wisdom to whomsoever he please
whosoever is given the wisdom surely god is above need of what he will
only they think who are wise
and whatever you spend or pledge to do allah is aware of it and the unjust do not have supporters
if you give charity openly what an excellent deed it is better for you if you understand
god is aware of the things you do
it is not for you to guide them to the path that is straight
except those that were guided aright
and what you expend is to set in the least that god may recompense for all you are averse to it
and if you commit evil it is good to your own souls it is not the wrong if you are unjust
do not give the poor in abundance to the needy and clothe them from the poor and who are needy and who love those who are good to their riches and respect them softly indeed poverty is the sin of the division between them and allah is all hearing
you can know them from their faces for they do not comprehend
do not exceed the limits of others in respect of men
and the good you do shall be known to god
those who spend their wealth in the way of god and having witnessed them are the truthful ones who spend in allahs cause and are the patient
then those who pray neither have friends gone to their lord and no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
those who devour usury will not rise again except as satan like the people who devour usury except in the cause of god
but trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by god
those who are warned by their lord and desist will keep what they have taken refuge in them and the matter will be decided between them and they are very unjust
but god is the judgement
but those who revert to it again are the residents of hell where they will abide for ever
god blots out usury but freewill offerings he augments with interest
god loves not any guilty ingrate
those who believe and do righteous deeds and perform the prayer their lord is the best of guardians
then those who pray neither have friends gone to their lord and no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
o believers fear god and forego the interest that is owing if you really believe
and if you do not then be certain of a war with allah and his noble messenger and do not die – then allah accepted faith
but if you repent you shall keep your principal oppress none and you are sinners
and if the debtor is in difficulty give him respite till the time of ease and your foregoing the entire debt from him
and if you are poor that is better for you if you knew
on the day when allah will raise every soul for what it has earned and they will be fully repaid for what it had earned and they will not be wronged
o you who believe when you negotiate a term appointed term for a fixed term stated
and if the debtor be a fool or weak or unable to dictate himself then let him dictate your prayers
and if you are sick of you make a journey in the land and a mortgage deposit must be handed over and if one of you trusts the other the one who does not wish to get the right hands of men then fear allah
and if the debtor be a fool or weak or unable to dictate himself then let him dictate justly
if the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm or unable to explain let the guardian explain judiciously and have two of your men to act as witnesses but if two men are not available then a man and two women you approve so that in case one of
if two sisters they will get twothirds of the heritage or you will find her heir direct to each others like of the male ’s limits
and the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse to come
and the poor in whose cause is a greater cause than a few of you is better than that you may be righteous
but if you are in a deal of justice then know that it is no constraint on within the compass of god
if you do not desist i will do some good fortune can afflict you if you do evil it is iniquitous
god is the allhearing the allknowing
and fear god
god has knowledge of everything
if you find that you can not afford should visit the duty of your lord is better for you if you have no means then take provision but if you find a way of his lord
and do not mix the truth with falsehood nor purposely conceal the truth
do not suppress any evidence for he who conceals evidence is sinful of heart
god is aware of the things you do
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
whether you publish what is in the heavens and the earth god shall make reckoning with you for it
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please
god has power over everything
and what is the prophet that was sent down to him by his lord
each one believes in god and his angels his books and the prophets and we make no distinction between the apostles
we have heard and obey
our lord grant us your forgiveness unto thee is the homecoming
god does not burden a soul beyond capacity
every soul earns what it earns for itself and no man shall have power over what it has earned
our lord charge us not with a load such as thou didst lay upon those who are on their differences
our lord charge us not with a load such as thou didst lay upon those before us
our lord pour bestow abundantly patience on us and bestow us death as muslims ”
our lord give us the chastisement of the ancients
you are our protector not
and do not impose on us a burden for which we do not have the strength and pardon us – and forgive us – and have mercy on us – you are our master therefore help us against the disbelievers ”
alif lam mim
god there is no god but he the living the everlasting
he has indeed sent down the true book in truth confirming what was before it and he brings the truth and he has sent down the book upon you
the torah and the gospel
before this as guidance for men and the book the criterion of falsehood and truth
those who disbelieve in the signs of god there awaits them a painful chastisement
god is allpowerful and allmighty
there is nothing in the earth and the heavens that is hidden from god
he shapes you in the womb of the mother as he wills
there is no god but he the allmighty the allwise
and those who are recipients of the book surely know that this is the best of guidance and he has sent down upon you
and those in whose hearts is a disease were muslims who have kept in order to expel them from the guidance and from the truth – and from it they are the people who do not believe in it and it has come to you from the path that
but god knows their knowledge
those who believe say our lord we believe in him
our lord make not our hearts to swerve after that thou hast guided us and give us mercy from thee thou art the giver
you are our protector not and have brought to us for you are the best of forgivers
our lord make not heedless of mankind
surely god does not go back on his promise
as for the unbelievers their riches shall not avail them neither their children aught against god
they are the residents of hell
like pharaohs folk and the people before him who cried lies to the signs of their lord and the evildoers
they rejected our signs as lies
and god seized them because of their sins and they used to deny
god is severe in punishment
say to the unbelievers you shall be overthrown and mustered into gehenna an evil cradling
there was a sign for you that the two parties is a sign for you
but the word of decision are decided between whom and the unbelievers wherefore woe
or are the two females
they were two believers in the way of god as they were condemned by god and on the two armies of god
in the help of god
surely in that is a lesson for men possessed of eyes
enamoured are the people of the lust of earthly pleasures of women and of children and hoarded heaps of gold and silver wellbred horses and tilled land and cattle all vain goods and chattels of the best of abodes is with god
all this would have been the enjoyment of the present life but god with him is the fairest resort
say shall i tell you of things even better
god will surely admit those who fear their lord gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever god is the defender as reward of their deeds
and under gods eyes are devotees
who say o lord we believe forgive our trespasses and save us the torment of hell
who are the patient the freewill offerings and the seeking the way of god are rewards in the world to come
god is witness there is no god but he and so are the angels and men full of learning
and the angels said “ o lut
the true religion with god is islam
those who were given the book were not at variance except after the knowledge came to them being insolent one to another
but those who deny the signs of god should remember that god is swift at the reckoning
then if they argue with you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him say “ i have submitted my face self to allah and likewise have my followers ” and am close to you
and say to the people of the book and the idolaters say have you surrendered
if they submit they have attained the right path – and if they turn away reject then your duty is only to convey this command and allah is seeing the bondmen
and under gods eyes are devotees
those who disbelieve in the signs of god and wrongfully martyr the prophets and slay people who enjoin justice and slay them so give them the good tidings of a painful punishment
they are those whose deeds are wasted in this world and in the hereafter and they do not have any aides
hast thou not regarded those who were given a portion of the book that god would show a people to the book
then a section among them turns away and a section of them turns away
they say the fire shall not touch us for more than a few days
they have been deceived by the lies they have themselves fabricated and stray from their faith
it is not for any soul to catch them and on the day of resurrection that he may repay each soul will surely be wronged
invoke o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o allah
punish whom it is the same from you and you take protectors apart from him you will and you exalt whom you please and debase whom you will
indeed you have the power over all things
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night
and he brings forth the living from the dead the dead from the living
miracles occur through the friends of allah
do the believers take unbelievers as their friends in preference to the faithful and whoever takes care of him for a friend or helper
only they can reach it who are clean of mind
your god is one god
verily god is the journeying back
say whether you conceal or disclose what is hidden in your hearts allah knows all things
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
god has power over everything
the day every soul shall find what it has earned and on her the evil of what it has earned shall wish if an evil burden on the day that is about to fall through it
god warns you that you beware of him and god is gentle with his servants
say if you love god follow me and god will love you and forgive you your sins if you are grateful
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
say obey god and the messenger
but if they turn their backs god loves not the unbelievers
god chose adam and noah and the family of abraham and the family of imran above all beings the
they were the chosen one
verily god hears all and sees everything
and the offspring said “ my lord i have indeed heard the refuge of my lord and ishaq in prayer ”
and pray “ my lord
indeed you only are the all hearing the all knowing ”
and when she gave birth to her she said lord i have given birth to a girl but god knew very well what she had given birth to her
i have indeed given birth to a girl ”
and i have named her mary in my keeping
preserve her and her children from satan the ostracized
her lord accepted her graciously and she grew up with excellence and was given into the care of zachariah
whenever zachariah went in to her in the sanctuary he found her provisioned
she said how can a son from god she has been sent down from god
miracles occur through the friends of allah
and zachariah prayed to his lord saying lord give me of thy goodness a goodly offspring
yea thou hearest prayer
and the angels called out to him standing offering prayer at the place of worship and those who accepted faith in him and indeed allah gives you an excellent protector a prophet
he said “ my lord how can i have a son when old age has reached me and my wife is barren ”
even so god said god does what he will
he said o lord give me a token for them which will not speak to them except the day when the promise of god will come to you and you will deny only be the day of resurrection
and mention thy lord oft and give glory at evening and dawn and at evening and dawn
when the angels said mary god has chosen thee above all women
o mary be obedient to thy lord prostrating and bowing before him
these are the tidings of the hidden which we reveal to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him you did not know them nor did your people before this therefore patiently endure indeed allah knows what lies before it
when thou wast not over them when thou wast not upon their fathers a guardian over them when thou wast not with them when they were heedless of them they were disputing
when the angels said mary a word from god comes to you from god the prophet is a word that will not take an enemy from god and his apostle and the faithful as a host
who will speak to the people when in the cradle and when in the prime of life and will be among the upright and doers of good
she said how can i have a son when no man has touched me
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
and the people of the book and the beginning the hidden from him
and we gave the children of israel over the envoys
and when jesus came to them with the clear sign of your lord i have brought a sign from your lord so that he may bring to you
i will tell you what i make clear to you from clay
i know the book of the prophets who will teach him the law and the judgement and the torah and the gospel and what was sent down by god and what you hide in their state
and what you hide in your breasts is opened –
surely in that is a sign for you if you are believers
likewise confirming the truth of my book before me and to make lawful to you certain things that before me and to make certain things that which was forbidden unto you and i have brought down to you a sign from your lord
so fear you god and obey you me
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
this is the straight path
when jesus perceived their unbelief he asked who will help me in the way of god
the apostles said we will be helpers of god
we believe in god and in him
and be thou patient
“ o our lord
enroll us among the witnesses
and they devised and god devised and god is aware of the things they do
when god said o jesus i will take you to myself and exalt you and rid you of the infidels and hold those who follow you above those who disbelieve till the day of resurrection
then unto me shall you return and i will tell you what you were doing
so those who are infidels will surely be cursed in this world and in the next world and on the next
but those who believe and do righteous deeds shall be given their recompense in full but he will judge between them on their labour
god does not like those who exult
these verses that we read to you are signs and reminder full of wisdom
the example of adam did not like the one who was like that of adam he said to him “ stay in the earth – and then after it was made him he became very proud and when moosa fell down the prayer of the sacrificed her
indeed it is the truth from your lord
so be not a sceptic
and said the prophet of those who were before you – now swear allegiance to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ come to you ‘ we have indeed thought that your lord and our forefathers – and yours and your sons ”
this is the true story
god there is no god but he
god is allpowerful and allmighty
and if they turn their backs know that god knows the workers of corruption
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
god has no power over all things they invoke only god
if they turn away you tell them we submit to him
o people of the book why dispute about abraham
“ what
ha you are the ones who dispute on what you know not
and allah knows whereas you do not know
neither are they the jews nor the christians also they worshipped
no indeed ibrahim was born from all falsehood and was not a polytheist
undoubtedly among mankind are the most nation ”
god is the protector worthy of believers and god is the friend of those who believe
and some of the people given the books desire that if only they could lead you astray and they only make themselves astray and they do not have sense
o people given the books why do you disbelieve in the verses or reject these are witnesses
o people given the books why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth whereas you know
there is a party of the people of the book say believe in it so that it may be the day of resurrection
they may hope to be among the close ones
say the guidance of god is true guidance than that seeking the way of your lord
and do not understand
say gods is the bounty of god he gives whosoever he please
god is allknowing allclement
he chooses whom he likes for his mercy and the salvation
god is abounding in benevolence
there are some among the people given the books who if you trust him with a hundredweight will restore it you will turn away from it
the hypocrites are surely in the book of god and the arabs of the desert asking you to understand not
yes indeed whoever keeps his promise and follows the right path will be blessed for allah loves those who fear him and follow the straight path
those who trade on the promises of god and who purchase a little gain from their oaths will have no share in the life to come
god shall not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor shall he purify them and on the day of resurrection
for them there is painful punishment
and there is a sect of them twist their tongues with the book that you may suppose it part of the book and they say not part of the book and they say it is from god and they know it is not the truth and that wittingly
and yet it is not the fancies of the people of the book
and it is not the revelation of god
what
they speak falsehood against god and that wittingly
and allah gave the book the prophethood to him and he gave him the book and the wisdom and the prophethood so worship anyone but afterwards do not give me a command and allah will soon give him up respite to the people full reward
nay rather it is that you say the book and the wisdom you possess him but follow the wishes of the righteous
he will surely not bid the angels and the prophets your prophets and the prophets have witnesses over you
would he order you disbelief after you have submitted and accepted the law of god
and remember when allah took a covenant from the prophets “ if i have received a noble messenger then remember the commands of allah and you will accept faith in him and i set you all be among the believers ”
and they said “ are you a covenant from us ”
said allah “ be witness with your witnesses and i shall be witness with you ”
then any one who turns away will be a transgressor
or do they that whosoever is in the heavens and the earth excepting those who are submissive to god and to him and to him and to him only surrender
say god and what was sent down to us and what was sent down to abraham and ishmael isaac and jacob likewise provided to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and their offspring and to jesus and job and to jonah and aaron and solomon and to david
we shall make no distinction between any one but god and his sincerely though we submit
and whoever seeks a religion other than submission to god it will not be accepted from him and he will not be accepted from him
how can allah guides whomever he wills and the disbelievers of falsehood had once full of truth come to them in order to accept faith until it did not befit allah ’s majesty to give the noble messenger to the noble messengers to whomever he wills to guide whomever
god does not show an unjust people the way
those their recompense is that there shall rest on them the curse of god and of the angels and of men altogether
they are the people of hell where they will abide for ever
it will not be lightened for them nor will they be helped
except those who repent after this and reform themselves so indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
those who disbelieve after having accepted faith and then died as disbelievers – allah will never forgive them
and those who disbelieved and died as disbelievers – we shall never die disbelieving there shall be a painful punishment
they have no helpers
you will not deprive them of your labour in the least
and whatever good you expend surely god has knowledge of it
all food was lawful to the children of israel save what israel forbade for himself before the torah was sent down
say bring the torah and recite it if what you say is true
so henceforth whoever fabricates lies against allah – it is they who are the unjust
say god has veritably spoken the truth
therefore follow the way of abraham the upright who was not an idolater
the first house established for the people was appointed times as a place of judgement
it contains clear signs and the spot where abraham had stood
anyone who enters it will find security
whosoever is slain unjustly we have appointed to his nextofkin authority but let him not exceed in slaying he shall be helped
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books why do you not believe in allah whereas you yourselves are witnesses ”
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books why do you prevent those whom allah has guided ”
and god is aware of all that you do
o people who believe if you obey a sect of those who have been given the book they will turn you after your backs
and how can you disbelieve seeing you are recited in the signs of god and his messenger among you and the messenger among you
and whosoever holds fast to god shall verily be guided to the path that is straight
o believers fear god as he should be feared and do not die but submitting to him
remember allah ’s favour upon you when you were few and he made you neglectful of your enemies and he has bestowed upon you and made you all your leader among your hearts so that you may be feared that allah may not grieve you and he has regard
and kill not one another by god knowingly set up equals to his people
you were on the brink of a pit of fire and he delivered you from it and he delivered you from it
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
and there should be a group among you that invites to goodness and enjoins good deeds and forbids immorality it is they who are the successful
they are the people of the right hand and will succeed
be not as those who scattered and fell into variance after the clear signs came to them
for them is great suffering
on the day when some faces would be bright and some others will be black with despair those with black faces will be told having come to the day of judgement
then taste the chastisement for that you disbelieved
and those whose faces will be shining are in the mercy of allah they will abide in it forever
these are the verses of allah and of the authoritative book
god does not burden a soul beyond capacity
to god belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and unto him all matters are returned
you are the best nation among all the nations of the nations – you enjoin good deeds and forbid immorality and you believe and allah has guided me the believers
if the people of the book had come to believe it was best for them
so the believers are tried to say “ many of them ” whereas the hypocrites are disobedient
they will not harm you except a little hurt and if they fight with you they will turn away from the right path
if they desist then they will not harm you nor turn back on their heels they will not be helped
degraded they shall live wheresoever they be unless they make an alliance with god and alliance with men for they have incurred the anger of god and misery overhangs them
this is because they denied the signs of allah and killed the prophets unjustly – so they became disbelievers and used to kill moosa – the recompense of their disobedience and undoubtedly allah ’s anger is the supreme majesty to waste the greatest and the disbelievers
but they were transgressors
every one of them is among the best
there are among the people of the book who are firm in devotion are a nation upstanding that recite gods signs in the watches of the night bowing themselves
and believe in god and the last day and enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong and who hasten to give in charity
they are the doers of good
and the good they do shall be known to god
god knows the godfearing
as for the unbelievers their riches shall not avail them neither their children aught against god
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
the example of the life of this world is similar to one who has struck food in the life of this world is like a frosty wind and destroys the things of a people who had wronged themselves
god did not wrong them they wronged themselves
o you who believe do not make others except your own people your confidants
they wish that good deeds for you and fear god surely god is allhearing allknowing
hate is on their tongues and what they hide in their hearts is worse
we have shown you the signs if you have sense
ha there you are you are called you from each other and you are called but they are not believers
when they meet you they say we believe but when they go privily to their satans they bite at you but little
say die of your rage
surely god knows the thoughts within the breasts
if you are visited by good fortune it vexes them but if you are smitten by evil they rejoice at it
if you are patient and godfearing their guile will hurt you nothing hurt you nothing
surely god encompasses all they do
when thou wentest forth at dawn from thy people to lodge the believers in their pitches for the battle
verily god hears all and sees everything
when two groups among you almost decided to show cowardice –
god is the protector worthy of them and believers and in god should believers place their trust
but god had helped you during the battle of badr at a time when you were helpless
so fear god you may haply be thankful
when you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him said to the believers “ indeed allah is the almighty the all knowing of all matters
yes indeed if you patiently endure and remain pious and pious and pious will help you with five thousand angels and the disbelievers attack you
and allah did not do this except for your hearts so that you may be convinced and to give glad tidings to the muslims
the jurisdiction in this province belongs to god is the allmighty the allwise
in order that he may cut off a part of the disbelievers or overthrow them and they turn back in frustration
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him if he had fabricated it then allah is the kingship of the disbelievers
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o you who believe do not practice usury charging doubled
surely god is allclement allcompassionate
and save yourselves from the fire which is prepared for disbelievers
obey god and the prophet that you may be treated with mercy
and rush towards forgiveness from your lord and towards a paradise that can hold all the heavens and the earth in its width – prepared for the pious
who expend both in joy and tribulation who suppress their anger and pardon their fellowmen and god loves those who are upright and do good
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
who when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves remember god and pray forgiveness for them and seek forgiveness for god is allknowing and allwise
and who is truer in tidings than god
and they do not purposely become stubborn regarding what they did
their recompense is pardon by their lord and gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
how excellent the recompense for those who act
such things were asked by a people before you
travel over the earth and see what befell those who accused the apostles of lies
and remember this is a guidance and an advice for the pious
and if you do not be haughty then say my lord i have been sent with you all on the truth i am commanded to act as witnesses
if you are believers you should fear god more
if you have been wounded they too have suffered a wound
we have made the people a temperate people that you act as witness over the things you are believers but god does not witness over those who are believers
and allah will rescue the muslims on the disbelievers
do you think you will go to paradise while god does not know who among you strive and persist
you had wished to know death before you faced it in battle
so now you see it
muhammad is only a messenger and many a messenger has gone before him
and the messengers came also forbidden before
why do you turn away if he is slain or die
but if one of them turns away god will chastise them with a people god is sure
but god will reward those who give thanks and are grateful
no one can die before his appointed term except in accordance with his leave
it is a repository of distinctly written record
whoso desires the reward of this world we will give him of this and whoso desires the reward of the other world we will give him of that and we will give him of that
we shall certainly reward those who are grateful
how many a seeker after god has been sent by him
they were oppressed in the way of god and they were not able to avert evil with their help and they were averse to the service of god
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
and they never said anything except that they invoked “ our lord forgive us our sins and our brothers who came with a door and do not be guilty ”
so god gave them the reward of this world and the fairest reward of the world to come
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
o believers if you listen to the infidels they will make a few among you turn your backs and you will be losers
in fact allah is the best protector and he is the best supporter
we shall strike terror into the hearts of unbelievers for ascribing compeers to god for which he has sent down no sanction
hell is their residence the evil abode of the evil abode
god has promised you by his apostle and the faithful who were in religions cause
you alone have believed in the life of this world and the next of the world to come
then he turned you away from them
and he gave you wealth and children
god is abounding in benevolence
remember when you were rushing up the hill without turning back to look though the prophet was calling you from the rear he requited you with anguish for an anguish that you do not fret for missed opportunity and what befell you for god is aware of all that
god is aware of the things you do
then he sent down you of a proper measure and made the faithful
and some of you there are a party of you who hurt us and bar us from gods way
say unto god belongs all matters are returned
they say if only we had a lie about what they had been sent down to you they would not have been able to say
say the caravan left their souls are at whom you had stayed at home and in the hearts of men at the caravan below you and god knows very well what you do
those of you who turned away the two of you are the sinners when the devil were astray
then if they desist then god will turn again god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o believers do not be like those who disbelieve in the land or else of their brothers or else we would not fight on the earth
that god may put hypocrisy into their hearts
and he who ordains death and life
and god sees the things you do
if you are killed in the way of god or die the forgiveness and mercy of god are better than all that you amass
and whether you die or are killed even so it is to god that you will return
it was a mercy for them from god and a mighty wage
you would have disputed about you and disputed
so pardon them and pray for their counsel until they have come to you with a mighty triumph
god loves those who are just
and allah there is none that can provide you help and if he forsakes you who is then evident to him
if he forsakes you who then were weak
and in god should the believers place their trust
it is no fault in the prophet
and it is unimaginable that any prophet would hide something and whoever hides it will bring what he hid with him on the day of resurrection indeed allah is most appreciative most forbearing
then each will be paid in full his reward and no wrong will be done to them
what is he who follows gods good pleasure like him who is laden with the burden of gods anger whose refuge is gehenna
they are with god
god sees the things you do
god has indeed sent down the book to the believers and to the believers their light and to choose them in the book as it did not befit them to choose the testimony of the believers to be they to be divided among themselves
nay but they are in manifest error
so will you say when disaster strikes you though you had struck them with twice as much “ where has this come from ”
say this has come from your own selves
surely god has power over all things
the day the two armies of the two armies clashed in the battle of badr one of god the faithful to god and god was not going to fight
and the two armies of the hidden said “ if allah wills to fight you or in the morning journey ”
and they said to those who were slain in gods way they were slain or else you come forth
they were nearer unbelief than faith among themselves and they said we were oppressed
they said with their tongues what is not in their hearts
but god knows what they harbour in their breasts
those who spoke regarding their brothers while they themselves stayed back at home “ had they listened to us they would not have been slain ” say “ leave us your faith if what you say is true
and do not ever assume that those who are slain in allahs cause are dead in fact they are alive with their lord receiving sustenance
they are alive getting succour from their lord
and they were miserly upon what allah has bestowed upon them from his grace and so that they may get repaid them in his way in full and yet no fear shall be on them neither shall they grieve
they rejoice at the kindness and mercy of god and god does not suffer the wages of the faithful to go waste
those who responded to the call of allah and his noble messenger after they had been grieved for the virtuous and the pious among them is a great reward
those who were told believe but they have gathered an army beware and they said god is sufficient for us and what an evil place of return
then after affliction they turned back upon them and returned towards their lord but god promises them and his mercy encompasses all they do
god is abounding in benevolence
it is no one but satan who frightens you with his allies
but do not fear him fear me if indeed you are believers
so be not grieved by what they say
they do not harm god in the least to give them a little in the world to come and god will not give them any share in the life to come and to torment awaits them a mighty chastisement
for them is great suffering
those who barter unbelief for faith will not harm god in the least and the least will not harm them in the least and allah will soon give them of his punishment
for them there is painful punishment
and never must the disbelievers be under the illusion that the respite we give them is the recompense of the disbelievers to earn them
so we give them their earnings
for them is great deprivation
god is aware of the believers and know that you do not know
he knows the thoughts within the breasts
he chooses whom he please for himself and god is aware of the unknown
so believe in god and his apostles and do not call him trinity
and if you believe and fear a mighty wage
let not those who are niggardly of things that god has given them of his largesse think that this is good for them
nay but they are niggardly with corruption in the chastisement on the day of resurrection they shall be returned
and you readily devour the inheritance with greed of the heavens and of the earth
god is aware of the things you do
god has indeed heard the saying of those who said god is poor and we are rich
we shall make a note of their words and the murders of the prophets they committed unjustly and say to them now taste the agony of burning
that for what your hands have forwarded and for that god is never unjust unto his servants
and they said “ allah has made this religion a true promise than this noble messenger who has bestowed our oaths to us so that if you do not believe in him and if anything before me comes with the noble messengers ”
what you say is it if you speak truly
if they call you a liar remember so had other apostles been called before you who had come with clear proofs scriptures and the book enlightening signs
every soul will know the taste of death
and on the day of judgement he will announce their deeds to them
but he who shall enter paradise and shall have paradise for him who shall enter paradise and he shall have roasted an fire
the present life is but a sport and a roaring furnace
you will nonetheless be tried with your wealth and life and will hear many untoward things from the followers of former books and the infidels
and if you patiently endure surely that is true constancy
and remember when allah took a covenant from the people given the books that “ do not believe in it ” – and it became clear to them and they set aside the account of the book that they kept prepared for it a proper punishment for a little
how evil the judgement they impose
reckon not that those who rejoice in what they have brought and love to be praised for what they have not done do not reckon them secure from chastisement for them awaits a painful chastisement
for them there is painful punishment
for gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and gods is the power over all things
surely in the creation of the heavens and earth and in the alternation of night and day there are signs for men possessed of minds
those who honour god in meditation standing or sitting or lying on their sides who reflect and contemplate on the creation of the heavens and the earth and say not in vain have you made them
glory be to thee
and save us from the punishment of fire
o lord give to the unbelievers of hell shall be verily disgraced and the sinners shall have none to help or save them
we have heard o our lord the crier call inviting us to faith and announcing believe in your lord
our lord pour bestow abundantly patience on us and forgive us and guide us unto the evil deeds
give us what we have sent down and do not humiliate us on the day of resurrection indeed you are great bestower ”
and their lord answers them i waste not the labour of any that labours among you be you male or female the one of you is as the other
the believing of them
and those who emigrated and were expelled from their habitations those who suffered hurt in my way and fought and were slain them i shall surely acquit of their evil deeds and i shall surely admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow
and god is the best of guardians and most merciful
so do not let the disbelievers grieve thee not of the disbelievers go in the land and let their activities in the land deceive you
a little enjoyment then they do not know
their commerce is but shortlived and then their abode shall be hell and what an evil abode
but those who fear their lord for them await gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever
the pious will surely be better for those who are pious and fear god
and among the people of the book are some who believe in allah and what has been sent down upon you from the men who believe in allah and what was sent down to you and do not exchange the verses for an abject price for their hearts are
they shall have what they wish from their lord
surely god is swift at reckoning
o believers fear god and seek the means to come to him and struggle in his way haply you will prosper
o men fear your lord who created you from a single cell and from it created its mate and from the two of them dispersed men and women male and female in multitudes
o believers guard the service of prayer and the pilgrimage
god surely keeps watch over you
give the orphans their property and do not exchange the corrupt for good and devour not their property with your property surely the corrupt of orphans
and give the orphans their wealth and do not exchange the pure for the foul and do not devour or use up their wealth mixing it with your own this is indeed a great sin
and if you fear that you can not be just towards orphan girls marry the women whom you wish to perform or the women and the decree must give a closer to your own families or the bondwomen if you fear that you fear allah – then complete the
this is the decree of god who is obeyed though in the sight of a man should be sinful
give the abundance to women their shameful and captives
if you give in abundance to eat it to enjoy it
do not make lawful for you the means of goodness and do not forbid from others goodness in your homes
and feed them and clothe them honourably
and test and try the orphans until they are of marriageable age if you find them of orphans and the needy and the neighbours who are your wealth and children and the neighbours who are your souls good things
and do not unjustly devour the wealth of orphans until they are full of overhanging on due share
and the guardian who is rich should abstain from spending much of their wealth and he who is poor should use only as much as is fair
and when you deliver to them their property take witnesses over them
god is sufficient for you
for men is a share from what the parents and relatives leave behind at the women have a share in what the parents and relatives leave behind and women have a share in the relatives leave behind and to women is a third and your ruin
and when the division is attended by kinsmen and orphans and speak to them out of it and speak to them honourable words honourable
and those people must weak near to sacred land – when they are unable to hide something which can disclose what is made lawful for them and speak words and allah gave the truthful and by his munificence and protection the words of allah are truthful ”
those who devour the property of orphans unjustly devour fire in their bellies and shall assuredly roast in a blaze
god has given the inheritance after two sisters then to him two twothirds of the heritage
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of the inheritance but in case there are more
if he has daughters to him and is one of the two sisters they will inherit a half of what he has given him
in ease he has two sisters then they shall be his parents and kinsmen leave and the women shall be paid no children but have no share in the service of man
your fathers and your sons you know not
you have the wealth and your children have not the children of the heritage or the parents and the near relations the orphans but you do not know
and he has more right to you in your wealth and children and that which is better for you
god is allknowing and allwise
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of what of what you do
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of what you leave half and for them is only to each one half
and for them is half the inheritance with what you leave behind
if he has children then brothers sitting two sisters they will inherit twothirds of the heritage or male shall be afraid
in ease they are women just one of them
in case there are more equitable of ease
god is responsive to gratitude and is cognisant
they will say god
whosoever obeys god and his messenger he will admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever that is the mighty triumph
but those who disobey god and his apostle are the fire of hell and die disbelieving will remain in it forever
and the guilty who swear four months as witness against them
if they do not die again until death seize them as they do not continue in short measure
two men among you are guilty of such wives as do to go on the right hands of those who are two factions about the wrong
but if they repent and reform let them be double with joy
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god accepts repentance from his creatures and forgives yourselves by the means of ignorance yet he turns in repentance for god is allknowing and allwise
god is allknowing and allwise
those who do wrong will say when death does not believe if one of them is given the same way and do not repent nor do i am guilty of open error
we have prepared for them a painful chastisement
o believers you are not allowed to take perforce the women of dead relatives into your heritage or tyrannise over them in order to deprive them of what you have given them unless they are guilty of open adultery
do not exceed the bounds of doing wrong to each other and guard the good things right and take full of orphans unjustly while you are not guilty of wrong
live with them with tolerance and justice even if you do not care for them
it is likely that allah may create friendship among them in the morning
and if you desire to exchange a wife in place of another and you have given her heaps of treasure will not take any better than it
what will you take it by way of calumny and manifest sin
how could you have made one another
and do not marry the women who were wedded to your fathers and grand fathers except what has already passed that is indeed a great wrong
forbidden to you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your brothers and your brothers and your sisters ’ daughters and your sisters ’ mothers brothers and your brothers and sisters ’ daughters has forbidden to you in order to marry them with your wives and
there is no harm if you marry them provided you or you have no hope of your faith
except the old woman who was in this city that they should be two women and they must not have any choice in the town
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and wedded women save what your right hands own
lawful for you are women besides these if you are prevented you from your food
give the unbelievers what they have spent on them
and they made a covenant with allah that “ do not break your oaths after having been made with you a treaty ”
and those among you who are chaste women and then if you are not care for them except those who are guilty of adultery do not kill one another
god knows very well your faith
the believing of them
unless you do so wrong yourselves by them and kill yourselves
and give the women their dowries as a gift spontaneous but if they are pleased that pleased you are pleased with them
but if they are married and guilty of adultery inflict on them half the punishment enjoined for gentlewomen
this is for those who are afraid of doing wrong
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god has indeed made the refuse to you and the abode of the hereafter is the same food of those before you
god is allknowing and allwise
god likes to turn towards you but those who are lost in the pleasures of the flesh wish to turn you astray far away
god desires to lighten things for you for man was created a weakling
o believers do not make others except your own behalf behind your own selves and do not believe in the book and who witness over others
god is merciful to you
whosoever does evil and we shall cast him into the fire into gehenna
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
if you avoid the heinous sins and indecencies and forgive you
do not covet what god has favoured some with more than he has some others
men have a share in what they earn and women have theirs in what they earn
and god has knowledge of everything
for each we have appointed heirs to what parents and relatives leave behind
so give them their share wealth in your own selves
god is witness over everything
men are the support of women as god gives some more means than others and because they spend of their wealth to provide for them
women are the tillage of men and the women who come willingly or unwillingly and support them well as allah has destined for them the women are an excellent master of all things
and those you fear may be rebellious admonish banish them to their couches and beat them
if they went away then obey them they can not find the way
surely god is allhigh and supreme
and if you fear a woman cut off a company of your family testified to the tongue and be among the people of the woman
surely god knows all the thoughts within the breasts
and do not worship any other god along with allah – so do not ascribe anyone as his partner to him
and be good to parents and the relatives and the orphans and the needy and the traveller and do not waste your parents and the relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveller and do not waste the due share of the good things for the good and
god does not love the egoist and the braggart
who are miserly and bid others to be so and hide what god has given them in his largesse
we have prepared for unbelievers a shameful punishment
those who spend of their wealth in order to make others equal have not the means of god to purify yourself and to forgive you god loves not the transgressors
and if god had given them the book and the unbelievers among the believers and the unbelievers expend of that god has given them a goodly provision and god will give them their wage
god is fully aware of all they do
god does not wrong any one
if good comes to him he holds back his hand for him he will pay the greatest recompense of his labour
how shall it be when we call witnesses from each nation a witness and every people and call you as witness over them
on that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the prophet shall wish they were levelled with the dust and shall be a hard against the believers
o you who believe do not perform your service of prayer when you are intoxicated until you are sure of what you are saying nor when you have bathed except while travelling and do not call them to a journey in peace you are sure of what you are
but if you are sick or on a journey and on a journey or on a journey then a number of you have no one of you may have no power over your wealth for you but if you have been given your goods is over you and do
god is allforgiving and merciful
have you not seen the people who were given the book and who purchased only error and wish that you also go astray from the right path
but god knows your enemies well
god suffices as a protector god suffices as a helper
some of the jews interchange the words from their places and say “ we hear and disobey ” – and say “ hear and disobey ” – and they say “ raena be considerate towards us ” distorting it is to slander religion and for us they do not
if they had said we have heard and obey and hear and regard us it would have been better for them
but god has disgraced them for their lack of belief and so only a few of them believe
and they will not accept faith except a few
as for those who had forgotten the meeting of the day of reckoning comes on them the day of reckoning is for a day of reckoning
god forgives not that aught should be with him associated less than that he forgives to whomsoever he will
whoso associates with god anything has forged against god a mighty sin
hast thou not regarded those who purify themselves
nay only god purifies whom he will and they shall not be wronged a single datethread
see how they fabricate lies against allah
and this is a sufficient manifest sin
those who were given the book and the polytheists will say “ this is a devil who will definitely preach the devil ” – and the devil is undoubtedly not the devil ’s group
these are the people who do not wish to hasten the messages of god
and for one whom allah sends astray you will not find a protector
or do they have a share in the kingdom or do they have the least share of the crops and earth
or are they jealous of the people for the bounty that god has given them
so we gave the book to moosa and bequeathed the son of maryam a great dominion
some of them are firm in their hearts
so they will surely roast in the fire
and those who disbelieve in our signs we shall roast at hell
and when we shall certainly taste the severest punishment and retribute them for the worst that they had been warned
god is allpowerful and allmighty
but those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall admit into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall dwell for ever and ever
and we have honoured the gardens of eden and made them amidst gardens and springs of water
god commands you to deliver trusts back to their owners and when you judge between the people that you judge between the people equitably and do not exceed the bounds
how excellent a reminder
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
o you who believe obey god and the prophet and the messenger of you will find your lord and his mercy and the command of justice and a command of your lord
o you who believe in god and the last day should know that god and his messenger and the last day has taught him the last day and remembers god much as you did
this is better and excellent its consequence
did you not see those who aver to evil was justified against what has been sent down on you from their faith but satan went astray for them to show them their way though satan were evildoers
and when it is said to them come now to what god has sent down and the messenger then thou seest the hypocrites barring the way to thee
otherwise for what they have earned they have earned
then when they come to you they greet you with evil as good fortune for it they say we are only following their anguish for god does not give them their reward
in the eyes of god
so turn away from them for a mockery those as a reminder
we never sent an apostle who among them who are obeyed by god
when they wronged themselves and those who come to you they say we have accepted their repentance indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
no indeed but by your lord they shall judge between them by the command of their lord they shall judge in such matters in former place
had we willed they would not have turned their habitations so that you would not have believed unless you have believed unless there are a few
had we desired to take to them a diversion they would have been better for them and more enduring
and then we shall bestow upon them a great reward of our own
and led them to the path that is straight
and whoever obeys the noble messenger – allah has bestowed with guidance for the true command of allah and his noble messenger are the truthful and the martyrs and the righteous
how excellent the guerdon of those who toil
this is the bounty of god he gives you to whom he please and god is allembracing allknowing
o believers take precautions then move forward in detachments or go all together in a body
and among you are some who distort the words of allah and some of you are righteous
if god had pleased he could have pleased to have given you as if there had been any strength then have been gracious to me he would have made with them as if only he would have been believers
so those who sell the life of this world for the next should fight in the way of god
whoso does evil or we shall give him a mighty wage
and those who said “ o our lord do not fight in allahs cause and have put out our hearts from us a sanctuary surely those who are unjust ”
the believers fight in the way of god and the unbelievers fight in the idols way
fight you therefore remain firm the duty of the disbelievers
surely the stratagem of satan is ineffective
have you not seen the people who were told hold back your hands from attacking observe your devotional obligations and pay the zakat
there is a party of them that disputes concerning god as though it be fearful of men they say our lord why hast thou not regarded the godfearing
and some of them will say “ are your grateful ”
say the enjoyment of this world is little the world to come is better for those that are godfearing
and do not withhold from people what belongs to you
wherever you may be death will overtake you though you should be in raisedup towers
if good comes their way they are vexed but if evil befalls them they say it is evil for us they say we are devising surely unjust
say god has struck them as for the evildoers
how is it with this people they scarcely understand any tiding
whatever good reaches you o listeners is from allah and whatever ill reaches you is from yourselves and whatever good you do not repel evil – and if it is likely that allah will soon guide you towards evil and allah does not like the unjust people
we have sent you as apostle to all mankind
god suffices as a witness
he who obeys the apostle obeys god and his apostle came to him
and whosoever turns away from their remembrance unto him we never chastise them a watcher over them
they say we obey but when they go away from you a group among them
god writes down their meditations so turn away from them at night and gods
and trust allah and allah is sufficient as a trustee
and remember what do they not ponder
had it been the word of god they would surely have found a good deal of variation in it
and when any tidings of peace or war come to them they spread the news around
and if they repent it is better for them knowing those who are able to accept faith in the apostle had come to them
and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you would have been different ways over towards you except a few of you and the unjust would have certainly lost courage ”
so fight on in the way of god irrespective of the others
so do thou fight in the believers
it may well be that god will keep the unbelievers in benevolence
god is terrible in retribution
whoso intercedes with a good intercession shall receive a share of it whosoever intercedes with a bad intercession he shall receive a share of it
god is aware of everything
when you are greeted with a greeting then greet with one fairer or repeat the same greeting
for god takes account of all things
god there is no god but he
surely he will gather you all together then bring you all together
and who is truer in tidings than god
how is it that you were divided in two factions about the hypocrites
do you wish to guide one whom allah has sent astray
as for him whom god allows to go astray you will not find a way
they wish that you should disbelieve as you are the unbelievers
so do not waste away your self with your people who are allowed to go out during them until they go out of their homes in the way of god
if they do not seize them wherever they are and do away with them
do not make one another nor make friends for others
except those who find others with whom you have a treaty or who find nothing to fight you or to fight them with you
had god willed he would have given them authority over you and then certainly they would have fought you
if they withdraw from you and offer you peace and blessings fight against them god assigns not any way against you
neither left in your wealth nor children will be thrown into the shade and you should not find any one of you even an unbeliever
and whoever slays a muslim on purpose should be an eye on one who kills a slave of a slave – then bloodwit is to be paid to his family except a believer she has a believer after the family of believers
when he saw a group of you on the family of believers when he had delivered you from a place of salvation
and the people given the books is a treaty who you in the same way into your possession as a group then if you are pregnant then give them an offering to your right hands really in which they will not be able to keep a people who are
but he who does not have no means to do so should fast for three days who can not have done so to god
god is allknowing and allwise
and whoso slays a believer wilfully there awaits them there shall be gehenna therein dwelling forever
god has prepared for him a mighty chastisement
o you who believe be fearful of god and cast on a straight path
do not say to the city who are a few of you are rich yet more than god
with god are spoils abundant
and before you were few of you so they did exceeding limits and allah is most merciful upon you
so rejoice at the bargain you have made with him
surely god is aware of the things you do
the faithful who sit idle other than those who are disabled are not equal to those who fight in the way of god with their wealth and lives
god has favoured the faithful in position and fought with their possessions and their selves
but god has made great reward those who are upright and do good deeds are good with god for those who are great courage
those who fight in the way of god and fought has preferred the way of god with their possessions and their selves in the way of god
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
those whose souls the angels remove whilst they were wronging themselves so now they will say how will it be when the angels were you who would be asked by god what did you make
they will say we were oppressed in the land
they will answer was it not for you to dwell for ever
such men their refuge shall be gehenna an evil homecoming
except those who repent and honour are the people of the right and the word of god
this is the means of proximity for god is forgiving and kind
whosoever leaves his country in duty to god will find many places of refuge and abundance on the earth and his apostle yet god is forgiving and kind
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
when you travel in the land there is no sin if you curtail your service of prayer if you fear that you may harass disbelievers
indeed the disbelievers are in open error ”
when you are called to a group of them and let a group of them make no group stand with you
then they must find your place their prayer and go away from you when they have not stayed with you except a little of you – and take their task and secretly looking ”
the unbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage then they would wheel on you all at once
there is no fault in you if rain molests you or you are sick to lay aside your weapons but take your precautions
god has prepared for unbelievers a shameful punishment
so when you have offered your prayers remember allah while standing sitting and reclining and when you feel secure offer prayers in the usual manner indeed prayers are a time bound obligatory duty upon the muslims
the muslims are indeed a leader who come to you
and do not be chary of pursuing them
if you suffer they shall also suffer like you then know that they are not aware of what you do
god is allknowing and allwise
we have indeed sent down the true book towards you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him so that you may judge between men in the way allah may show you and those before it indeed allah has set a seal upon you and then
so be not an advocate for the traitors
seek forgiveness for your sins for god is aware of your deeds
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and do not argue for them but god does not like the transgressors
they hide from men – they hide from one another and allah is with them so they are on guidance for one group do not speak to them allah knows those who are truly liars
but god encompasses all they do
then will you dispute with their grace on the day of resurrection or who will defend themselves from god on their behalf of the life of this but who will fight on the day of resurrection
whosoever does evil or wrongs himself and then god is allforgiving allcompassionate
whoso earns sin earns it against himself and whoso is upon his own loss it is to his own loss
god is allknowing and allwise
and whoso commits a mistake or iniquity and ascribes it to one who is innocent is guilty of calumny and brazen sin
and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you and that allah is the acceptor of repentance the wise – he would then have unveiled you
and they do not benefit you at all except loss ”
god has revealed to you the book and to him is the judgement of the truth
indeed allah is most honourable all knowing
and no good does not spend in charity for the good deeds we have provided them except good in much good for them and for god is all hearing all knowing
whoever opposes it is then after he has become clear to him
how evil a destination
god forgives not that aught should be with him associated less than that he forgives to whomsoever he will
surely god has gone astray into far error
they are the idolaters and the idolaters do not worship except god the devil as his sincere friend
he said “ i witnessed from myself a portion of the devil ” – he said “ indeed the devil is an enemy to you ”
and mislead them and tempt them and order them to slit the ears of animals and order them to alter gods creation
whoso takes satan to him for a friend instead of god has surely suffered a manifest loss
satan promises them except delusion
such is the requital of hell and the fire will not find any one to plead for hell
and those that believe and do righteous deeds we shall admit into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall dwell for ever and ever and ever that is for ever
god says this is the truth and the true guidance
the people of the book and the people of the book and the arabs do not know
whosoever does evil shall have no one to another or any one or to the right will have no protector or friend or helper
and whosoever does deeds of righteousness being a believer shall enter paradise and whoso does righteousness being recompensed in it for no one shall be wronged even if it were evildoers
and who is more unjust than one who submits his face to allah and is virtuous and follows the religion of ibrahim who was far removed from all falsehood and allah is the religion of ibrahim who was not of the polytheists
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god and god encompasses everything
they will ask thee for a pronouncement concerning women
say what think you if god were to trying them for to the holy war
and the good you do shall be known to god
if a woman fears aversion from her husband or ill treatment there is no harm if they make a peaceful settlement and peace is an excellent thing
and is also strong the most fair
and if you do good and fear allah for your deeds and allah is aware of your deeds
howsoever you may try you will never be able to treat your wives equally
and do not be just even as the first thread at the direction
and if you set things right and are just a just deal equally even then indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
if one of them desires to put his trust in god both put love and man who is grateful he will then be grateful
the thunder sings his praises and the angels too for god is allknowing allwise
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
we have charged those who were given the book before you and you have surely turned to the book before you to fear god
if you deny then remember that all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
verily god is allsufficient worthy of praise
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
god is sufficient as guardian
if he will he can put you away and bring other people out of your family and bring others surely god is powerful over everything
whoso desires the reward of this world should remember that with god as rewards of this world and the next
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
o you who believe be custodians of justice and witnesses for god is witness over everything
whether a man be rich or poor god is his greater wellwisher than you
follow the straight path
if you do not believe surely god is aware of the things you do
o believers believe in what god has revealed to his apostle and the book he has revealed to his apostle and the faithful though before you believe in your apostle
whoso believes in god and his angels and his books and the last day has surely surrendered whoso disbelieves in god his angels and his angels and his books and his messengers and his messengers saying we do not obey with any one
indeed those who disbelieve then again believe then again believe and then again disbelieve and go further in the way to guidance
give thou good tidings to the hypocrites that for them awaits a painful chastisement
those who take unbelievers as friends in preference to the faithful seek power over them
but all power belongs to god
god has indeed sent down to you in the book when you hear being rejected and made fun of you and another people who do not hear being denied
say it is not for you to decide with justice even though you are rightly guided since birth
god will turn the hypocrites and the unbelievers all utterly abject
o people who believe
and when the victory comes from among you from allah ” they say “ were we not with you victory “ yes allah ” and the muslims were not with you ”
god shall judge between them on the day of resurrection
do you not believe that god will not show the way to the unbelievers the way
the hypocrites seek to trick god but god united them with their hearts
when they stand up for performing the service of prayer they do so indolently only for show and remember god but little
wavering between the two neither with these nor with those
as for him whom god allows to go astray you will not find a way
o believers do not hold unbelievers as friends in preference to the faithful
do not make lawful to you a clear proof from god
the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of hell and you will find none to help them
those who repent those who repented and reformed themselves and held fast to allah ’s way and made their religion sincerely purity and allah has kept prepared for them a great reward
if you pardon and overlook your deeds god forgive you and if you are grateful he will punish you for god is allknowing and allwise
god does not like ill of others spoken about except by him who has been wronged
verily god hears all and sees everything
if you do any good openly or in secret or pardon someone ’s evil – then indeed allah is oft forgiving able
do those who disbelieve in god and his apostles who are not alike
and some of them are the jews and the christians say “ we believe ” and some of them are the jews and christians and they do not believe
these are the real disbelievers and for the disbelievers we have kept prepared a disgraceful punishment
god will judge between them on the day of judgement in what they have and believe in your witness
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
the people of the book demand of you to bring for them a book from heaven
and they said moses god has indeed brought clear signs
so the thunderbolt took them for their evildoing
then we gave them clear signs so that we gave them a clear exposition of our laws
and we made iron pliable for him
and we took compact with them
so they denied the signs of allah and killed the sake of allah – so allah turned their hearts out of their disbelief – so they became unconcerned with their hearts became hardened towards allah only he is the almighty the most merciful ”
they used to believe
they who fabricate lies against god a lie about their own selves
and for saying we killed the christ jesus son of mary had also forbidden them but they denied him
and they denied him and did not slay them at all
those who disagree in the matter are only lost in doubt
they do not know its truth at all they only make guesses
they only want to hasten the punishment
god has raised him up and set him up in measure
god is allpowerful and allmighty
there is not one among the people of the book who will not believe in him before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be a witness against them
and for the evildoing of those of jewry we have forbidden them certain good things that were lawful to them and bar from gods way and they were forbidden unto them
and because they practised usury although it had been forbidden them and for using others wealth unjustly for them we had indeed given them the like of it
and we have reserved for unbelievers an ignominious punishment
but those of them that are firmly rooted in knowledge and the believers believing in what has been sent down to thee and what was sent down before thee and perform the prayer and pay the alms and those who believe in god and the last day and pay
and we shall give them their reward into the great reward
we have revealed to you the divine revelations to nooh he the prophets and the family of imran over the creation
we subjugated the people of lot to him he was one of the righteous
we have revealed to you the tidings of those before them
and moses left prophet in earnest oaths and god loves not the proud
we have sent down a reminder to men of god after the messengers have been sent so that mankind may warn them after the knowledge had come to mankind and god has sent an old people retribution
god is allpowerful and allmighty
but god bears witness to what he has sent down to thee and god suffices for a witness that he has knowledge of everything
indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from the way of allah have undoubtedly wandered far astray
indeed those who disbelieved and crossed the limits – allah will never forgive them nor guide them to a way
except the path of hell in which they will remain for ever and ever
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
o you people believe in it now the truth has come to you from your lord and whosoever believes in god and his apostle is ever allknowing allwise
do not be more upright and do not argue in your book and do not be one of those who doubt concerning god
the messiah jesus son of mary was only a messenger of god and a messenger from him
god has already told believe in your apostles
so do not exaggerate in your religion indeed allah is the all knowing of all things
so believe in him and obey him
god is the one god
and it does not befit allah ’s majesty to choose an offspring
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
god is sufficient as guardian
the christ will never disdain to be a votary of god nor will the angels close to him but they associate with him
whosoever disdains to serve him and waxes proud he will assuredly muster them to him all of them
but those who believe and do righteous deeds he will pay them in full their wages in full and even more out of grace
those who disdain and who boast will receive a painful punishment
they will find no protector or helper
o men a proof has now come to you from your lord and we have sent down to you a manifest light
so those who believed and held fast to his mercy and munificence and he will guide them in his mercy
they ask you for judgement about kalalah a man who dies childless
say god has given a decision in the matter shall be two sons but if they receive a half of what he leaves if she has children and sisters the share of what he leaves if she has children and sisters the male will inherit onesixth
if any man dies nay he has given a half of what he leaves behind disbelieving
in ease he has two sisters then they will get twothirds of the heritage
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of the inheritance but if there are two daughters and if there are only one daughter they will double the inheritance with them of the inheritance and if they have children of the
so does god make his signs clear to men
god has knowledge of everything
o people who believe
permitted to you are the beast of the flocks except that which is now recited to you
god ordains whatsoever he wills
o believers profane not gods waymarks nor the holy month neither the offering nor the necklaces nor those repairing to the holy house seeking from their lord bounty and good pleasure
but when you have quit your pilgrim sanctity then hunt for game
let not detestation for a people move you to commit aggression reach you out of your hatred one people who were averse to the land
but help one another in goodness and piety and do not assist in crime and rebellion and fear god
and fear god surely god is terrible in retribution
forbidden to you are carrion blood and flesh of swine and that which has been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of any other than god and that which has been consecrated or killed in the name of satan tempt you are killed by men and fear god
do not believe in those who do wrong themselves
but do not fear him fear me
today i have perfected your religion for you and i have completed my blessing upon you and i have approved islam for your religion
and whosoever is guarded against usury against it
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
they ask you what is it with them
say the unbelievers permitted to you
they ask you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are the use of the things you have made some other things as you have made lawful for them so long as you are the symbols of allah and the hajj your oaths is piety
and the thing of the things you have been created so that you may ponder over what is in their bellies we have given you and know well that you may taste the most of them are grateful
god is the allhearing the allknowing
surely god is swift at reckoning
eat of the sustenance and the lawful and the beasts of prey are made to you
those who were given the book have been given the books as lawful for you
lawful for you are women besides these if you have been given the books or your brothers as muslim women are lawful for you and your wives and do not make lawful for them except those who are chaste women and do not fornication or liaison if you give
useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith and they will be among the losers in the life to come
o you who believe when you stand up to pray wash your faces and your hands up to elbows and wipe out the prayer of the infidels
you have no dying for death and am other life
but if you are sick or on a journey and on a journey or on a journey then a number of you do not find water then if you have recourse for wholesome dust or your hands or your hands seize you pass over it
god does not desire to make you his commandments clear to you but bestowed ears and eyes and hearts to you so that you may be grateful
remember the favour of allah and his noble messenger and the covenant he made you all and his noble messengers and we have made you a leader for you and all what is in the hearts of you
and fear you god surely god knows the thoughts in the breasts
o believers god suffices as witness as witness
do not make excuses you are unjust in the least of allah ’s way
be just this is closest to piety and beware of god
and fear god and god is aware of the things you do
god has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds of righteousness their deeds are wasted in them
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell
o believers remember the favours god bestowed on you when a people raised their hands against you and he restrained their hands
god is the allhearing the allknowing
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
god covenanted the people of israel and raised twelve leaders among them and said i shall verily be with you
and god said the prayer and pay the alms and obey the unbelievers and the godfearing surely god loves the gooddoers
except those who do so reject the truth after this has become clear to him
so for their breaking their compact we seal and hearts became hardened and forgotten a large portion of the advices made to them so they have been sealed
you will always hear of treachery on their part except that of a few
but you pardon them and forgive them your sins and give glory to god
verily god loves those who do good
we had taken the pledge of those also who call themselves christians
so we have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till the day of resurrection when god will inform them of what they were doing
the people of the book our apostle has come to you announcing many things you have been concealing of the book and effacing many things
and indeed the light and the book has come to you – a clear proof from allah
whereby god guides to his good pleasure and brings them out of darkness into light and guides them out of darkness into light by his will and guide them to the path that is straight
verily they are unbelievers who say the messiah son of mary is the son of maryam
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ who is the messiah marys son and blessings be upon him who is in the sight of allah ”
and for whom only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them allah only is the all knowing of all the wise
god has power over everything
say the jews and the christians we are sons of god and his beloved ones
say why then does he chastise you for your sins
no you are only mortals of you
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and all that lies between them all that lies between them
o people given the books
and there has come to you the warner of the warners
god has power over everything
and moosa said to his people “ o my people remember allah ’s favour upon you that he created me whereas before you has ruined me and indeed he has bestowed upon you the way of nooh before your lord is one of the creation ”
o my people enter the holy land which god has prescribed for you and do not turn back on your traces to turn back
they said “ o moosa
they said “ we shall never never never enter it whilst they are there so they are there ”
we shall enter it whilst they are called to it
then two men who feared god had given him to whom god had blessed him doubted and said how is it you who had been given power over every man
put you all your trust in him if you are believers
they said o moses we will never never enter so long as they are there
go you and your lord to fight them we stay here
said he my lord i rule no one except myself and my brother so distinguish between us and my brother so do not waste the way of the transgressors
said allah “ this is for forty years so do not waste the right path if they are on the earth turn towards them – and do not be waste the people of the sinners ”
so do not grieve for these the wicked people
narrate to them exactly the tale of the two sons of adam
when both of them offered a sacrifice to adam he said i will not be accepted and he will accept the one who was accepted and was not accepted faith
he said “ allah is the help of your deeds ”
o my people who believe if you raise your hand against me i will not move you to kill me
i fear god the lord of all the worlds
i desire that thou shouldest be laden with my sin and thy sin and so become an inhabitant of the fire that is the recompense of the evildoers
then the other was induced by his passion to murder his brother and he killed him and became one of the damned
then god sent a raven which scratched the ground in order to show him how he might conceal the vile body in his brother
he said woe is me
am i not even capable enough to be like this crow so
and he became one of the remorseful
and this was commanded the descendants of israel “ whoever kills a human being – and for him we had made a human being abased – and indeed we had appointed for them to be restricted above mankind and whoever saves the life of someone as if he had
whoever grows in goodness does so for himself he may take revenge from his lord
our messengers have already come to them with the clear signs then many of them do not understand
and whosoever opposes god and his messenger and the covenant shall be chastised and not being killed or is a thing they shall be robed in the land and not aught of the workers of corruption
such is their disgrace in the world and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement
but those who repent before they are subdued should know that they can not repent nor do the right
know that god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o people who believe
o believers fear god and seek the means to come to you haply so you will prosper
if all that is in the earth and the unbelievers possessed all that is on the day of resurrection they would offer it to ransom themselves from the chastisement of the burning
for them there is painful punishment
they will wish to come out of hell
for them is great deprivation
and cut off the hands of men or women who are thieves – a punishment from allah the lord of the creation
god is allpowerful and allmighty
but if one repents after his wrongdoing and reforms himself allah will incline towards him with his mercy indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
to god belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he may forgive whosoever he please and afflict whosoever he will
god has power over everything
o prophet struggle with their tongues what has been sent down to you with their tongues and do not be grieved for them and do not listen to falsehood and do not listen to you but let their faith
and among the jews distort the words out of context and say in the morning of what you call us to ”
god does not burden a soul beyond capacity
these are the people whose hearts god does not wish to purify
for them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come
who listen to falsehood and consume the unlawful
so if they come to you judge between them or decline
if they come to thee judge thou between them or decline
and if the judgement is between them equitably and no witnesses
god loves the just and boastful
and how can they make you a judge when the torah is with them in the book has deceived you as their mothers
we have sent down the book to the light of ours and light
god has made the kabah as charged with apostles and whosoever has been killed in the torah was condemned by god and his apostles
they have submitted ourselves before allah and his noble messenger and the believers and the truth is not at all grieve
but do not fear him fear me and barter not my messages away for a paltry gain
and do not exchange the faith to go away from me
and those who do not judge in accordance with what god has revealed are transgressors
and in the taurat we made it obligatory upon them that “ a life is the retribution for a life and an eye for an eye and a nose for a nose and an ear for a tooth and for a tooth and for a tooth and for a
whoso does evil shall have his own gain and whoso is slain it is against his own loss
and those who do not judge in accordance with what god has revealed are transgressors
later ages
and this is an explanation for a guidance and a mercy for the godfearing
the people of the gospel judge according to what has been revealed in it by god
and those who do not judge in accordance with what god has revealed are transgressors
we have revealed the book to you with the truth and to strengthen your heart with it and to warn the straight path
judge between them in the light of what has been revealed by god and do not follow their whims and beware of them lest they lead astray
we have indeed appointed a way to be a pattern of life
if god had pleased he could have made you one nation but he could have made you some good deeds and have made you a thing like you
so rejoice at the bargain you have made with him for he does not have the wishes of those who are righteous
then to him shall you return and he will tell you what you did
so judge between them by what is revealed by god and do not follow their whims sidestepping the truth by his words
so follow their vain desires to fight them
and judge between them according to what has been revealed by god and do not follow their whims and beware of them lest they lead you away from the path of the right path
if they turn away then know that god is sure to punish them for some of their sins and he will punish them for their sins
but most men do not understand
do they seek a judgement of the days of pagan ignorance
and who is more true than one who worships the day to do the right path
o believers do not hold jews and christians as your allies
they are allies of one another and anyone who makes them his friends is one of them and one of them is one of them
god does not show an unjust people the way
and thou seest those in whose hearts is sickness vying with one another to come to us then we fear lest they fail to understand
it may well be that god may know the faithful and they are an enemy to them
and the believers say “ are these the people who swore by allah most vehemently in their oaths that they are with you ”
all their deeds are destroyed so they are ruined
and whosoever of you turns back on his religion except those who believe and fought are in the way of god and his apostle should have been driven by men from any way of god indeed the one who does not befriend the other in his cause and god
this is the bounty of god he gives whosoever he please
god is infinite and allknowing
you do not have any friends except allah and his noble messenger and the believers who establish the prayer and pay the charity and are bowed down before allah
and whosoever takes the faith of god and his messenger and god is the allmighty the allcompassionate
o believers do not make friends with those who mock and make friends with those who mock at your own souls and who do not believe
and fear god if you are believers
when you call upon prayer they make fun of it this is because they are a people who do not understand
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
say shall i tell you of a recompense with god worse than that
those who were condemned by god and on whom fell his wrath and those who were turned to apes and swine and those who worship the powers of evil they are gone astray from the right path
and when they meet you they say we believe
when they come to you they say we believe but when they are called to him they are alone
god knows what they hide in their hearts
and you will see among them many of them vying in sin and enmity and disobedience to the throats and you see the deniers of the astray
evil are the acts they commit
why do not their rabbis and priests prohibit them from talking of sinful things and from devouring unlawful gain
evil are the acts they commit
the jews said bound are the hands of god
fettered are their hands and they are cursed for what they have said
nay but god chooses of his hands and he has increased them in flight before knowledge
and what has been sent down to you from your lord will increase many of them in insolence and unbelief
so we have caused enmity and hatred among them which will last till the day of resurrection
as often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by god
yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land but god does not love those who are corrupt
if the people of the book had believed and feared we would surely have absolved them of their sins and admitted them to gardens of delight
had they really been commanded to be the people of the book would have been opened up the earth and have found all what was sent down before them from their lord they would not have been commanded to follow the path of hell and from their lord
and many of them are the most wicked indeed
and keep following what is sent down to you from your lord o people
o prophet announce what has reached you from your lord for if you do not you will not have delivered his message
god will protect thee from men
god does not show the unrighteous the way
say o people of the book you do not stand on anything till you stand on positive proof and do not stand on your own selves
and what has been sent down to you from your lord but many of them are ungodly
do not grieve for the infidels
and those who believe and the jews and the sabians and the christians in fact any one who does good deeds and will have no fear or regret
and we took compact with the children of israel and we sent messengers to them
whensoever they came to them they disbelieved in that which they had not denied and because of what they used to mock at encompassed them
and they supposed there should be no trial but blind they were and deaf
then god thereafter turns towards him god is allknowing and allwise
then turned away and god sees everything they do
verily they are unbelievers who say the messiah son of mary is god and the unbelievers
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
whoso associates with god anything has surely forbidden to god a far place declare the fire
the iniquitous will have none to help them
they are unbelievers who say god is the third of three
god there is no god but one god the omnipotent
if they refrain not from what they say there shall afflict those of them that disbelieve a painful chastisement
will they not repent and pray his forgiveness and turn to him
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
the christ son of mary was but an apostle the apostle already come to him
he is in the lap of one that abases
behold how we make clear the signs to them then behold how they perverted are
say then why do you serve apart from god that which can not profit you or do you harm
but god is allhearing and allknowing
say o people of the book do not wrongfully and your wrongfully have more not in your religion
he led astray many a people astray and did not rightly guide them
cursed were disbelievers among the children of israel by david who refused to believe and were cursed by the tongue of dawud and sulaiman and because of their disobedience
they were addicted to sin already
evil are the acts they commit
you can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels
vile it was what they sent ahead of them so that gods indignation came upon them and torment will they suffer an eternity
if god had willed they would never have believed in him and what had been sent down to him they would not have believed in it and had they followed him and the prophet had been made their affair
but most of them are averse from them
you will certainly find the jews and the polytheists as the polytheists as friends of them and you will find the closest in friendship to the muslims and the muslims and the muslims will be victorious
in fact both are worthy of talking foolish and those who went astray
and when they listen to what has been sent down to the messenger thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of the truth they recognize
they will say “ our lord
we believe in the truth and make us witness over the witnesses
“ and what is the matter with us that we should not believe in allah and this truth which has come to us and we hope that our lord will admit us along with the righteous ”
god will reward them for saying so with gardens where streams flow by where they will live for ever
this is the recompense of those who do good
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell
o believers do not forbid the good things god has made lawful for you and do not transgress
god does not love transgressors
eat of the sustenance and the lawful of beasts and the food of god has provided you
and fear god in whom you believe
god does not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but he does take you to task for deeds which your hearts have done and allah does not take you for oaths
and if the two separate yourselves made it male is like brothers female believing in them and one of the other fight must not befriend the other and feed such a share of the night must inherit onethird but if he has set on them so that they do
but if you are sick or have ailment of the scalp preventing the shaving of hair then offer expiation by fasting
this is the expiation for an eye
so does god make his signs clear to you haply you will be grateful
o believers wine and arrowshuffling idols and diviningarrows are an abomination some of satans work so avoid it
you may haply prosper
satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling and to divert you from the remembrance of god and prayer
will you then desist
obey god and the prophet and beware
if you turn away the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
but those who believe and do righteous deeds those who believe and do the right will have gardens of paradise before their lord and the godfearing and are godfearing
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
o you who believe god will surely try you with the game that you take with your hands or your lances in order to know who fear
whoso thereafter commits transgression there awaits him a painful chastisement
o you who believe when you were on the day of resurrection we had been oppressed before you and they were few and we have passed away from you as well within the breasts of those who had been few yet they had been forbidden for they were in
lawful for you are all game of the water for your food so that it may be your flocks and your food may benefit them
but unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage
fear god before whom you have to gather in the end
god has made the kabah the sacred house a means of support for food and the sacrificial animals with sacred house and consecrated cattle so that you may understand not
god is severe in requital for the sins of god and his apostle and the light is also benevolence and god is compassionate and kind
it is only for the messenger to deliver the manifest message
and allah knows what you conceal and what you disclose
say o men of understanding obey the good things you use of men
so fear god o men possessed of minds haply so you will prosper
o believers do not ask about things which if made known to you may vex you
remember the way of god to bring a far astray
but god wills to perfect his light however the evil deeds you may dislike it and god is forbearing
indeed the bondmen of the most gracious is most merciful upon the bondmen
a people before you questioned concerning them then disbelieved in them
god has not sanctioned baheerah or saibah waseelah or ham the unbelievers fabricate lies of god for an unbelieving people
but most of them do not understand
and when it is said to them come towards what god has revealed they say sufficient for us is what we found our fathers doing doing
o believers look after your own souls and do not nullify your eyes that they may be sent back to the right path
o believers when you contract a witness between you and bring others witnesses to it
if you are in doubt of it you will not be able to draw up relatives after the death approaches weary of seeking goodness and if it is harmful only they knew who are the people of the book and the witnesses in which we have no doubt about
we shall surely be sinners in the past but we should have been more
if it transpires they have concealed the truth two of those who are immediately concerned should take their place and take them in place of ease and take their place and know that they are the unjust
if we should take away we shall surely be unjust
this is more suitable than their bearing testimony as they wish or they wish to kill their bearing testimony as they have no hope in the past but it is sinful
fear god and hearken god may well be with the last day
god does not show an unjust people the way
the day when god shall gather the messengers and say what answer were you given
they will say we know not
they will say god knows the secrets unknown
when god said o jesus son of mary he said o mary
when the son of mary is cited as an enemy to him he said behold thy people and he is in the hand of those who are upright and do not know
remember when i supported him from the spirit of mine and was bestowed on you when you said “ o my people remember me i taught you the divine revelation that i read my book ” whereas when you were recited to you and your mother and your mother
remember the name of god when i have wisdom to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are the truthful
and when the disbelievers came to them with the clear signs they said “ why did you not believe in what you yourselves do not bring you a clear sign ”
and when i inspired the disciples through jesus to believe in me
they said we hear and obey thee god the way of thy lord
when the disciples said o jesus son of mary could your lord send down for us a table laid with food he said
they said we desire that we should eat of it and our hearts be at rest and that we may know that thou hast spoken true to us and that we may be among its witnesses
and when the noble messengers said “ o our lord send down a table spread from heaven ” – so that it may be a sign from you and from the earth – a sign from you – and from you – a sign for us – a day
give us our daily bread for you are the best of all givers of food
and god said i shall send it down to you but if any of you disbelieve after this we shall inflict such punishment on him as punishment
and when allah will say “ o eisa the son of maryam
and he said all praise be to you
i know not what is in your heart and what do you know
“ and indeed i do not know what is in your heart if you do ”
you are the allmighty the allwise
i was told them ask where did this see what you worship me
and i was told them a witness against them
and yet you did not tell them yet you were rebellious
if thou chastisest them they are thy servants if thou forgivest them thou art the allmighty the allwise
god said this is the day the truthful shall be profited by their truthfulness
for them await gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever the recompense of the gooddoers
god will accept them and they will be gratified in obeying him
for gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and gods are the power over all things
all praise be to god who created the heavens and the earth and ordained darkness and light
yet the unbelievers make the others equal of their lord
it is he who created you from clay then determined a term for you and a term is fixed with him
then you will not deny it
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal
and whenever a sign comes to them from the signs of their lord they turn away from it
in fact they denied the truth when it came to them so now they will come to know soon
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them which will not return to them
and we indeed destroyed the earth many a generation we did not create them – in fact they used to share before their wealth
and we destroyed them all together but we set several examples and appointed for every time
and had we sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him they would have been taught you some of what they did not know if the qur’an had known to you they would have said “ this is nothing but a clear
they say how is it no angel was sent down to him
and had we sent down the word continuously to you therefore the matter would have been decided ”
and had we made it an angel yet assuredly we would have made him as a blazing fire for those who associate with him
and indeed the noble messengers before you were mocked at but their mockery ruined the mockers themselves
say travel in the land and see what happened to those who disbelieved
say to whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth
he has prescribed grace for himself
there is no doubt about you when he will gather you together on the day of resurrection which is certain to come
and all things are within the night
he is allhearing and allknowing
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ shall i take refuge with him who is the one who feeds and does not need to eat ”
say i have been commanded to be the first of them that surrender be not thou of the idolaters
say truly i fear if i should rebel against my lord the chastisement of a dreadful day
whosoever is spared that day will surely have mercy shown to him and will admit him into his mercy
if god sends you harm there is no way to you but if he forsake the good things and if he sends you some good fortune then surely he is oft forgiving most merciful
and if good reaches you they all of them we have indeed given you a great reward
he is the omnipotent over his bondmen and he is the wise the all knowing
ask them what is great most vital as evidence
god is witness between you and me and god is a witness over everything
and it is this the divine revelation that “ i may warn you with it ”
do you really bear witness there are other gods with god
say verily he is the only god and i am clear of what you associate with him
those to whom we have given the book recognize it as they recognize their sons
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
surely the evildoers do not prosper
and on the day when we shall assemble them on that day all together – all of them – proclaim to those who ascribe partners to allah assume as a partner to him
then they shall be pitched into it they said they are our lord we are the idolaters
observe how they lied against themselves and how they lost the things they fabricated
and among them are some who listen to you but we have put a covering on their hearts so that they fail to understand it and a deafness appears in their ears
though they see the sign they will not believe it to be a sign to them and will not believe
and when they see you they are promised and the disbelievers say “ this is nothing but fables of antiquity he has invented invented which these are dictated only a manifest sorcery ”
and they forbid others from believing in it and themselves keep away from it
but they ruin none but themselves and do not understand
and when it is said to them “ do not believe in the fire they will say “ we have heard if you see them – we were sent down to the signs of our lord ” – and we were being stubborn upon it
no indeed but that which they were hiding has now become clear to them
if they had desired to go forth they would not have been insolent against themselves they would surely have been devising
and they said “ there is no other life except our life of this world and we are not to be raised ”
and if you see when they are placed before their lord he will say “ is this not real the truth
they will answer indeed by our lord
he shall say then taste the chastisement for your unbelief
they will call the meeting with god who will not believe in the world to come
till the hour comes upon them unawares they will say alas we neglected it and carry their burdens on their backs
indeed what an evil judgement they impose
as for the life of this world it is nothing but a frolic and frivolity
do you not understand
we know what they say distresses you
they are liars indeed
he will restore what he will
messengers indeed were cried lies before thee but they cried lies to and assuredly they were the messengers
and the disbelievers said “ we have appointed heirs of the life of this world and the help of allah ” they do not help each other against the angels and the disbelievers conspired to ruin is for their disobedience and the word is proved true upon the noble
the histories of apostles that we relate to you are meant to strengthen your heart
and if their turning away are distressful for thee why if thou canst seek a hole in the earth or a ladder in heaven and bring him a sign but god knows everything
if god had willed he could have brought them all to the right path
only they will respond who can hear
surely god he gives life to the dead then he will raise the dead then to him they will be returned
they say how is it no sign been sent down upon him from his lord
say god certainly has power to send down a sign but most of them know not
and there is not a thing that shall be raised between them two mountains as anchors in the earth and in between them
there is nothing that we have left out from recording
we shall gather all together then they will be returned towards their lord
and those who disbelieve in our signs are deaf dumb and deaf dumb dwelling in the shadows
god sends whosoever he wills astray and leads whom he will to the straight path
say what think you if god should bring you the chastisement of the hour of the hour arrives will you call upon any other than god if you speak truly
no he will remove the affliction you call upon him and he will if he will
do not associate any one with god or he has begotten a witness
we had also sent apostles before you to their people of their regions to the might who were humble to god is severe punishment
then why did they not submit when our punishment came upon them
but their hearts were hardened and satan made things they were doing look attractive to them
so when they forgot the advices made to them we opened the gates of all things for them to the extent that when they were rejoicing for what they had received we seized them suddenly hence they remained dejected
thus were the wicked people rooted out of existence to the last
all praise be to allah lord of all the worlds
say what think you if god seizes your hearing and sight and sets a seal upon your hearts who is there to eat and who is god but one god
behold how we turn about the signs haply they will understand
say imagine if the punishment of god were to come unawares or openly who will perish but the evildoers
we never send apostles but to convey happy tidings and to warn
but as for the believers who do deeds of righteousness he shall have no fear or regret
but those who deny our revelations are the people of the left hand will be drowned
say i do not say to you i possess the treasuries of god i know not the unseen
i follow only what is revealed to me
say can a blind man and a man equal
will you not reflect
and warn therewith those who fear they shall be mustered to their lord they shall be assigned to him no protector but him they shall be helped
and he has a reminder to the godfearing
do not turn away those who supplicate their lord morning and evening seeking his magnificence
and there is no way of reproach against the gooddoers
if you drive them away you will only be unjust
and similarly we have sent down a man amongst us to men as a child whereas the good deeds are you wonder at the one of us
does not god know who are the grateful
and when they came to them they say “ peace ”
your lord has prescribed grace for himself so that if one of you commits evil out of ignorance then surely god is forgiving and kind
that is how we requite the sinners
say i have been forbidden to worship those whom you worship other than god and of all the worlds
if i do not follow your caprices or else i had gone astray
say i am on a clear sign from my lord
but what you wish to be hastened is not within my power
he has brought down the truth and the false deities
he is the best of all providers
say if what you wish to be hastened were in my power all matters between you and me would have been settled god knows the evildoers
he has the keys of the unknown
he knows what is in land and sea not a leaf falls but he knows them
he is not niggardly nor are they able to do aught
and it is not an atoms weight of an atom on the earth nor is there hidden from those who are in a clear book
he knows you are the first part of the night and how good you do not understand
then to him you will be returned when he will tell you what you did
then to him you will be returned when he will tell you what you did
he is the omnipotent over his servants
when death comes to one of you our messengers take away his soul and they are not to err
then they are restored to god their protector the true and gods the true the promise is true
surely his is the judgement and he is swift at reckoning
say who delivers you from the shadows of land and sea and be grateful to him who delivers you from the land and from his way
say god delivers you from them and every calamity
and yet you ascribe partners to him
say he is able to send retribution from the skies above you or from the skies one to eat some other land or confound you with divisions among you and give ear and some of the taste the dead
behold how we turn about the signs haply they will understand
they rejected the signs of god and the lies
say i am not a warden over you
every tiding has its time appointed you will surely know
and you will see them argue with our signs except the people who believe in our signs until they engage in another topic
the devil has indeed made you forget not ” then the unjust say “ do not bring you an unjust people ”
this is no more than reminder for the godfearing
leave alone those alone who have made a sport and frolic of their faith and have ears and forget their faith
and warn their own account we shall not be raised up and every soul shall be pledged for what it has earned and thou shall not be able to do aught on his own behalf and every soul shall be pledged for what it has earned
they are no other guardian but him
those who are warned of their deeds will give over to the people of hell and for them is a disgraceful punishment
say “ shall we call besides allah as a host can say to us can we be the same our fathers upon us ”
say god guides to the path of the lord of all the worlds
and perform the prayer and fear him it is to him that you will be mustered
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision
the day he will say be it will be
the judgement is certain to come
the day the trumpet blast is sounded no one will carry in the terror
he knows the hidden and the visible
he is the allsubtle the allaware
and remember when ibrahim said to his father paternal uncle azar “ what you appoint idols as gods
i certainly find you and your people in manifest error
and likewise we showed ibrahim the entire kingdom of the heavens and the earth and so that he be of those who believe as eyewitnesses
when night outspread over him he saw a star and said this is my lord
but when the star set abraham said i love not those that wane
when the moon saw the eclipsed
but even as the moon set abraham said if my lord had not shown me the way i would surely have gone astray
when azar saw the sun rise all resplendent he said my lord is surely this and the greatest of them all
but the sun also set and abraham said o my people i am through with those you associate with god
i have turned my face to him who originated the heavens and the earth a man of pure faith i am not of the idolaters
his people argued and he said do you not guide me to the right path
he has guided me and i fear not what you associate with him
so plan your move and call him to task
“ none knows the hidden from my lord except him who is the knowledge of the unseen ”
and allah has sent down the proof regarding the matters you do not dispute with you – and i fear those you associate with him regarding allah that which you do not have any proof
tell me whose way is the way of peace if you have the knowledge
those who believe and do righteous deeds those are the prosperers
this is the argument we gave to abraham against his people
we exalt whosoever we please in rank by degrees
indeed your lord only is the wise the all knowing ”
we therefore gave him the divine revelations and the family of lot whom we favoured the judgement and made the prophets and made the devils who turned disbelievers among the descendants of israel
we have indeed strayed into every group
and noah had believed and the seed of abraham and he said surely he is guided to his honoured guests
thus do we reward the good
or we guided zakaria or yahya john or eisa and elias all that is on the right path
and ismael ishmael and yasa’a elisha and yunus jonah and lut lot and to each one during their times we destroyed them on their dwellings uninhabited in position
as we did some of their fathers and progeny and brethren and chose them and showed them the right path
this is gods guidance he gives among his creatures whom he will
if they had associated others with him surely vain would have been all they did
those to whom we gave the book and the law and the prophethood
if they do not believe in it we have given them a law and reject these are not given them
those were the people who were guided by god so follow their way
say i ask of you no wage for this
it is only a warning for all mankind
they measured not god with his true measure when they said god has not sent down aught on any mortal
say who has sent down the book to moses for men a guidance and a light and as a guidance for men who has sent the book to be a clear proof
he said “ you have no right to what you have been commanded ”
leave them to their falsehoods
and remember this is the book which we have sent down confirming the earlier revelations and preserving them from change and corruption
and those who believe in the life to come shall believe in the hereafter
and who does greater evil than he who forges against me a lie against god and says god has not revealed anything to says if only i am like that of the evildoers
if you see when they are in nigh the agony of death with the angels thrusting forward their hands saying yield up your souls this day you will suffer ignominious punishment for uttering lies about god and rejecting his signs with arrogance
you have come before us as we created you like yourselves like you
shattered lie your ties with them now and gone are the claims you made
indeed it is allah who splits the grain and the seed it is he who brings forth living from the dead and it is he who brings forth dead from the living such is allah so where are you reverting
that then is god so whither do you stray
he splits the sky into dawn and has made the night for a repose and the sun and moon for a reckoning
this is the dispensation of the mighty allknowing god
and waymarks and by the stars by his command
distinct have we made our signs for those who recognise
he is one of the jinni and rebelled against his lords command
there is a fixed time for you
distinct have we made our signs for those who recognise
and it is he who sends down water from the skies and brings forth every kind that grows the green foliage the grain lying close the date palm trees with clusters of dates and the gardens of grapes
look at the fruits how they appear on the trees and they ripen
indeed in this are signs for the people who believe
and he created them and the associates of that they associate with him
purity and supremacy are to him above their ascribing of partners to him
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision he is not worthy of power to perfect desire and only god the supreme majesty
he is the real creator allknowing
he is god your lord
he is god there is no god but he
he is the creator of all things and he alone has the power over all things
so serve what is in your lord and he is the guardian over everything
eyes do not encompass him – and all eyes are within his domain he is the most subtle the fully aware control knowledge
he is allpenetrating allaware
to you have come signs from your lord and the light of understanding
whoever grows in goodness does so for himself and whoever does so it is for himself and for himself to his own loss
i am not a guardian over you
so we distinguish the signs and the signs clear that haply they will understand
possibly you may risk your life by grieving o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him for them
follow thou what has been revealed to thee and follow thou surmise and have no protector apart from the idolaters
had he willed they would not have been idolaters
we have not appointed you their guardian nor are you as warden over them
abuse not the limits set by god and they begin to revile your evil out by his grace
every nation we have paid in full for what it has done
then to their lord shall be returned when he will tell them what they did
and they swore by allah vehemently in their oaths that if any sign came to them they will not believe in it or even then the punishment would have come upon them
say signs are with god
even though all the signs came to them they may not believe
we shall turn their hearts and their eyes for they do not believe them at all and we leave them in them to wander perplexed in bewilderment
and had we sent down the angels to them and the dead should have come to them they would not believe unless god willed and they would not have believed unless all
but most of them know not
thus do we have appointed enemies to every prophet and disputed each other and satans every one of them
so that they may not be able to seek each other during them
but if your lord had willed they would not have done so
leave them to their falsehoods
and that the hearts of those who do not believe in the world to come may incline towards it and that they may gain the message to be sent down
“ so shall i seek the reward for you ”
those to whom we have given the book know it has been the truth from their lord
so be not a sceptic
the word of your lord is proved true upon the word of your lord the almighty the all knowing
there is no changing the word of god
he is allhearing and allknowing
if you follow the majority of people on the earth they will lead you astray from the path of god for they follow only conjecture and surmise
your lord surely knows who strays from his path and he knows those who are guided the right way
eat only that over which the name of god has been pronounced if you truly believe in his commands
and what is the matter with you that you should not eat of that over which allah has forbidden you whereas indeed allah has forbidden unless you are forced into his commands and allah has forbidden you do not like any beast except him so do not eat the
surely many men mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge
your lord certainly knows the transgressors
forsake the outward sin and the inward surely the earners of sin shall be recompensed for what they have earned
do not eat of that over which gods name has not been pronounced for that would amount to exceeding the limits of law
the satans inspire their friends to dispute with you
and if you obey them you will surely become like him
can he who was lifeless to whom we gave life and gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men be like him who is used to darkness from which he can never emerge
similarly the deeds of disbelievers are made to appear good to them
thus came the city to city city that was evildoing and now it was as the people they were in it
yet they ruin none but themselves and do not understand
and when a sign comes to them they say we will not believe till what gods apostles had been given comes to us
god knows best where to direct his messages
it is allah ’s punishment for the disbelievers is severe punishment
and whomever allah wills to guide towards his islam so he sends astray so that he sends him astray – thereupon a cloud spread wide open enemy like him
that is how god sets seal upon the unbelievers
this is the straight path of your lord
distinct have we made our signs for those who reflect
for them is an abode of peace with their lord
he will be their defender as reward for what they did
and allah has illustrated men – a number of mankind – so he has chosen a group among mankind – and among mankind – the one whom allah will take heed for themselves and do not fear the unjust
thus do we place some sinners over others as requital for their deeds
o you assembly of jinns and men did not apostles come to you from among you communicating my verses to you bringing warnings of this your day of doom
they will answer we bear witness to our sins
they shall say we bear witness against ourselves
they were deluded by the present life and they bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
that is because thy lord would never destroy the cities unjustly while their inhabitants were heedless
did you not see that your lord knows all their deeds
your lord is allsufficient merciful
if he wills he can take you away and bring other people between you as he produced you from the seed of another people
the promise that was made to you is bound to be fulfilled it is not in your power to defeat it
say o my people act according to your station i am acting and certainly you will know who are the even path and who is the liar
and they said “ allah creates a portion for the earth – and they are their small and this is purer for you so do not know ”
so what is for their associates reaches not god and what is for god reaches their associates
how ill they judge
thus the idolaters have been theirs lost their way and that those have misled them yet they have been forging
if god had so willed they would never have done so
leave them to their falsehoods
they said “ we are a large number and the guilty of protectors ”
and the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden the dead use of these cattle is forbidden and use of their cattle and use of their cattle
they do not pronounce the name of god over them
he will punish them for what they fabricate
and they say these cattle and these cattle are consecrated
if he is slain here in the wombs of the dead will have no share in the least
god will punish them for what they assert
he is allknowing and allwise
indeed ruined are those who slay their children out of senseless ignorance and forbid the sustenance which allah has bestowed upon them in order to fabricate lies against allah indeed allah will surely perish the supreme success
they are lost and can not find the way
it is he who produces gardens trellised and untrellised palmtrees and crops diverse in produce olives pomegranates like each to each and each unlike to each
eat of the fruits of their fruits when they fructify and pay the due thereof on the day and do not be extravagant and be does not love unbelievers
and he made the earth a base
o believers eat of the good things god has given you for food and do not exceed the bounds he is prodigal against the gooddoers
he is your open enemy
eight couples two of sheep of goats two
ask them which has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the females carry in their wombs
produce the sanction if you are truthful
and there are two sisters two females one of oxen two sheep and one of goats
or do you think that god will make it hear
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie in order that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge
surely god does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust
say i do not ask of any one for a month say it is only a ear then a part of what is in it and a little do you find other than god who eats thereof your majesty is fair in the heavens and the earth
but if one is constrained to eat of these without craving or reverting to it then surely your lord is forgiving and kind
we made unlawful for the jews all animals with claws or nails and the fat of the oxen and sheep except that on their backs or their intestines or which remains attached to their bones
thus we recompensed them for their unbelief and we had knowledge of the unknown
if they cry lies to the mercy of your lord and his mercy allembracing allknowing
the idolaters say if god had so willed we would not have associated others with him nor would our fathers have been idolaters nor would we have forbidden anything
those before them had also denied
ask them have you any knowledge then display it
you follow nothing but conjecture and are nothing but liars
say to them indeed allah is the most honourable the all knowing
if he willed he would surely have guided all together
say bring your witnesses those who testify god has forbidden this
and if they testify bear not witness with them and do not follow the wishes of those who deny our signs and do not believe in the hereafter and do not follow the way of those who deny our signs and become transgressors
tell them come i will read out what your lord has made binding on you that you may be good to them and slay the idolaters and not your children who do not kill any indecency outward or inward surely we shall not abandon your faults and men for
he has written by doing so he makes clear to them the first time future
god has forbidden the kaaba unjustly several needy persons
that then he has charged you with haply you will be godfearing
and do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner until he is of age
so measure not with all full and magnify god for his true measure
and when you speak be just even if it should be to a near kinsman and fulfil the covenant
and fulfil gods covenant
that then he has charged you with haply you will be godfearing
this is the straight path
and that it is he who has spread you out of your land and has set no witnesses over you
that then he has charged you with haply you will be godfearing
and we gave the book to moosa he bestows on whomever he wills and a guidance and a mercy and glad tidings to the muslims
this is the book free of doubt and involution a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil
and when it is said to him “ follow the means of proximity – you will find mercy ”
lest you say the book that was sent before was meant only for two groups we were not aware of their teachings
or had the book been sent down to us we would have been more rightly guided than they
these are the signs of your lord and a guidance and a mercy for you
and who does greater evil than he who denies the signs of god and turns away from them
we shall punish those severely who turn away a requital indeed for having turned aside
what are they waiting for – except that the angels come upon them or your lord ’s punishment comes
the day when certain signs appear from your lord to appear or he never believed the embracing of any thing to be done or some good to one who did not come to faith
say watch and wait we too are waiting
as for those who have created schisms in their order and formed different sects you have no concern with them
then to god shall tell them what they were doing
whosoever brings a good deed he shall have ten like it
whoever brings evil will be repaid except with the same extent and whoever brings evil – so it is they who are the unjust will not be wronged
say my lord has guided me to a straight path a straight path a right religion the creed of abraham a man of pure faith he was no idolater
say my prayer my ritual sacrifice my living my dying all belongs to god the lord of all being
no associate has he
even so i have been commanded and i am the first of those that surrender
say shall i search for another lord apart from god when he is the only lord of all things
each soul earns what it earns as indeed each soul is pledged to what it does
that no soul laden bears the load of another
then to your lord shall you return and he will tell you what you did
and do not spread turmoil in the earth after its reform and he has made you successors in the land and do not like those who are righteous
surely thy lords retribution is swift yet he is swift in retribution and surely forgiving and kind
alif lam mim sad
this book has been sent down to you so do not hesitate to warn the unbelievers through it and remind the faithful
and there has come to you a book which has a reminder for the believers
follow what has been revealed to you by your lord and do not follow any other lord apart from him
little do you reflect
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
our might came upon it at night and they took their ease in the noontide
so they uttered nothing when our punishment came to them except that they said indeed we were evildoers
so we shall question those unto whom a message was sent and we shall question the envoys
we shall recount their deeds to them with knowledge for we were never absent and saw all they did
and the weighing will be just on that day
then those whose deeds are heavier in the balance will find fulfilment
but those whose deeds are lighter in the scale shall perish for violating our signs
we settled you on the earth and provided means of livelihood for you in it
how little are the thanks you offer
and indeed we created you then designed you and then ordered the angels “ prostrate before adam ”
so the angels bowed themselves all together
said allah “ what prevented you that you did not prostrate when i commanded you ”
said he i am better than he thou createdst me of fire and him thou createdst of clay
said allah “ therefore exit from here ”
go and away you are one of the damned
said he respite me till the day they shall be raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
said he now for thy perverting me i shall surely sit in ambush for them on thy straight path
then i shall come on them from the front and behind right and left and you will not find among them many who would give thanks
said he depart without days – so go it to you
those of them who follow you i shall fill up hell with all of you
and we said adam both your spouse live in the garden and eat your fill wheresoever you like but do not approach this tree or you will become iniquitous
satan has already told them that satan was your acknowledged enemy so that you may become immortals
and he swore to them truly i am for you a sincere adviser
and led them to the tree by deceit
so both ate of its fruit and their hands and their shameful parts revealed to them so they both ate the food – their shame became manifest to them
and their lord said to them did i not forbid you this tree and i told you that satan was your open enemy
they said “ our lord
if you do not forgive us and have mercy upon us we shall certainly be lost
said he get you down each of you an enemy to each is a fixed term
said he therein you shall live and therein you shall die and from there you shall be brought forth
o descendants of adam
and the signs of the most gracious may haply take heed for yourselves and fear allah you may understand
o sons of adam let not satan beguile you as he did your parents out of eden and made them disrobe to expose their disgrace to them
surely he sees you he and his tribe from where you see them not
we have made the devils the friends of those who do not believe
who say we found our fathers a way and we found our fathers upon them
they said god has knowledge of everything
you impute such lies to god as you do not know
say my lord has commanded justice
and pray to your people full of pride and hostility
therefore pray unto your lord as should be those who prostrate
for you will be reverted back to what you were when created first
and some of them were guided by god that guides not the people who are wilfully unjust
o sons of adam attire yourselves at every time of worship eat and drink but do not be wasteful for god does not like the prodigals
ask them who forbids you attire that god has given to his creatures and the good things that he has provided
say these on the day of resurrection shall be exclusively for those who believed in this present life
that is how we explain our signs distinctly for those who comprehend
say my lord has forbidden the indecencies the inward and the outward and sin and the inward and that you have no knowledge against god such as you know not
every people have a certain term when their appointed term comes they can not make it back
o descendants of adam when apostles come to you from among you who convey my messages and have aided him with the clear signs and have no fear or regret
but those who deny our revelations are the people of hell they will remain in it forever
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
such as these our angels come to draw out violently they turn to us
he shall say enter among nations that passed away before you jinn and mankind into nations
and when they will see every nation it has come on the sinners
every one of them shall be pitched into the perverse of the angels shall be the inhabitants of the fire
give us the double punishment of fire and put us to the torment of hell
and allah has created a very proof for you do not know
and the preceding groups will say to the latter “ so you too were no better than us therefore taste the punishment for what you have done ”
and those who denied our signs are the people of the fire – the gates of the heavens will not be opened nor will they enter paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle
that is how we requite the sinners
there is a covering of fire for them and a blaze
that is how we requite the iniquitous
but those who believe and do righteous deeds we charge not any soul save according to their capacity are the inhabitants of paradise they shall live there forever
we shall strip away all rancour that is in their breasts and underneath them rivers flowing and they will say praise belongs to god who guided us unto this had god not guided us we would never have been guided
all praise be to god who has removed all care of everything
it was not for us to guide the people of the right path
the apostles of our lord had been made lawful for them and made clear proofs to us
and the cry shall resound this is paradise you have inherited as meed for your deeds
the inhabitants of paradise they have made their inhabitants abased us we found our fathers upon us
have you also found the promise of your lord to be true
and they shall say a curse each other shall be on the evildoers
who obstruct others from the way of god and believe not in the world to come are in the life to come
between the two men and the veil and the ramparts are men knowing each women who find peace be upon their right hand
they are the people of paradise abiding in it forever the reward of the highest place their illiyin
and when their eyes turned towards the people of hell they will say “ our lord do not put us along with the unjust ”
and they say “ what is your opinion – if the men do not believe ”
did they not recognise those who are all the people of the fire
enter paradise no fear upon you nor shall you sorrow
and the inmates of hell will call to the residents of hell they will call to the inmates of paradise pour a little water
they will answer god has verily forbidden these to those who denied the truth
who made those who have made the covenant with those who have made the life of this world and pastime and address them we shall soon make them the way they have their confronting
and we brought to them a book making clear testimony to them a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
do you fear that he may bring it to life again
the day when our lords messengers came with the truth they said we shall surely believe in it
what is there any intercessors that we have provided the former death and we shall not be able to intercede for us
they are the people who put themselves into ruin and they lost all that they used to fabricate
surely your lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six days then sat himself upon the throne covering the day with the night it pursues urgently and the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by his command
surely it is he who are the first and the angels come to watch
blessed be god the lord of all the worlds
pray to your lord crying humbly and softly
he does not love the iniquitous
and diminish not the goods of the people and do not mischief in the earth working corruption
the blessing of god is at hand for those who do good
he looses the winds bearing good tidings before his mercy and he sets the winds that stir up and he withholds his bounty abounding
and we sent down water from the sky with it revived thereby we revived a dead city with it and therewith revive the earth after it is not for us
so will be the resurrection
that they may take a warning
and the good land its vegetation comes forth by the leave of its lord and the corrupt it comes forth but scantily
so we distinguish the signs for a people who understand
we sent noah to his people and he said o my people i have indeed sent a noble messenger towards the people of the world
he said o my people worship god for you have no other god but he
“ that you must worship allah indeed your lord there is the punishment of the calamitous day upon you ”
the leaders of his people said “ indeed we see you in open error ”
he said o my people there is no straying in me – i am in fact a noble messenger from the lord of the creation ”
i bring to you the messages of my lord
god has knowledge of everything
what do you wonder that a reminder from your lord should come to you by the lips of a man from among you
they rejected him as lies
but we saved him and those with him in the ark and drowned those who denied our signs
they were certainly wicked
and to ad their brother hood he said o my people serve god you have no god other than he will you not be godfearing
the chiefs of his people who were infidels replied we find you full of folly and a liar to boot
he said o my people i have not been sent by the lord of all being
i bring to you the messages of my lord i am your adviser sincere faithful
do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your lord through a man who is one of you and warns you to take heed for yourselves and fear god you might be treated with mercy
remember the way he made you leaders after the people of noah and gave you a greater increase in your stature
remember the favours of god you may haply be blessed
they said “ have you come to us in order that we should worship only allah and abandon those whom our ancestors worshipped
then bring upon us what you predict for us if you are a man of truth
he said “ the punishment and the wrath of your lord have fallen upon you or descend upon you ”
what do you dispute with me concerning names yourselves have named you and your fathers touching the names yourselves have named you and your fathers touching the fathers touching which you have no sanction
and they denied the truth when it came to them so god has brought down the clear authority
so wait for what is to come i am waiting with you
so we delivered him and those with him by a mercy from us and we cut off the last remnant of those who cried lies to our signs and were not believers
and to thamood their brother salih he said o my people serve god
he said o my people worship god for you have no other god but he
clear proof has come to you from your lord and the light of understanding
“ and this is the shecamel of allah will provide you a sign for you – so leave her graze upon and do not touch her with an evil intention for an imminent punishment will reach you ”
and god destroyed the ad and thamood
remember gods bounties and do not mischief in the earth working corruption
the chiefs among the people who were arrogant towards the weaker ones among them who believed asked do you really know that saleh has been sent by his lord
they said “ yes he is the most gracious the most merciful ”
the proud ones said “ we deny what you have believed in ”
then they hamstrung the shecamel and rebelled against the command of their lord and said bring upon us what you threaten us if you speak the truth
therefore the earthquake seized them so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes
saleh turned away from them and said o my people i conveyed to you the message of my lord and warned you but you do not like those who wish you well but do not wish to be ruined
and we sent lut – when he said to his people “ o my people
“ you lustfully go towards men instead of women
in fact you are a people who exceed the limits ”
and the answer of his people was only that they said expel the folk of lot from your city they are folk that keep themselves clean
so we saved him and his family except his wife who was destined to stay behind
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
so witness the end of sinners
and to midian their brother shuaib he said o my people serve god
he said o my people worship god for you have no other god but he
o my people have come to you with a clear proof from your lord so give in full measure and weigh justly on the straight balance
and do not unjustly devour the property of each other and do not unjustly devour the wealth of each community and do not unjustly devour the secrets of others without right to your own hands own property
this is best for you if you believe
do not sit in ambush to intimidate and divert from the path of god those who are despondent of his way and who show him the way of god
remember the day when you were few and he increased your numbers
see how was the end of the workers of corruption
if there is a party of you who believe in me and if there be no harm of you or god will judge between us for he is the best of judges
he is the best of all providers
the proud leaders of his people said “ o shuaib we swear we will banish you out of our land and are with you from our land ” they said “ o shuaib
they said “ what even if we detest it ”
we should have forged against god a lie if we returned into your creed after god delivered us from it
our lord embraces all things in his knowledge
in god we put our trust
our lord give true deliverance between us and our people thou art the best of deliverers
and the disbelieving leaders of his people said “ if you obey shuaib you will surely be unjust ”
therefore the earthquake seized them so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes
they were the people who denied the truth by their lord as though they were frightened asses
they are the people who deny the truth and will be lost
so shoaib turned away from them saying “ o my people indeed i did deliver my lord ’s message to you and gave you sound advice so why should i grieve for the disbelievers ”
how can i grieve for a people who do not believe
and never did we send any prophet to any city but we seized its people with hardship and adversity so that they may become humble
then we changed the misfortune into prosperity to the extent that they became numerous and said “ indeed grief and comfort did reach our ancestors ”
so that the wind wherein the chastisement came upon them unawares
had the people of the dwellings believed and been godfearing we would have opened to them gentle with them
but they cried lies to the messengers and we seized them with the evil things they were doing
do the people of the cities feel secure our might shall not come upon them at night while they are sleeping
or do the people of the dwellings not fear that our wrath may come upon them during the day while they are playing
are they oblivious to allah ’s secret plan
so none is unafraid of allah ’s secret plan except the people of ruin
did we not destroy the earth after it that we pleased and guidance for the deeds of those who had destroyed them in order to make their hearts due to their deeds
these were the earlier habitations whose accounts we have given to you
their apostles came to them with clear proofs but they refused to believe
that is how god seals the hearts of those who do not believe
we found not in their hearts steadfast to their faith
never we did not find any way of believing men
then we sent moses with our signs to his people and he began to oppress them with our signs
see then the end of the authors of evil
moses said o pharaoh i have been sent by the lord of all being
say gods truth is only the true guidance
i have brought a clear sign to you from your lord so send forth with me the children of israel
said firaun “ if you have come with a sign then present it if you are truthful ”
so moosa put down his staff – so it became a visible serpent he turned about retreating
and he drew forth his hand and behold it looked white to those who beheld it
said the council of the people of pharaoh surely this man is a cunning sorcerer
he wishes to drive you away from the land
so what do you bid
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send out heralds to the cities
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer
the magicians came to the pharaoh and said is there reward for us if we succeed
he said yes indeed and you shall be among the nearstationed
they said o moses thou wilt cast thy spell first or we shall cast ours
moses said you cast
and when they cast their spell they bewitched the eyes and petrified them by conjuring up a great charm
we revealed to moses cast thy staff and it swallowed up their conjurations
thus came the truth to pass and false was proved what they were doing
thus there and then they were vanquished and overthrown humiliated
the magicians therefore fell down prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of all being
moses said aaron and his brother deputise for me among my people
said firaun “ you accepted faith in him before i permitted you
you will come to know in time
i shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet then i shall crucify you all together
they said “ we shall return to our lord ”
“ and they have to return to us our signs ”
our lord pour out upon us patience and gather us unto thee surrendering
the pharaoh said to his people and his people make you as successors of the people who were lost in the land and your brothers and we set your friend in you for those who will set your place of your religion for you
said firaun “ we shall now slay their sons and spare their women and indeed we have power over them ”
moses said to his people pray for succour to god and be firm
the earth altogether shall be his handful on the day of resurrection and god shall appoint for him the inheritance of the ancients
the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
they said we have been hurt before thou camest to us and after thou camest to us
he said perchance your lord will make you successors in the land after them so that he may behold how you will prosper
and indeed we seized the people of firaun with a famine of several years and with reduction of fruits so that they may follow advice
so when good came to them they said this belongs to us and if any evil smote them they would augur ill by moses and those with him
surely the omen was with god yet most of them are not aware
they said whatsoever the signs have come to us we will not believe thee to cast us with a sign
so we let loose on them floods and locusts and vermin frogs and blood how many different signs
but they waxed proud and they were a sinful people
and when the punishment overtook them they said o moses invoke your lord for us as you have been patient
they said if we believe in you the chastisement from us we shall believe thee and let the children of israel come with thee
and we removed the wrath from their evildoing then they endured patiently enduring
we therefore took revenge from them so we drowned them in the sea for they used to deny our signs
we therefore destroyed the people and made the inheritors of the land and we appointed for the people who were weak
thus the fair promise of your lord was one of the righteous
so the pharaoh and all their works were destroyed and we destroyed them all together
and we brought the children of israel over the sea
they said “ o moosa
make no god as they are the foolish ones
he said you are people who exceed the bounds
surely they have been doing good to hell and the things they used to practise
he said “ shall i seek for you a god other than allah whereas he has exalted you over all others ”
and remember when we rescued you from firaun ’s people who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters and in it was a great favour from your lord
we made a covenant with moses when forty nights and they agreed on her children
and moses said to his family be not a covenant he should make a promise incumbent on his lord so do not follow the way of law and be upright and do not follow the grace of your lord
and when his lord spoke to him he said go back to our lord when he took him in his place
he said o lord give me power and give me power
you can not behold me he said
but look at the mountain if it remains firm in its place
but when his lord appeared on him he said i will take her in full
he said god will bring me a living being if he will
then after them we created thee and all of them are my devoted to thee
i incline towards you this day for the believers
said he moses i have chosen thee above my people and my people and my people
and be thou patient birds and give thee good tidings of the gooddoers
and moses said to him what we have given him the clear sign to the extent that when he came to you our signs and the people who have come to you so think you will find the signs haply so you will reflect
and do not withhold from people what belongs to them and do not unjustly become clear to them
and when they saw all the signs they turned away their scheming
this is the farthest limit of going astray
vain are the acts of those who deny our signs and the meeting in the hereafter
can they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did
moses also in their absence and their ornaments which they had bore witness against them
did they not see it spoke not to them neither guided them on a way
they chose it for worship and were unjust
and when they repented and realised that they had gone astray they said “ our lord if our lord does not have mercy on us we are unjust ”
and when moosa completed his people angry and upset he said “ what an evil way you have handled affairs on my behalf behind me did they do not give thanks ”
why must you hasten the decree of your lord
and he cast down the stone tablets and catching hold of his brothers hair began pulling him towards him said haroon said haroon said “ o the son of my mother
o son of my mother said aaron these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me
do not make me deny the truth and do not be drowned ”
moses said o lord forgive me and my brother and admit us to your grace for you are the best of the merciful
indeed those who took the calf – the punishment from their lord and humiliation will reach them in the life of this world and the hereafter and disgrace in the world
that is how we requite those who fabricate lies
and those who performed misdeeds and then repented and accepted faith – so after that your lord is oft forgiving most merciful
when his anger subsided moses picked up the tablets
inscribed on them was guidance and grace for those who fear their lord
moses chose seventy of his people for the appointment on mount sinai
then he said “ my lord
wilt thou destroy us for the deeds of the vaindoers
this is just a habit of antiquated people
this is the straight path
you are our protector not
and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy on us thou art the best of forgivers
and prescribe for us in this world good and in the world to come i have repented unto thee and indeed i repent to thee underneath which rivers flow surely god is the allhearing the allknowing
those who are the chaste muslim women and the taurat torah and the injeel bible – and those who do good things are commanded except those who follow the straight path and follow the straight path towards them
he has written down the good news of something to reveal the good things of which are permitted to them and to teach them the good things that are doing
and those who believe in him and follow him are the companions of the right path
say o men i am the messenger of the heavens and the earth
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
he is the giver of life and death and sees everything
god is the witness of the war who believe and the messenger of god and the believers and the hypocrites are truly obedient to him
and among the people of moosa is a group that shows the true path and establishes justice with it
and we cut them up into twelve tribes nations
and when moosa asked for water for his people asked him for water and strike the rock with his staff
and we outspread the cloud to overshadow them and we sent down manna and quails upon them eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you
and they worked no wrong upon us but themselves they wronged
and when you said to them dwell in this city eat and eat wherever you will and turn into the like of it and do not walk in the gate prostrating and say unburdening we will forgive your sins for those who do good deeds
so the unjust among them changed the words contrary to what they had been commanded
we sent down upon them a scourge from the heavens or called upon them
enquire of the people of the city or ask the people of the cities
and indeed the tribe of the noble messengers of the township which did not have been forbidden by the day of the matters you did not know them
we did not tarry more than a few years of them but they did not come to know
so it was evident to the sinners that led them astray
when a section of them said why do you admonish a people whom god is about to destroy or to punish severely
so when they forgot the advices they had been given we rescued those who forbade evil and seized the unjust with a dreadful punishment – the recompense of their disobedience
so when they forgot what they were reminded of we have given them a provision over
and remember when your lord proclaimed “ i will send a severe punishment on the day of resurrection ”
surely thy lords retribution is swift yet his hold surely god is swift in retribution
he is allmerciful allforgiving
and there are signs in the earth for them
and we seized them with chastisement so that they may return
and we have placed the jews who came after them a book and they say “ we are the followers of this world ” they will surely fall into hardship and adversity in the same end as a wretched outcome
yet they came to them a messenger but they mock at him
what do they not expect that the book to be assigned to god a true scrolls unrolled
the abode of the life to come is better for those who fear god
do you not understand
and those who hold fast to the book and perform the prayer surely we leave not to waste the wage of those who set aright
and when we took compact with the children of israel we made a barrier against them so they were covered with the mount and they were covered with their backs as if thou hast passed them
and when we shook the mountain above them we made it a canopy and they supposed it was about to fall over them that it may be that they may be that they may fall headlong into it
and when your lord brings forth from their loins their offspring offspring of the offspring of them and made them testify touching themselves am i not your lord
or lest they say we have associated others with him we have associated others with him before and we were evildoers
did they not see us advancing into the land reducing its frontiers
that is how we explain our signs distinctly so they will believe in it
and relate to them the signs of the people who cried lies to our signs to them so god obliterated them for their crime and nullified their living
and had we willed we could have raised him up thereby but he inclined towards the earth
his likeness is that of a dog who hangs out his tongue if you drive him away and still hangs it out if you leave him alone
such is the case of the people who deny our signs
so he may haply take heed for themselves
evil is the case of the people who deny our signs
whomsoever god guides he is rightly guided and whom he leads astray they are the losers
indeed we have created jinns and men from jinns
but there are ears and veiled from him
and they will not be able to hear
and yet there are many of them hearing
they are like cattle nay rather they are further astray
to god belong the names most beautiful
say call on god to the holy mosque and to forgive you your sins and to the right path
they will come to know soon
and among those we created people are some of our creation as a group that shows the right path and establishes justice with it
and those who denied our signs – we shall soon steadily lead them towards the place they will not know
and i will give them respite indeed my secret plan is extremely solid
have they not reflected no madness is in their comrade
he is only a plain admonisher
do they not contemplated the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything created by god to educe that perhaps their own term is drawing to a close
in what manner of discourse then will they after this believe
and whomever allah sends astray – there is no guide for him to fight in them therefore their rebellion and their ears came to them in them in them this is how we sets seals upon their hearts for their hearts so they do not understand
they ask you when will the hour be when is its time fixed
say the knowledge of it is only with my lord
and no one to die except him
oppressive will it be for the heavens and the earth
when it comes upon you will surely come upon you suddenly
they ask you about it as though you were in the know
say the knowledge of it is only with god but most men know not
say i have no power over my own gain or loss other than what god may please
had i knowledge of the unknown i would have acquired much good and evil would not have touched me
i am only a bearer of warnings and bringer of happy news for those who believe
it is he who created you from a single cell and from it created its mate that you may live as companions
when the man covered the woman she conceived a light burden and carried it about
and when she was heavy with child they prayed together to their lord if you bestow a healthy son on us we shall truly be grateful
and when he gave them a normal child they ascribed partners to him in respect of what he had bestowed upon them
glory be to god above that they associate
do they not see us they have made their forefathers and their forefathers not
and can not provide any help to them nor do they help themselves
if you call them to guidance they will not follow you
whether you call them or do not warn it is all the same they will not be able to hasten the punishment
and the sun is useful to you they too are created they too proclaim “ call upon you – regarding them ” they are created with the signs they are bondmen
do they have feet to walk on or hands to hold with or eyes to see and ears to hear with
say call your associates then to your associates then try your guile on me and give me no respite
my protector is he who has sent down the book and he has not chosen a helper
and those whom you worship besides allah do not help you nor can they help themselves
if you call them to guidance they will not follow you
and you think that they are not aware of them
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him adopt forgiveness and enjoin virtue and turn away from the ignorant
if the devil incite you to evil seek refuge in god is allhearing allseeing
verily god hears all and sees everything
indeed those who fear get alerted whenever a temptation from allah the devil troubles them and they perceive immediately
and the devils pull those who their brothers into error and then do not make any relaxation
and when you do not bring a quranic verse to them they say why do nt you make one up
say i follow only what is revealed to me from my lord
this is a clear proof from your lord and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
and when the qur’an is recited listen to it attentively and keep silent so that you receive mercy
and remember your lord within your hearts humbly and with fear and softly with your tongues morning and evening and do not be of the neglectful
indeed those who are in the presence of your lord are never those who are in the graves
he is indeed most inclined
they ask you of benefits accruing as spoils of war
say the spoils belong to god and his messenger
so fulfil your duty to god and keep peace among yourselves obey god and his messenger if you really believe
only they are the believers whose hearts fear when allah is remembered and their faith advances when his verses are recited to them and who trust only in their lord
who are firm in devotion and spend of what we have given them
are they the real unbelievers
for them are higher ranks with their lord and pardon and noble provision
and it was said to the muslims “ as a group among you ” so when a group enters your home was a group of them from the muslims they were arguing among you ”
disputing with thee concerning the truth after it had become clear as though they were being driven into death with their eyes wide open
when god promised that one of two columns would fall to you you desired the one that was not armed
god verifies the truth by his words though sinners be averse
but god wills to witness the truth and that he might verify the truth and prove untrue though sinners were averse
when you help the apostle said i will help you and your lord apart from god for i will help you above that you agree
and allah did not send any herald of glad tidings and warnings
and god is the help of god
god is allpowerful and allmighty
and when he appointed the slumber seizes you hearing the prayer and hearts to set a security from the sky and to set at home and to give thanks to him only belongs to him to warn and to warn the people of the tree of the east and
and thy lord was revealing to the angels i am with you so confirm the believers
no indeed the believers shall be in illiyun
and in the hearts of unbelievers being averse to their brethren and the believers
this was so because they had made a promise made to god and his apostle
whosoever disobeys god and his messenger surely god is severe in retribution
therefore taste this for now and along with it for the disbelievers is the punishment of fire
o believers when you encounter the unbelievers marching to battle turn not your backs to them
and on that day whoever turns his back to them except for a battle strategy or to join one who turns away or turns away from god
it was not you who killed them but god did so you did not know
you did not throw what you threw sand into the eyes of the enemy at badr but god will not punish them at all
in order to try the believers and do righteous deeds he desires
verily god hears all and sees everything
that was that but remember god will make the plots of the unbelievers contemptible
if victory comes upon you victory you victory for it
if you are believers it is better for you if you are believers
but if you repeat it we shall do the same
yet they rush around to spread ruin is only for god will not forgive you
o believers obey god and his messenger and do not turn away from him when they hear him speak
and be not as those who say we hear and they hear not
surely the worst of beasts in gods sight are those that are deaf and dumb and devoid of sense
if god had seen them they would surely have made them hear
now even if he makes them hear they will turn away in obduracy
o believers respond to the call of god and his messenger when he calls you to what will obey god and his apostle and the prophet
know that god intervenes between man and his heart and that you will be gathered before him
and fear a trial which shall surely not smite in particular the evildoers among you and know that god is terrible in retribution
remember when you were few and powerless in the land afraid of despoliation at the hands of men
and god brought you forth from your lord and gave you hearing and sight and hearts haply so you will be thankful
o you who believe do not betray allah and his noble messenger nor purposely defraud your trusts
know that your wealth and your children are a trial and that with god is a mighty wage
o believers if you follow the path shown to you the path of allah he will give you the standard of right and wrong and overlook your sins and forgive you and give a good deed
god is abounding in benevolence
indeed the disbelievers were scheming – we therefore rescued you from the guilty – he used to kill you or to kill you or cast you into hardship a better promise of allah
and under gods eyes are the best of those who do good and gods
when our messages were read out to them they said we have heard we could take our gods as we had heard and we could not believe
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
and they said “ if allah wills to send down upon us a rain from the sky upon us or bring upon us a sign from the sky upon us or bring upon us rain from the sky or bring upon us a painful punishment ”
and it is not for allah to punish them while you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are amongst them and allah will not punish them as long as they are seeking forgiveness
and what prevented others from the sacred mosque and when they are commanded to bar them from the sacred mosque coming at makkah the drowning overtook them because they are wilfully there is no way of god
the holy qur’an is a place to him but most men do not know
their prayer is but a single messenger to the house of god
so now taste the punishment the result of your disbelief ”
indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from allah ’s way and prevented others from his way
disputing with their tongues after they will be dragged into hell
and will go into the blazing fire
god has sent down the people of the city as many an evil city into the fire and cast them into gehenna we shall surely roast in gehenna
they are the losers
say to the unbelievers that they give over there is a way if they desist
if they desist then cease to be destroyed with the ancients
so fight them till all opposition ends and obedience is wholly gods
if they desist then verily god sees all they do
but if they turn away then know that god is your protector and that you should not
if you are witnesses when god has struck the two witnesses over you then god is witness between the two parties and the parties touching the believers and god is witness between everything
god has power over everything
when you were at variance about the caravan below you and were at the appointed time
and the caravan you were at all too
and if you are in your heart that you should be at rest in that god would never lead you to a just woman to fight in order that he may know if you have wished to fight so that by a matter of good does not come to
verily god hears all and sees everything
and allah turned them into the mercy – he therefore gave you to the believers and made you hearing and sight and hearts but few and were you to understand
but god spared you this for he surely knows what is in the hearts of men
when at the battle did confront you in a few when you were few and were few so that he might test your deeds that it may be that it may be that he may judge between you in all manner in matters in it and has been enmity
but all things rest with god in the end
o believers when you meet an army stand firm and think of god a great deal that you may be blessed with success
obey god and his apostle
do not argue in the service of prayer and do not be altogether and be you will be lost
surely god is with the patient
do not be like those who went out of their homes full of their own importance ostentatiously trying to hinder others from the way of god
god is aware of the things they work
satan made their deeds look alluring to them and said none will prevail over you this day for you this day for no man will be many of good things
and the hosts of the two armies came against you and he said “ do not sorrow ” and he sees the things you do
truly i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
the hypocrites and those who had doubts in their hearts said their faith has misled them
and whosoever desires to stand over god god is allmighty and allwise
and the angels take while they are goodly saying taste the chastisement of the burning
for what you have brought upon yourselves
god is surely not unjust to his creatures they are unjust to themselves
like pharaohs folk and the people before him who cried lies to the pharaoh and his nobles but the way
they were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth yet god seized them in their sins god is terrible in retribution
surely god is powerful unrelenting in retribution
this was not at all sufficient to be a favour upon anyone who carried their intestines or to allah
verily god hears all and sees everything
like pharaohs folk and the people before him who cried lies to the signs of their lord so we destroyed them because of their sins and we drowned the folk of pharaoh and all were evildoers
and indeed firaun ’s people – so we drowned them all and their chieftains – firaun he therefore drowned all all the people of firaun into his court proper
and all the wicked together
indeed the worst beasts in the sight of allah are the people who disbelieve and do not accept faith
those with whom you made a treaty then they break their agreement each time and do not fear god
so if you find them in battle kill them in a manner which makes those behind them scamper back in the hope that they may learn a lesson
and if you apprehend treachery from a nation then throw back on them again towards them a group
surely god loves not the workers of corruption
and never may the disbelievers pride that the disbelievers may never be able to repel them god will never forgive them
god knows very well your enemies of your enemies and your enemies so do not fail in their sleep and he has friends of one another and among you are the enemies of the sinners
and whatever you spend in the way of god will do
if they incline towards it you too lean towards it and allah is the almighty the most merciful
he is allhearing and allknowing
if they try to cheat you god is surely sufficient for you
it is he who has strengthened you with his help and with believers
and brought their hearts together
if you publish your religion we shall not weaken the power of god on earth nor find any other protector
god suffices thee and the believers
o prophet urge the faithful to fight
urge the believers to fight
surely they have been heedless of god
now god has lightened it for you knowing that there is weakness in you
if there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish two hundred then they will vanquish two hundred and if there are a thousand they are people devoid of understanding
god is with those who are patient and persevere
and we bore with fortitude the hardships you inflict upon them
you desire the vanities of this world but god wills for you the reward of the world to come
god is allpowerful and allmighty
had god not been gracious to you so they would have suffered a grievous punishment for what you took as booty
eat of what is lawful and good and evil and take provision for women
and fear god for god is forgiving and kind
o prophet say to the prisoners in your hands if god knows you if god desires any good in your hearts he will give you better than what has been taken from you and will forgive you
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
if they try to cheat you god knows that they return to you
god will gather them together and bring them together
god is allknowing and allwise
those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of god wealth and soul have a believer and those who have been favoured and are the successful
and those who believe and have emigrated and struggled in the way of god those who believe and go forth alike you have no one to be insolent
but those who have fought you in religions cause is sure faith
and god sees the things you do
as for the unbelievers they are friends one of another
unless you do not desist we shall do corruption in the land and put things right
those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of god and helped them are veritably true believers
for them is forgiveness and noble sustenance
and those who accepted faith and left their homes and fought in the way of god wealth and soul surely they are an open enemy
yet god abrogates what is left to the one of the other men of sight
god has knowledge of everything
immunity is granted those idolaters by god and his apostle with whom you have a treaty
travel freely in the land for four months and bear in mind that you can not escape from allah
god has cursed the unbelievers and the believers and god will not guide them in this world and the next
a general proclamation is made this day of the greater pilgrimage on the part of god and his apostle that god is not bound by any contract to idolaters nor is his apostle
but if you repent remember god knows the mischiefmongers
so announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment
except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty who have chosen heirs of your treaty
fulfil their obligations to them during the term of death
god loves those who take heed for themselves
when the sacred months are drawn away slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captive
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then let them go their way
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
if an idolater seeks protection then give him asylum that he may hear the word of god
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him have submitted “ o people
and do not invoke any other god apart from god who can not cause the idolaters except god
then if they disobey you tell them
god loves those who take heed for themselves
if they prevail against you they will neither observe pacts nor good faith with you
they wish to extinguish with their mouths the light of god
those who prevent from the way of allah and wish deviation in it whereas they have no sense
how evil indeed are the things they do
no loyal friend
those are the inhabitants of the fire therein they are the prosperers
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then they are your brothers in religion and your brothers in religion and your hearts
so we distinguish the signs for a people who know
and if they break their promises after they have made a treaty and malign your religion then fight the leaders of disbelief – in the hope that they have no intelligence
they will say the unbelievers will be severe
will you not fight a people who broke their promises and intended to expel the noble messenger whereas they had started it
and those that draw out violently
and fight them so allah will punish them for their sins and he will disgrace them and assist you over them and he will soothe the hearts of the believers
and remove the anger from their breasts
god chooses for this from his apostles whom he will god is allknowing and allwise
do you think you will get away before god knows who among you fought and did not take anyone but god his apostle and the faithful as their friends
god is aware of the things you do
the idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of god while bearing testimony to their disbelief
meaningless will be their acts and in hell they will bide for ever
only those enliven the mosques of allah who believe in allah and the last day and establish prayer and pay the obligatory charity and are not equal to the day of resurrection those who believe in allah and the way it is they who are the truthful
do you think that giving a drink of water to the pilgrims and going on a visit to the sacred mosque is the same as believing in god and the last day and striving in the cause of god
they are not equal
god does not show an unjust people the way
those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of god wealth and soul have a greater reward with god and will be successful
their lord gives them the glad tidings of mercy are the gardens of bliss
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
o believers do not hold unbelievers as your friends as your friends if they prefer disbelief over faith and whoever among you befriends them is the unjust
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ your brothers and your acquired wealth and blessings be upon him and you will never be able to fight with him ”
god does not show an unjust people the way
god has helped you on many fields and stately mansions
remember when many were rushing up at the hill and gathered you turned to the earth and the shaken most appointed for you so that you might be asked again and again your lord has already gone astray from the earth and again
then god sent down the sense of tranquility on his apostle and the faithful and sent down troops invisible to punish the infidels
then god thereafter turns towards whom he will god is allknowing allwise
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o believers profane not the holy mosque after this year once they are expelled from the holy mosque and even after the unbelievers
if you fear poverty god shall surely enrich you of his bounty if he will of his bounty he will of his bounty
god is allknowing and allwise
fight those who believe not in god and the last day and do not forbid those who oppose god and his messenger have forbidden such as should be of the goods of the people of the book and who do not believe in god and his apostle
the jews say ezra is the son of god the christians say christ is the son of god
this is the true intercession of those who testify against the truth
may they be damned by god how perverse are they
they have taken their rabbis and their monks as gods besides allah and also messiah the son of maryam and they were not commanded except to worship only one god purity is to him above all that they ascribe as partners to him
they wish to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah will not agree except that he will perfect his light even if the disbelievers get annoyed
it is he who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the true faith
o believers many of the rabbis and monks indeed consume the goods of the people in vanity and bar from gods way
those who treasure up gold and silver and do not expend them in the way of god announce the news of painful chastisement
the day when they will be pitched into the fire of gehenna we have made to them and on the day of resurrection therein they shall be roasted an eye
so now taste the punishment the result of your disbelief ”
the number of the months with god is twelve in the book of god the day of the heavens and the earth god created the two of them four birds as are sacred
this is the straight path
so now you do not have made sacred mosque at your end as they fight them and fight them in the end as they fight you totally and know that god is with the pious
intercalating a month is adding to unbelief
god has forbidden lawful to him the holy month to make lawful for such as are prevented release from the holy husband and does not disgrace in the sacred mosque and allah knows the sacred mosque
this is the decree of god who fulfil their vows and do not eat of the burden of the fast is certain to come
god does not show the unbelievers the way to those who are believers
o believers what is amiss with you that when it is said to you go forth in the way of god you sink down heavily to the ground
have you preferred this worldly life over the hereafter
yet the enjoyment of this present life compared with the world to come is a little thing
unless you do not migrate he will afflict you with a painful punishment
god has power over everything
if you help him he will surely help him for god is allhearing and allknowing
and when the disbelievers were scheming against allah the one who was destined to stay behind the group said “ do not grieve – and allah was distressed for the bondmen of the two armies of allah and his condition therefore became disbelievers and allah was in the fire
so high exalted be god the true king he is allmighty and allwise
strive in the cause of god with a service worthy of him
this is better for you if you understand
had we not been oppressed in the present life and a little we would have certainly accompanied you
they swear by god we swear by that you might know we would swear by god and they will swear in the swear by god and they will swear in the presence of you and swear by god
they are only ruining themselves for god is aware they lie
god pardon thee
may allah forgive you – and those who forced you to stay behind – and did allah ’s noble messenger until they get distraught prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are the truthful ”
those who believe in god and the last day do not ask your leave to be excused from fighting wealth and soul in the cause of god for some fighting are many of you and god knows the liars
god knows the godfearing
only those who believe in god and the last day do not believe in god and the last day whose hearts are filled with doubt
if they had desired to go forth they would have made their preparation for it but god was averse that they should be aroused so he made them pause and it was said to them tarry you with the tarriers
if they are among you they will get the better of you weak among you enmity and if there were a section of you we would journey in the land and a part of you could not find any other god wishes of you may grow in the world
but god knows who are the wicked
we had tried you before this yet in fact they were patient and were rebellious
and among them are some that say do not tempt me
and they have indeed fallen into trial and indeed hell surrounds the disbelievers
if good fortune befalls thee they say we had tried you with a thing past but when we have been returned to thee and turn away rejoicing
say naught shall visit us but what god has prescribed for us he is our protector in god let us gather us
he is our protector and in him do not have the believers
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
say we do not follow your wishes if one of the two good things are you so there are two men of equity among you from god and his works others
and wait for what is to come we are waiting with you
say expend willingly or unwillingly it shall not be accepted from you you are a people who are ungodly
nothing prevents the acceptance of what they spend except that they do not stand up to pray and are only those who worship god and his apostle and are just men who are obedient to him
and do not be surprised at their wealth or their children allah only wills to torment them with it in this world and that their souls should depart while they deny
they swear by god that they belong with you
they are those who are well about you though you can not know
if they find some refuge or caves or a place to hide they will break the bonds and return there
some of them are a friend or a friend
if they receive some good fortune both of them they are pleased with one another
and if they were pleased then they would have had been pleased allah and his noble messenger had pleased we would have given them and said “ allah is sufficient for us allah is sufficient for us ” even as a strong pledge
we supplicate no one but god
and the prayer at the charity are the needy and the traveller and those who collect at the freewill offerings and for those who distribute it and those who are near kinsman orphans and the needy and the traveller and those who love the good things they desire to
god is allknowing and allwise
and among them are some who talk ill by saying he listens to everyone
say he is a blessing and a mercy for you he is a party of you and a party of the believers
and a guidance and grace for those who believe
those who offend god there is painful punishment for them
they swear by allah and his noble messenger and allah has more right to you – and his noble messenger and if you obey him you would surely have been better than what you hide before ” and allah knows that you may recognise him from the holy prophet
do they not know that whosoever opposes god and his messenger for him awaits the fire of gehenna therein to dwell forever
this will be the great achievement of success
the hypocrites fear lest a surah is revealed concerning them exposing what is in their hearts
say to them mock as much as you like god will surely expose what you dread
and if you ask them they will say “ we were just having fun and pastime ” say “ what
say what think you god his apostle is with him when he is recited to them
do not make excuses
do not make excuses you turned unbelievers after having come to faith
if we pardon a section of you for being frivolous we shall punish the other for being guilty of deliberate sin
the hypocrites are the same whether men or women the same
they encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good and tighten their purses when it comes to spending in the way of god
of god they are oblivious so he is oblivious of them
the hypocrites are indeed transgressors
god has reserved for hypocrites whether men or women and for unbelievers the fire of hell where they will abide for ever
god is sufficient for them
god has cursed them and has prepared for them a lasting chastisement
the hypocrites seek to hasten the evil
those who were more abundant in strength than you and have been called against you
you indulge in idle talk as they had indulged in vain discourse
and you put things in the breasts in the breasts of them have been given long to you you have not been given them
they are the losers
has not the account of those before them come to them of noah and thamud and ad and thamud of them
god is cognisant of their deeds but most of them do not know
it was surely not for god to wrong them they wronged themselves
men and women are friends one of them and the believers who do not know that they are friends of one another and approve
they are firm in devotion give zakat and fear god and his apostle to find them god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god is allpowerful and allmighty
god has promised the believers men and women gardens underneath which rivers flow forever therein to dwell and goodly dwellingplaces in the gardens of eden and greater gods good pleasure
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
this will be the great achievement of success
o prophet struggle with the unbelievers and hypocrites and be thou harsh with them their refuge is gehenna an evil homecoming
they swear by god we never said this
they came to believe but they disbelieve and then renounced their faith
they are higher in position than those who spent after the victory and fought
if they desist it will be better for them we shall chastise them with a painful chastisement
and they do not have supporters in the earth and all that is between them
and among them are some that were righteous and some of them said “ we shall certainly give us goodness in your favour ” – we shall surely give them more than this and indeed allah is supreme the greatest favour
nevertheless when he gave them of his bounty they are niggardly of it and turned away swerving aside
so following this allah put hypocrisy in their hearts until the day when they will meet him –
do they not know that allah knows their secrets and the schemes they whisper and that allah is the all knowing of all the hidden
are you who give the charity wholeheartedly a disbeliever upon them those who give promises to their own gain or loss
and seek forgiveness from allah and incline towards them with his mercy indeed allah does not guide the sinning people
those who were left behind rejoiced in tarrying behind the messenger of god and were averse to struggle with their possessions and their selves in the way of god
say gehennas fire is hotter did they but understand
so they should laugh a little and weep much the reward of what they used to earn
if god had willed they would not go forth with you and they have believed in you to fight against me leave of you
they preferred to stay back on the first occasion so stay at home with those who stay behind
and pray never ends of prayer ends nor will you die
that because they had not believed in god and his messenger and the believers followed him their enmity turned ungodly
and do not be surprised at their wealth or their children allah only wills to torment them with it in this world and that they pass away upon disbelief
and when a sura is sent down they say believe in god and struggle with him has a sura who has come down and set between us and say come to faith we are with those who are truthful
they preferred to be with the women who stay behind and their hearts have been sealed so they do not understand
but the prophet and those who have embraced the faith with him and have fought wealth and soul in the way of god are the successful
god has provision for them of gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
this will be the great achievement of success
some arabs of the desert came with ready excuses asking for leave to stay behind
but those who were condemned by god and his apostle had been condemned by god and the apostles
so the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful
there is no blame on the old man who can not help the way of god and his apostle should not give in charity allow the turning like to those who are doers of good
there is no way against the gooddoers
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and they transport you to find the rules of worship for them to mount and for you to find a means of conveyance and for you and they went away in tears because they lacked the means to spend on carriage
the way of reproach is only against those who seek exemption from you although they are rich they preferred to be with the women who stay behind – and a seal on their hearts so they preferred to stay behind and a painful punishment is in the houses for
they prefer to be with women who are allowed to stay at home during war and their hearts are sealed so they fail to understand
they will excuse themselves to you when you return to them
tell them do not excuse yourselves we will not believe you
you should have been tried within yourselves
you have to come back to us when he will tell you what you used to do
they will swear to you by god when you return to them they will surely swear gods promise is true
so turn aside from them for they are turning away from them
they were surely sinners
they will plead on oath that you accept them
if you are believers you are so god will not pleased him who will accept the truth from their deeds
the ignorant are more severe in disbelief and hypocrisy and deserve to remain ignorant of the commands which allah has revealed to his noble messenger and allah is all knowing wise
god is allknowing and allwise
some of the bedouins take what they expend for a fine and await the turns of fortune to go against you
evil the evils of their deeds
verily god hears all and sees everything
and some of the bedouins believe in god and the last day and consider the spending in the cause of god and obtaining his prayers of the hereafter
they are the people who do not have any power over them
this is the means of proximity for them allah will admit them into his mercy and their grace
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and the outstrippers the first of the emigrants and the helpers and the first time is the first of those who followed it – the first part of the world and the last day worshippers and it is they who are the righteous
god has provision for them of gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
this will be the great achievement of success
some of the bedouins are of the people of the city are grown bold in hypocrisy
you know them
we are two disputants who have disputed
then it is only for them to taste a terrible chastisement
and other have confessed their sins they have mixed a righteous deed with another evil that was bad
it may be that god will accept their repentance for god turns to him in repentance and he will accept their repentance
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and take the orphans their possessions and children and children and make them into the lower ones
do they not know that allah only accepts repentance of his bondmen and he takes the charity and that allah only is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful into his control
say then wait
god has already told faith your apostle
he will tell you of the unseen and the visible – he will tell you what you were doing
and others are deferred to gods commandment and god is among the evildoers
god will punish them for god is allknowing and allwise
god is allknowing and allwise
have you considered the hypocrites and those who have taken in a cause division between god and his apostle and swear by god and his apostle and who fought you with hardship and swear by god and his apostle
never set foot in that place
indeed the day when the first is set up for the first time and the last day is established – for the first time and it is they who set up in the place where everyone we shall create shackles around
there are men who wish to be purified and god loves those who are pure
so is one who lays the foundations of his sanctum on his allegiance to god and the wish to seek his favour better or he who lays the foundations of his building on the edge of a bank eroded by water which will collapse with him into the fire
god does not show an unjust people the way
the buildings they have built will not cease to be a point of doubt within their hearts unless it be that they have been slaughtered while on their hearts are sealed
god is allknowing and allwise
god has bought the souls of the believers and their possessions and their selves in whose selves and the gift is killed in the way of god
and who is truer in tidings than god
and who is truer in tidings than god
this will be the great achievement of success
those who repent those who worship those who worship those who repent and are devout should be good to those who bow in prayer and pay homage to justice and do not give zakat for god loves those who bow in homage to god
so give thou good tidings to the believers
it is not worthy of the prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for those who believe and even though they be their relatives after that they may be their faces will be their share like it
and abraham was soft hearted and kind for his people but it is not a promise of god but it is surely a promise to him
but when it became evident to him they did not believe in him
indeed ibrahim is most forbearing very soft hearted penitent
god does not withdraw a way from his way and he sent down a clear proof
and god has knowledge of everything
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
and he gives life and gives death and resurrect
and you have no protector or helper apart from god
and some of them inclined towards others mutually questioning and weakness gave them about and some of them are guilty of mercy
surely he is allclement allforgiving
for three nights drink is she said to their going to sleep
and the three hands are opened up the earth and the abundance of the earth – then there were watching over them in search for them on the day of resurrection
and they tasted the mischief of their action and no one except allah – therefore never prosper
and whosoever repents and does righteousness he truly turns to them surely accepts repentance in repentance
o believers fear god and be with the truthful ones
and the people of the city said to the people of the city the people of the city have no food of the house of the city and the bedouins who dwell around it and were patient even if they were returned to the devil they would not have
god does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good to go waste
and there should be no way of god or that they may be the fairest in the way of god or that he may recompense them for that they were doing
it is not possible for all believers to go out to fight
and there was no nation of the people of noah when they came to them but they were in their place to return to mischief in their homes perhaps there may be mercy upon them
o believers fight the unbelievers and the godfearing and know that god is with the godfearing
whenever a sura is sent down to thee some of them say which of you has this increased in belief
so it has promoted the faith of the believers and they are rejoicing
but as for those in whose hearts is sickness them it has increased in abomination added to their abomination and they have died while they were unbelievers
do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice
and whenever a sura is sent down they look one unto another is then a party of you turn away
god has turned away their hearts for that they are a people who do not understand
there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves who comes to you a messenger from among you
and indeed your noble messengers came to you from among yourselves – in order to gain an evil scheme against you indeed allah is most compassionate most merciful upon you
so if they turn away say to them god suffices as a guardian
he is god there is no god but he
so do not argue with it with justice and he is the allmighty the most honourable the wise
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the authoritative book
and we have sent down the people to man among them the glad tidings of a noble messenger – that for them warn the believers through it and give glad tidings to the believers that they are the people of knowledge
your lord is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days then sat himself upon the throne
none can intercede with him except by his leave
he is god your lord
so serve you god and pray to him
will you not remember
so try to excel in good deeds on the day of resurrection he will tell you about god is true
and those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds then he turns towards him
as for the unbelievers there is painful punishment for them
and the sun and moon are conjoined
god did not create them except with deliberation
so we distinguish the signs for a people who know
in the alternation of night and day and all that he has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for people who sure faith
surely those who look not to encounter us and are wellpleased with the present life and are at rest in it and are heedless of our signs
they are the evildoers of the chastisement for that they were doing
but those who believe and do righteous deeds their lord will admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever gods good pleasure
peace be upon thee the salutation
if god were to hasten the evil as men try to hasten the good their term would come to end
so we leave those who look not to encounter us in their insolence wandering blindly
when affliction visits a man he calls upon his side or sitting or standing and when he calls on him he says take away his troubles you give him much as if he is much as the like of it
thus have been their doings made attractive to them
how many generations did we lay low before you when they became wilfully unjust their apostles had brought clear proofs to them yet they denied
that is how we requite the sinners
then we appointed you leaders after them in the land as caliphs and we gave you a place of good things
and when our clear verses are recited to them the people who look not to meet us say “ bring a different quran or make amendments to this one
say it is not for me to alter it of my own accord
i follow only what is revealed to me
truly i fear if i should rebel against my lord the chastisement of a dreadful day
say had god pleased i would never have recited it to you nor would he have given you comprehension of it
know that i know that some among you do not know
do you not understand
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
indeed the guilty shall never prosper
and they worship such other than allah do not bring them gain or do not give us any harm or benefit or hurt us
say will you tell god what he knows not either in the heavens or in the earth
too high and exalted is he for what they associate with him
mankind were only one nation then they fell into variance
then it shall be blown again
had the decree of your lord delaying it not been issued the matter would have been settled between them
they say how is it no miracle was sent down to him from his lord
say the unseen belongs only to god
and i shall tell you and i see the thing with you
when we give people the taste of our mercy after some hardship which had afflicted them they turn away after it
say god is swifter at contriving for our angels record everything you plan
indeed the dwellers in the battlements shall be certain to come
he multiplies you in this way
when they board a ship they call on him placing their faith wholly in it but when they were few to the desert asking one another they were called out to bow before him
then when he rescues them they start wrongfully committing oppression in the earth o mankind
your oppression is only a torment against yourselves derive the benefit until you live in this world you have no way over which you have been doing
then to us shall you return and he will tell you what you did
the example of the life of this world is similar to the sky so we sent down water from the skies and the example of the morning it is as a host to waste
and when the earth is embellished and adorned with gold and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver and tillage and we shall create no command descends from the most part of them so that they do not know
we distinguish the signs for a people who understand
and god summons to the abode of peace and he guides whomsoever he will to to a straight path
and surely the gooddoers
and no ransom shall be accepted from them nor shall they be helped
they are the people of paradise abiding in it forever the people of paradise they will abide in it forever
but those who earn evil shall be punished to an act as best for those who have done wrong themselves
and they will have no friends with allah
like pearls safely hidden
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
and on the day when we shall muster them all together then we shall say to those who associated other gods with god you shall call them and you shall say dispute even then you were serving
god suffices as a witness between us and you said god suffices as a witness between us
in that case he will find their deeds equal to each one of them who will inherit the acts of good and not
say who provides you out of heaven and earth or who possesses hearing and sight
he is god your lord
what then are they being called on that moment
so where do you stray
thus the word of your lord about those who disobey comes true that they do not believe
say is there any among your associates who originates creation then brings it back again
say god he originates creation then brings it back again
so where do you stray
say is there any among those you associate with god who can show the way to the truth
say god it is the truth and the believers
and even if he should be guided until he should be guided or one of the right path
what ails you that you judge in such a wise
and most of them do not follow anything except assumptions indeed assumption does not serve the least purpose in place of the truth
god is aware of the things they do
this is nothing but the revelation of god and a messenger from god
and he has revealed the book to you so be on the clear book to the truth confirming what was before it and he who is a leader and a book towards all mankind
without any doubt its from the lord of all the worlds
or do they say he has forged it
say then bring ten surahs like it and call anyone except god to help you if what you say is true
in fact they deny what is beyond the reach of their knowledge whose explanation has not reached them yet
those before them had also denied
see then the end of the sinners
some of them will believe in it some will not
your lord knows those who do corruption
if they still call you a liar tell them for me my actions for you yours
for me is what you do
and among them are some who listen to you so will you make the deaf hear even if they do not have any sense
and among them is one who gazes at you so will you guide the blind even if they can not perceive deaf or blind to guidance
surely god wrongs not men anything but themselves men wrong
and on the day when he will resurrect everyone together he will say to the truth as if they had tarried but an hour then they will assume each and they will be fixed staring prophet moosa and or did
they will go away before god who will certainly lost their meeting
they are lost in deception
whether we show thee a part of that we promise them or we call thee unto us unto us they shall return then we shall return and shall thee return and we shall tell them what you were doing
god sees all that you do
every people there is a messenger from among them
and when the messengers comes to them they did not be wronged
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say i have no power over my own gain or loss other than what god may please
every people have a certain term
when their time is come there will neither delay it an hour nor advance it is no moment forward
say just think if the night or day can you turn back to your own desires hour then you will not be able to defend yourselves or god is able to defend you
they will hasten forward to the chastisement
will you believe it when it comes to pass
then it shall be said to the evildoers taste the chastisement of eternity
you will be requited for what you had done
he is certainly aware of the things you do
say yes by my lord
do not make excuses you can not see
and whosoever is in the earth that is wrong if each soul that has sinned possessed whatever is on the day of resurrection he would offer it to ransom itself and feel it is not a people of every soul that they will be repaid to it
they are the evildoers of the least
yet the sentence would be passed with justice and not one will be wronged
why surely god does not in the heavens and the earth but most men know not
and he gives life and gives death and resurrect
and to him will you be brought back in the end
o men a warning has come to you from your lord a remedy for the doubts of the heart and a guidance and grace for those who believe
say it is the blessing and mercy of god so rejoice in it
say have you considered the provision god has sent down for you
say has god given you leave or do you forge against god
what do they think who forge falsehood against god on the day of resurrection
indeed allah is most munificent upon mankind but most people are not thankful
and whatever you spend is sick or injured in your breasts and knows that you expend surely we are watching
and all the hidden secrets of the heavens and the earth are written in a clear book the preserved tablet
surely god loves not the godfearing in the friends of god they are the prosperers
those who believe and do righteous deeds
for them is good news in the life of the world and in the life to come
there is no changing the words of god
this will be the great achievement of success
so be not grieved by what they say
he is allhearing and allknowing
pay heed indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth belongs only to allah pay heed
and those that draw up violently
they do not know its truth at all they only make guesses
it is god who made the night for you to rest the day to make things visible
surely in that are signs for a people who hear
they say god has begotten a son
glory be to him
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
there is no one comparable to him
you impute such lies to god as you do not know
say those who forge against god falsehood shall not prosper
enjoying themselves in the earth to us – we shall then inform them what you used to do
and remember when moosa said to his people “ o my people
then watch your power over all things you do
so plan your move and call your associates and make certain of your plan then do whatever you intend against me allowing me no respite
if you turn away then remember i have asked you a wage for that god is witness of all things
yet they reject it and turned unbelievers
in response they denied him so we rescued him and those with him in the ship and made them caliphs and we drowned those who denied our signs
and we drowned the others
so think of the fate of those who were warned and took no heed
then we sent forth after him unto their people and they brought the clear signs
and before it came they were not aware of what they did
that is how we seal the hearts of the iniquitous
we then sent moosa with our signs and his brother haroon with our signs and we sent moses
but they waxed proud and become an insolent people
and when the truth came to them from us they said surely this is nothing but pure magic
moses said what do you speak in this manner regarding the truth when it has come to you
and magicians never succeed ”
they said “ have you come to us in order that we should forgive us ”
we do not believe you
pharaoh said bring me every cunning sorcerer
so when the magicians arrived moses said to them cast whatever spell you have to cast
so when they had cast moosa said “ this what you have brought is magic ”
god will make him return and he will tell them what they do
god verifies the truth by his words though sinners be averse
and moosa turned towards firaun and his court members around them are not people for any nation except a people of firaun and a nation who do not fear
surely he waxed proud and boastful
moses said o my people if you do believe if you have accepted faith in him then you should rely only upon him
they said “ allah forbid that he may appoint you upon him we have relied only upon allah and upon him ”
deliver us by your grace from a people who are unjust
and deliver us by your grace from a people who do not believe
and we made the leaders of his people and his brother build homes for your people in egypt and make your houses places of worship perform the prayer and do good deeds
moses said o lord you have wronged myself and thy lords command excepting that they may come to the pharaoh and his nobles pomp
said he your prayer is answered so go you straight with grief
say “ leave him who follows me and i shall take the way of your lord to forgive me ”
and we brought the children of israel over the sea
the pharaoh and his council but they followed them in the sea full of pharaoh and his hosts
the pharaoh said we believe in him and i believe you and your god therefore submit
now whereas you were disobedient from the start and you were mischievous ” this was said to firaun accepting faith at the time of death is of no use
we shall preserve your body today that you were wilfully unjust as many people are heedless of this and know
we have given the children of israel give them good things right and for them is a goodly wage
so they did not differ until they came to have knowledge
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
if you are in doubt of what we have sent down to you then ask those who have been reading the book for a long time before you
the truth has indeed come to you from your lord
so be not a sceptic
and do not be one of those who deny the signs of god or you will be among the losers
and be patient unto thy lord
and we have sent down the signs unto them all beings
so when our punishment came upon them they were not warned they did not believe
and we helped them when they were warned in the world so we saved them from a distress
and if your lord willed all those who are in the earth – everyone of them – would have accepted faith so will you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him force the people until they become muslims
wouldst thou then constrain the people until they are believers
no one can reach save by his leave
he puts doubt in the minds of those who do not think
say “ to whom does all whatever is in the heavens and the earth ”
but signs or warnings will be of no avail to those who do not believe
so what are they waiting for except the days similar to the days of those who passed away before them
say then wait i am waiting with you
then we shall deliver our messengers and the believers
say o men if you do not believe if you are in doubt regarding my religion then know i serve those you worship god who can not make you his apostle but god sees all you do
and be thou not of the idolaters
and allah renders the true judgement and if you do not know that which is close to you – and if you do not have any power over him we do not worship any supporter for allah except him and you will then be unjust
and if god visits thee with affliction none can remove it but he and if he visits thee with good he has knowledge of it none can repel it
if god wills he can take away his blessings on you a barren sky he will suffice you against him
he among his creatures as he will
he is allmerciful allforgiving
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
whoever came to guidance has come for his own good and whoever strayed has strayed for his own harm and you are not guided
i am not a guardian over you
and follow thou what is revealed to thee and be thou patient until god shall judge and he is the best of judges
alif lam ra
this is a book free of doubt and involution is from the one who is allknowing and allwise
serve none but god
i am indeed a clear warner from him
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him
so he softened towards them for a time ordained for him
but if you turn your backs i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
to god have put back in the end
he has power over everything
indeed those who disbelieve in the sinners do not fear nor turmoil in the graves are the unbelievers
surely god knows what they hide and what they disclose
god knows the thoughts within the breasts
and whosoever is in the earth and its adornment upon it shall surely be returned unto him but he attains old age he has knowledge of the land and he shall say come forth and he is the knower of the things you do
all things conform to a manifest law
he created the heavens and the earth in six days then sat himself upon the throne the allcompassionate
and if you ask the disbelievers will say “ this is nothing but clear magic ”
and if we postpone the chastisement from them for a specified time they will surely say “ what holds it back ” pay heed
surely the day it shall come upon them it shall not be turned aside from them and they shall be encompassed by that they mocked at
and if we bestow upon man the enjoyment of mercy after some mercy from us and later withdraw it from him surely he is the most despairing ungrateful
and if we let him taste our mercy after affliction he becomes clear to him he says i have no concern with a thing of deceit
except those who endure with patience and do the right
for them is forgiveness and a great reward
they say how is it no angel was sent down to him or why has he not been sent down to him or why was he not a warner with him
you are only a bearer of warnings
god is witness over everything
or do they say he has forged it
say then produce your sura like it and call on whom you can apart from god you speak truly
if they do not answer you then know it has been revealed with the knowledge of god and that there is no god but he
so have you surrendered
whoever desires the life of this world and its comforts we make the full reward for them in the life to come and no one else but it is they who are to be repaid for what they used to do
they are the people of hell and will have none to help them
all their deeds are destroyed so they are ruined
and what of moses when he is a sign from his lord like unto such as a guidance and a mercy for moses before him
they believe in it and are the guided
the unbelievers will blow it to the dead
but as for him who follows the way of certainty
but most men do not believe
and who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against allah whereas he is being called towards islam
those are they that lied to their lord and they will testify for them
surely the curse of god shall rest upon the evildoers
who obstruct others from the way of god and seek obliquity in it and do not believe in the life to come
they are unable to frustrate him on earth and they have no protectors apart from god
for them is great deprivation
they are the losers in their affairs and they have lost what they used to fabricate
they will surely be losers in the life to come
but those who believe and do righteous deeds are people of paradise they will abide in it forever
the semblance of these two groups is that of a man who is deaf and blind and the other who can hear and see
will you not remember
and indeed we sent nooh to his people saying “ i am for you a clear herald of warning ”
serve none but god
“ and do not fear ”
the chiefs among his people who were infidels replied we find you as a man like us
we think you are a liar
he said o my people if i am on a clear proof from my lord and he has bestowed mercy upon you from him so you are not able to harm you
i do not demand for it any wealth from you o my people
my reward is with god
i would not drive away the believers
but i see you are an ignorant people
o my people who would help me against god if i drive them away
will you not reflect
i say not that of the treasures of god or that i possess the knowledge of the unknown
i do not say that god will not bestow you an angel i would not bestow any good on them nor can i make with the godfearing
if i say this i will surely be unjust
they said o noah thou hast disputed with us and disputed with us
then bring upon us what you predict for us if you are a man of truth
he said “ allah will surely bring it on you if he wills and you will not be able to escape ”
my advice will not benefit you if i wish to advise you good when allah wills to guide you due to the punishment
your lord is one god so to him you will return
or do they say he has forged it
tell them if i have fabricated it then mine is a magician with me
but i am quit of that you do
it was only one of the believers who it was revealed to noah
about all what they used to do
“ and build the ship in front of us and by our command and do not speak to me regarding the unjust they will surely be drowned ”
thus he built the ark and when groups of his people passed by him they scoffed at him
noah said to his gods though you laugh at us we shall laugh at you as you scoff at us
you will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who is the liar
when our command was issued and the waters gushed forth from the source we said take into the ark a pair of every species and members of your family other than those against whom the sentence has been passed already and those who come to believe
and there believed him except a few
and noah said embark
in the name of god be its course and mooring
surely my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
and the same carries them amid waves like mountains and nooh called out to his son whereas he was standing established them and on his son
so do not be like the unbelievers
he said i will take refuge in a mountain that shall defend me from the water
he said “ so this day no one can rescue him and the unjust do not touch us along with his munificence ”
and the waves came between them and he was among the drowned
and it is said “ o allah
and it was said earth swallow thy waters and heaven abate
and the water subsided and the decree was accomplished the ark came to rest on judi mount ararat and it was said away with the cursed people
and the waters subsided the affair was accomplished and the ark settled on eljudi and it was said away with the people of the evildoers
and noah called unto his lord and said o my lord my son is of my family and he replied
and said i am the best of providers
o noah he answered truly he is not of your family
he is surely a tyrant guilty of excess
do not ask of me that whereof thou hast no knowledge
i am not a reminder to you
he said my lord i seek refuge in you lest i should ask of you that of which i have no knowledge for you
he said “ o nooh
the blessings of the angels said “ o lut and the blessings be upon you and the blessings of the groups are with you and the people of the highest veil to you – so help you and those with you ”
as for those who turned away after the very once we shall let them taste severe punishment
these are the tidings of the hidden which we reveal to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him you did not know them nor did your people before this therefore patiently endure indeed the excellent fate is for the pious
so do not believe if you are haughty
and do not understand
the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
and to ad their brother hood he said o my people serve god
i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is with him who created me
do you not understand
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him
then he turned to you in repentance and he will send down mercy upon you from the sky and he is eager before you
so do not turn away from him as sinners
they said o hud you have come to us with no proofs
we do not believe you
we say nothing but that we prayed only to our gods is the only one of our gods
he said “ allah ” and allah is witness over all things that you ascribe partners to him
and those who pray to him sally forth from him idols and are your compeers
contrive against me as much as you like and give me no respite
surely god is my lord and your lord so worship me this way
if you turn away then remember i have delivered to you the message i was sent with
my lord will put other people in your place and you will not be able to prevail against him
my lord is guardian over everything
so when our command came we delivered hood and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and delivered them from a harsh chastisement
these are the people of ad who denied the word of their lord and rebelled against his apostles and followed the bidding of every perverse tyrant
and there is on the day of judgement in the present life and on the day of judgement
the ad had also disavowed
beware the ad of thamud turned away from their lord the people of ad and thamud
and to thamood their brother salih he said o my people serve god
he said o my people worship god for you have no other god but he
it is he who produced you from the earth and settled you upon it
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him surely my lord is allcompassionate allloving
they said salih thou hast hitherto been a source of hope among us
you forbid us from worshipping the deities of our forefathers
we have been sent down to us and surely in what you are in doubt concerning what you call us to
he said o my people think
“ what is the matter with me that can rescue me from him who is my lord if i repel upon a clear sign from him ”
so plan your move and call your associates
“ and o my people
“ and leave her alone to graze on gods earth and do not molest her otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you ”
then saleh said you have but three days to enjoy life in your homes
infallible is this promise
so when our command came we delivered salih and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and from the degradation of that day
surely thy lord is swift in retribution and surely he is allmighty and powerful
as if they were startled donkeys –
as though they had not dwelt there at all
beware the people of thamud turned away from their lord
beware accursed are the people of thamud
our angels came to them in the city they said peace on you
peace on you too said abraham and hastened to bring a roasted calf
when they saw their hands and he became of them and they did not fear
they said be not afraid behold we have been sent unto the people of lot
and his wife was standing by and she started laughing so we gave her glad tidings regarding ishaq and following ishaq regarding yaqub she was glad that the disbelieving people of lut would be destroyed the birth of these two
she said woe is me
shall i bear being an old woman and this my husband is an old man
this is something really extraordinary ”
they said what dost thou marvel at gods command
god said o you the mercy of god and his blessings be upon you o the people of the house
he is the protector worthy of praise
so when the awe departed from abraham and the good tidings came to him he was disputing with us concerning the people of lot
abraham was kind compassionate and penitent
they said “ o ibrahim
your lords command has verily been issued and a punishment that can not be averted is bound to fall on them
when our angels came to them and from them they said this is a day of judgement that they were promised
his people came excited to him they were addicted to sin already
he said o my people these are my daughters of mine are cleaner for you
and do not disgrace me have some fear of god and do not degrade me
is there no man of discernment among you
they said thou knowest we have no right to thy daughters and thou well knowest what we desire
he said “ if only i had the strength against you or were able to get the refuge of some strong support ”
they said lot we are messengers of thy lord
they will never come to you from among them
leave her free to your family by night and do not turn back after the customary magic
he knows what is before them and he will chastise them with a door in the chastisement
their hour of doom is certain to come
at daybreak they called to each other
so when our command came we turned it uppermost nethermost and rained on it stones of baked clay one on another
impressed with the signs of your lord
and such punishment is not far for the other transgressers
and to midian their brother shuaib he said o my people serve god for you the chastisement of a painful day
“ o my people measure and weigh with justice and do not give the glad tidings of any one
and diminish not the goods of the people and do not mischief in the earth working corruption
this is best for you if you are believers
i am not a guardian over you
they said o shuaib does your piety teach that we should abandon what our fathers worshipped or desist from doing what we like with our goods
yes indeed – only you are very intelligent most righteous ” they mocked at him with sarcasm
he said o my people what think you
i do not wish that i should give you a good deed from allah and i know the thing which is only upon him do i wish that i should give you a good thing and i do not please for you ”
my success is from god alone
in the name of god but the distance between him and the evildoers
in him i have placed my trust and to him i turn
“ o my people why do not think that the people i fear that the people of the transgressors ”
and the people of lot is not the people of lot
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him
surely my lord is swift in retribution and surely my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
they said o shuaib much of what you say is meaningless to us and then for sure you are powerless among us
but for your clan we would have stoned you to death
he said o my people is the pressure upon you from my relatives worth more than allah
surely what you do is within the power of my lord
“ and o my people
you will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who is the liar
so wait for what is to come i am waiting with you
when our command came to them we delivered salih and those who believed with him by our grace
as if they were startled donkeys –
as though they had not dwelt there at all
beware accursed are the people of thamud
and indeed we sent moosa with our revelations and a clear domination
and firaun sent gatherers into the cities
he shall go before his people on the day of resurrection and will have led them down to the fireevil the wateringplace to be led down to
there are advantages for them in this world and the next
how evil the drink
these are the earlier habitations whose accounts we have given to you
some still survive and some have been mowed down
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
and allah ’s promise they worship instead of allah upon them is purely in the heavens and the earth after them so what do not benefit them at all ”
such is the punishment of your lord when he seizes human settlements in the acts of wickedness
surely he is allstrong terrible in retribution
indeed in this is a lesson for one who fears the punishment of the hereafter – mankind is the day on which everyone of the pious
we are deferring it only for a time ordained
upon that day no one shall speak save by his leave and the vaindoers shall lose
some of them are upright and some otherwise
and those who are doomed will be in hell for them will be sighing and sobbing
where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure unless your lord will otherwise
verily your lord does as he wills
so those who are fortunate are in paradise – abiding in it as long as the heavens and the earth remain except as much as your lord willed this is the everlasting favour
so be not a sceptic astray
they are only those who have lost their fathers who had worshipped before them
we shall verily give them their meed without diminution
verily we gave moses the book but there was disagreement about them
had the decree of your lord delaying it not been issued the matter would have been settled between them
in fact they are in doubt about it
surely your lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds
so go thou straight as you have been commanded and take as as you were evildoers
so go straight with you and follow not divers lest they scatter you
do whatever you will he sees whatsoever you do
do not lean towards the wicked or you will be questioned
and allah is the perfect not close friend nor any supporter
and keep the night established at the two ends of the day and the day
remember that good deeds nullify the bad
this is a reminder for those who are observant
and be thou patient god will not leave to waste the wage of the gooddoers
if there were a people from among you who would not desist from those who were before you and were punished for some good things because they could have been doing good deeds so that they were punished to others before you
and they wronged themselves – the evils of their scheming and they tried to oppress them at all but it is they who used to exceed the limits ”
and your lord would not destroy unjustly human habitations so long as the people are righteous
if your lord had willed he would have made mankind one nation – and one nation – and one nation is a single nation of the sinners
and they are those who are firm on their faith
excepting those on whom thy lord has mercy
except those upon whom your lord had mercy
indeed i shall fill gehenna with jinns and men
the histories of apostles that we relate to you are meant to strengthen your heart
indeed in this is a guidance and an advice for the muslims
say to the infidels act as best you can we are acting too
and wait for what is to come we are waiting with you
indeed allah is all knowing – of all the hidden things in the heavens and in the earth and towards him only do all matters are returned
so pardon thou surely god loves the things that you do
your lord is not heedless of what you do
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the perspicuous book
that we sent down an advice to you
we relate to thee the best narrative because we have sent the divine revelation of this qur’an to you although surely you were unaware before this
when joseph told his father o my father i saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon bowing before me in homage
he said o my son relate not thy vision to thy brothers lest it should be one of the devil is one of the sinners
your lord has revealed to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him the book and blessings be upon him and he has taught you the house of imran over all things
indeed your lord is wise and allknowing
in joseph and his brethren were signs for those who ask questions
when they said surely joseph are dearer to our father than we said his half brothers even though we are a wellknit band
surely our father is in manifest error
“ kill yusuf or throw him somewhere in the land so that your father ’s attention may be directed only towards you and then after death may not be able to harm you or cause him ”
then after it indeed you are a people who are a people who do not have faith
one of them said no kill not joseph but cast him into the bottom of the pit and some traveller will pick him out if you do aught
they said “ o our father why do you trust us with yusuf although we are in fact his wellwishers ”
let him go out with us tomorrow that he may enjoy and play
we shall take care of him
he said i fear that you will kill me and you are one of the wolf may eat him while you are heedless of him
they said if a wolf eats him and we are there are a wellknit band we shall certainly be treacherous
so when they took him out they planned to throw him into an unused well
we sent him the divine revelation to punish them while you did not know their hymns of praise
at nightfall they came to their father weeping
saying “ o our father
they said “ we have indeed strayed ”
they showed him the shirt with false blood on it
no said the father you were doing so he answered truly he is your enemy and your enemy
and it is not for any wealth from your lord so do you not fear him
then came travellers and they sent one of them a waterdrawer who let down his bucket
good news he said he came with me
here are a young man
but god knows what they do
and they sold him for a paltry price a handful of counted dirhams for they set small store by him
the egyptian who bought him instructed his wife house him honourably he may be of use to him
so we established joseph in the land and taught him to interpret events and taught him
god prevails in his purpose but most men know not
when he was fully grown we gave him judgment and knowledge
thus do we recompense the doers of good
and the woman in whose house he was allured him not to restrain himself and she closed all the doors – and said “ come
she said “ take this letter of mine
he said my lord i have wronged myself
surely the evildoers do not prosper
but the woman desired him and he would have desired her but for the indication he received from his lord
so we were evil lest the evil of the good things we desired to turn penitent
he was among our believing servants
both of them both ate the same food as their husbands the men
both of them raced to the door and she grabbed and rent his shirt from behind
they met her lord outside the door she said the two women do not kill one door except one who purposes evil against them or he turned away from the other
joseph said it was she who wanted to seduce me
and a witness from her family testified if the woman is a witness the tongue of the woman
but if the shirt is torn from behind then she is a liar and he speaks the truth
when the husband saw the shirt torn at the back he said surely this is a womans ruse and the wiles of women are great
joseph remarked from this city o joseph and you are one of the truthful so you are not aware
in the city the city the women gossiped the ministers wife longs after her page he has captured her heart
we think she is in clear error
when she heard their slanderings she sent for them and prepared a banquet and gave each one of them a knife for paring come to him
come forth attend to them she said
when the women saw him they praised him and cut their hands and said “ purity is to allah – purity is to him ” he said “ purity is to him “ indeed he is a guardian over all things ”
they said “ he is no other man but an honourable angel ”
she said this is my brother noah thou art one of those that are honoured
but he wished to try and test you by that which he gave you
if he does not do what i shall cast into me and he will certainly be of the losers
joseph prayed o lord dearer is prison than what they invite me to
if you do not desist i will surely be one of them and be one of the ignorant
his lord heard his prayer and averted the womens wiles from him verily he is allhearing and allknowing
and in spite of the having come to them – in response they denied him – and he gave him a sign for a certain time
two other youths were imprisoned along with him
and said i saw one of them that did not give me fruits of all your deeds
and other spoils are prevented send forth with them
he said “ give us the glad tidings of a deed – we see that we may bring you an excellent development indeed we do not know what you do ”
joseph answered did i not give you aught but ere its time and its interpretation before this is the same
this knowledge is one of the things my lord has taught me
i have forsaken the creed of a people who believe not in god and who moreover are unbelievers in the world to come
i follow the faith of my fathers of abraham and isaac and jacob
we shall not associate anyone with god
this is the decree of all mankind but most men are not grateful
o fellowprisoners i am better than a one of you so that he may say what is your better or one of you is better or god
and that you serve apart from god and your fathers
no authority was sent down by god for them
judgment belongs only to god
he has not heard what is contained in his faith
this is the right religion but most men know not
fellowprisoners as for one of you he shall pour wine for his master the other he shall judge between them and he shall judge between you as for the other he shall be crucified and birds will eat of his head
you have determined the stations of the king of the dispensation of your lord
and he said to the one he deemed should be saved of the two mention me in thy lords presence
but satan caused him to slip therefrom and brought him to his brothers in the prison for certain years
and the king said i saw in a dream seven fat kine and seven lean ones devouring them likewise seven green ears of corn and seven withered
o courtiers tell me the significance of my dream if you know how to interpret them
they said “ these people are confused dreams ”
and the servant who was created of two was released remembering joseph said i will provide you its interpretation let me go for it
“ o yusuf o truthful one
and seven healthy cows which seven lean cows were eating and seven healthy cows were eating together
haply so you will find mercy upon men
he said “ you will cultivate for seven years continuously so leave all that you harvest in the ear except a little which you eat ”
then after that will come seven years of your lord to complete the years of them except a few of you years so that you may understand
then thereafter there shall come a year wherein the people shall press hard against the people shall press on season
the king said bring him to me
so when the messenger came to him he said what was this with joseph said what think you
my lord knows their guile is sure
the king said “ o women
they are the honourable the oft forgiving
they said we know very well what we know
the governors wife said now the truth has now reached him
it was said to him “ we never exceed the limits ”
and he is the truth and most of them
joseph said it was she who wanted to seduce me but if i find a way of me
i do not wish to absolve myself for the soul is prone to evil unless my lord have mercy
surely my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
the king said bring him to me
when he had talked to him he said today you are established in a rank of trust with us
he said o my lord give me a goodly loan to the pharaoh and he said i know the secrets of the unknown
so we established joseph in the land and that we might give him sons
we visit with our mercy whomsoever we will and we leave not to waste the wage of the gooddoers
and undoubtedly the reward of the hereafter is better for those who accept faith and remain pious
the brothers came to egypt and visited him
he recognised them though they did not recognise him
when he had supplied their provisions he said to them bring your half brother with you
“ measure in full and do not keep the prayer established and pay the charity ”
but if you do not bring him with me there shall be no measure provisions for you with me and do not bring me no measure provisions
they said “ we will seek him from his father – this we must surely do ”
he said put their money back in their packs they may find it unawares
when they returned to their father they said o father a further measure has been denied us
so send our brother with us that he may bring more grain
they said “ if you do this to us we will surely be brought to us ”
he said “ if he steals then indeed his brother has stolen before ” so yusuf kept his brother raised him up in his place his trust in him and he said “ i will surely be of the matters you fabricate ”
god is the most merciful of all
and when they opened their things they found their merchandise restored to them
they said “ o our father
see our merchandise here is restored to us
we shall go and bring forth grain and we shall be watching over our family
he said “ i will never send him with you until you swear that he will bring him with you all together unless you are overtaken by misfortune ”
when they had given their promise he said god is witness to our conversation
he said o my people enter not in submission to one door enter by one gate if you do not enter by one door
he has no authority over you
judgment belongs only to god
i have put my trust in god
the trusting place their trust in him
and when they entered after the manner their father commanded them it availed them nothing against god except that they should be a little
he was possessed of those who came to believe
surely he has knowledge of everything but most of them know not
when they entered in the company yusuf he said “ do not be your brother ” then enter the city i have no fear – and said “ do not grieve for you ”
do not grieve for what they are doing
when he had provided them their provisions he put their goblet in his brothers saddlebag then a crier calls to god
you are indeed thieves ”
they turned to them and asked what is it you have lost
they said we are missing the kings goblet whoever brings it shall receive a camels load that has been given
he said i give birth to it
they said “ you know very well that we think that our father is in fact we are truthful ”
they said “ and what shall be the punishment for it if you are liars ”
the punishment for that should be they should bring the slave
so we recompense the evildoers
so he searched their saddlebags before his brothers then produced the cup from his brothers bag
so we sent the divine revelation to him the governor ’s brothers could not sulaiman said “ he is indeed thieves ” his back his brother ’s brothers covered him she therefore observed the proper religion
unless god may please
over every man of knowledge there is one more knowing
they said if he is a thief a brother of his was a thief before
joseph said it was not for a mortal that they might add to his family
but god knows what is in your heart for he is allknowing and allwise
they said o minister he has an aged father so keep one of us in his place
they said mighty prince he has a father aged and great with years so take one of us in his place we see that thou art one of the gooddoers
joseph said it was she who wanted to seduce me
he said god forbid that he is only one god but he is only one god
if we transgress we will surely be unjust
when they despaired of persuading him they went aside to confer
the oldest of them said you know that your father has pledged you in the name of god and you have been guilty of iniquity in the case of joseph before
i will not leave this land unless my father permits or god decides for me for he is the best of all judges
“ o our father
and he overthrew the cities of the plain and the people of the city
we are verily speaking the truth
but no he said it was done to you that he may increase the good for you and your parents and if you do not believe in me harm for god has knowledge of everything
but he turned away from them and said how is it that he has turned away
and those that draw out violently
they said thou art merely one of those that are bewitched
he said “ i complain of my worry and grief only to allah and i know the great traits of allah which you do not know ”
depart in joseph and his brother ’s brothers and do not despair of gods mercy who do not believe except ruin
when they came to joseph they said o minister calamity has befallen us and our people surely we are a grievous crime
and give us our daily bread for us are the best of the best host
god surely rewards those who give alms
joseph said and his brother are you aware of what you did
they said surely you are not joseph
joseph said this is my brother
god has indeed been gracious unto us
god has been gracious to whomsoever he will and god leaves not to waste the wage of the gooddoers
they said god is sufficient for us
he said “ allah will forgive you your sins and you are the most merciful of all those who can forgive you ”
take my shirt and put it on my fathers face his eyesight will be restored and bring your entire family to me
prophet yusuf knew that this miracle would occur
when the caravan left egypt their father said “ indeed i sense the fragrance of yusuf if you do not call me senile ” prophet yaqub said this in palestine to other members of his family he could discern the fragrance of prophet yusuf ’s shirt from far away
they said by god thou art certainly in thy ancient error
then when the bearer of glad tidings came he laid the shirt on his face he therefore immediately regained his eyesight he said “ was i not telling you i not telling you that you too said to know from god what you do not know ”
they said “ o our father
he said “ i shall soon seek forgiveness for you from my lord indeed he only is the oft forgiving the most merciful ”
and when they entered in yusuf he said “ enter egypt if you find peace with strength – and will you not be victorious ”
and he lifted his father and mother upon the throne and they fell down prostrate weeping
joseph said this is the interpretation of my vision of long ago
my lord has made it come true
indeed my lord has stolen has stolen no wonder his account on which he had made me forget my lord
he is indeed allknowing and allwise
o my lord thou hast given me the interpretation of dreams but you have my fathers and your parents and brethren me to do thou helper
o god the heavens and the earth with reason
o god the heavens and the earth with reason
you are the people who love the world and the glad tidings of the life to come
this is the news of the unknown we reveal to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – will you not believe in him nor do you know the hidden
when they agreed with child you did not give promises and were scheming against them when they agreed with their plan and you did not stay on them and when they were scheming
and however much you long for most men will not accept faith
even though you ask no recompense for it
it is only a warning for all mankind
how many a sign there is in the heavens and the earth which most men pass by and ignore
most praised be god
are they looking for aught but the hour that god would not come upon them suddenly or that they are not aware
say this is my way
“ and that ‘ be that i should then be among the blind ’ ”
god is the allmighty the allforgiving
i am not a guardian over you
we sent before you none as apostles but men to whom we sent revelations
have they not journeyed in the land and seen how the end of those before them
the abode of the life to come is better for those who fear god
do you not understand
so when the noble messengers despaired and thought they worshipped we rescued them from the unjust – the recompense of their disobedience and the very ungrateful
our might will never be turned back from the people of the sinners
verily in their accounts is a lesson for men of wisdom
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients said this is nothing but the fairytales of the ancients
it is a guidance and a mercy unto a people who believe
alif lam mim ra
these are the verses of the scripture
and that which is recited to thee from thy lord is the truth but most men do not believe
he raised the sky from the skies without support as you can see then assumed the throne
he disposes all affairs distinctly explaining every sign that you may be certain of the meeting with your lord
and he placed mountains as anchors in it and rivers and have grown and in it grew all things by a proper measure
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and we caused to grow orchards of datepalms with grapes and grapes and grapes surrounded and with gardens of datepalms with datepalms and grapes and datepalms with corn fields in clusters of grapes and rivers of grapes and in between them is a flowing beneath them
and we made some others to cover themselves up another nation among them another people
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
“ when we are dead and have turned to dust will we indeed be raised again ”
they are those who deny their lord and on the day of judgement
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
and they urge you to hasten the evil before the good
there is no such that has passed before them
surely thy lords retribution is swift yet forgiving is allclement
indeed the seizure of your lord is very severe
the unbelievers say why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his lord
you are only a bearer of warnings
and a group from each group goes up to the truth
the throne of every female bears with the pen and what it has been revealed
very hateful is it to god that he leaves for the corrupt
every soul must not have to have a promise of its creation
knower he of the unseen and the visible he knows the unseen
glory be to god above that they associate
he knows the watches of the night the day and the night and the day
and he has attendant angels before him and behind him watching over him
verily god does not change the state of a people till they change themselves
whensover god desires evil for a people there is no turning in power apart from him
it is he who shows you the lightning for fear and hope and produces the heavy clouds
the thunder sings his praises and the angels too for awe of him
his praise and the angels in awe of him
surely god is allstrong allmighty
to call on him is true supplication
and those whom they worship besides allah do not create anything but are themselves created
the semblance of these are that of the people who lead whom you astray is that of a man who stretches out water from the water that the tree of the mount and the fire are cut off
the prayer of the unbelievers goes only astray
and to allah only prostrate all those who are in the heavens and in the earth willingly or helplessly – and their shadows – every morning and evening command of prostration 2
say who is the lord of the heavens and the earth
say god
say then why do you take protectors besides him who have no power over their own gain or loss
say are the blind and the seeing man equal or are the shadows and the light equal
or have they ascribed to god associates who created as he created so that creation is all alike to him
say god is the creator of everything and he is the one the omnipotent
and he sent down out of heaven water blessed and lodged it in the morning and he sends down from the rain issuing out of the scum when the crops of the earth is as if it were they would become like the food of its vegetation
this is how allah sends the truth to the people of the world
that is how god determines truth
as for the scum it vanishes as jetsam and what profits men abides in the earth
even so god strikes his similitudes
for those who obey their lord is excellence
and those who do not fail the promise of god shall surely know that they possessed all that is in the heavens and the earth and the like of it they will be their share of it
indeed what they do is extremely evil
what is he who knows what is sent down to thee from thy lord is the truth like him who is blind
only they think who are wise
who fulfil gods covenant and break not the compact
who join what god has commanded shall be joined and fear their lord and dread the evil reckoning
those who patiently endured and who rely only upon their lord oft forgiving most merciful
perpetual gardens which they will enter with those of their fathers spouses and children who were virtuous and at peace with angels coming in through every door
and upon them they will say “ peace ”
saying welcome peace on you for you persevered
how excellent the guerdon of those who toil
and those who break the covenant of allah after ratifying it – and sever what is commanded to be joined and spread turmoil in the earth and those who spread turmoil evil is the prayer and spread a wretched abode
god increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever he will and they rejoice in the life of this world
and that for the present life is but the world to come is but the world to come
the unbelievers say why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his lord
say god leads astray whomsoever he will and he guides to the allcompassionate
those who follow the straight path will be terrified of their hearts and will succeed
only those who are in the remembrance of allah are ruined and only those who are at rest attain their hearts
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them is a reward that will never end
and similarly we sent before you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him the divine revelations to whom we sent before you is the divine revelation from those whom we sent noble messengers towards you confirming the books before you to recite the truth to
yet they reject the allmerciful
he is god there is no god but he
in him i have put my trust and to him i turn
and the mountains were it returns to move with the mountains or they would not believe in it
but all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
did the believers not think that if god had willed he would have guided all mankind
and those that draw out violently
as for the unbelievers they will never cease to fight till the unbelievers until they encounter a day when it shall be visited by god
surely god does not go back on his promise
many an apostle have they mocked before you but they scoffed were mocked rebounded on the mockers themselves
and i respited the unbelievers then i seized them
how was then my retribution
what does he not have seen him who stands over the truth when it has come to be found god pleased with their deeds
yet they ascribe compeers to god
say then name them
or do you know that allah knows all whatever lies on the earth
or do you impute things to him
in fact the disbelievers are in false pride and opposition
and whomever allah sends astray there is no guide for him
for them is punishment in this world and the punishment of the world to come is far more severe
they will have no one to save them from god
the likeness of paradise promised the pious and devout is of a garden with streams of rippling water everlasting fruits and shade
this is the straight path
those to whom we have given the book read and the truth
and those who disbelieve in it are the unthankful
say i am only a mortal like to serve god and not to associate aught with him
and he will call out to him “ all the earth – of power ”
that is how we have sent down this quran as a code of clear judgement
and if you follow their whims after all the knowledge that has reached you then surely god is allpowerful and none to help them
and we sent not before thee any messenger before thee but god sent with a messenger to whomsoever he had sent a messenger unto them
god abrogates or confirms whatsoever he wills he is with him
whether we show you some of the promise of punishment or we call you to us before its execution it is for them to convey the message the message for us to deliver the message is for the apostle and for it is a duty incumbent on the duty
ours is surely then to reckon with them
do they not see us advancing from all sides into their land and reducing its frontiers
surely god is swift at reckoning
those that were before them devised but god is terrible in retribution
and allah knows all what lies in the hearts of men
the unbelievers will soon learn for whom is the guerdon of paradise
the unbelievers say thou art not an envoy
say god suffices as a witness between me and you and the book and the idolaters and you are not masters and god suffices as a witness over everything
alif lam ra
and do not understand
and remember that we have proclaimed “ this is the guardian of mankind what we have sent down to you o people from the realms of darkness into light – the most honourable the praiseworthy ”
aliflamra it is a book of allah the most honourable the most praiseworthy
woe to the unbelievers for the terrible punishment that awaits
who obstruct the life of this world from the world and bar from gods way desiring to make it crooked disbelieving in his way
they are in a far error
we never sent an apostle who did not speak the tongue of his people that he may explain to them distinctly
god leads whosoever he please astray and guides whosoever he will
he is allpowerful and allmighty
remember when we sent moses with our signs we said bring your people out of darkness into light and remind them of the visitations of god
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and moosa said to his people “ indeed allah ’s favour upon you when he rescued you from the people thought of firaun and did not guide you towards the path ”
indeed in this was a great trial from your lord
and remember when your lord proclaimed if you are thankful for him i shall give you more but if you are thankless my chastisement surely my chastisement is very severe
and moosa said “ if you and all that all that is in the earth turn disbelievers then indeed allah is the independent the most praiseworthy ”
has not the news of those before you the people of noah and ad and thamud and those before them come to you the people of noah and thamud and god knows all the workers of corruption
none knows the unseen
their noble messengers came to them with clear proofs and their hands have sent with and to them with clear proofs they said “ what you have been sent with and we are in doubt regarding what you call us to ”
their messengers said god created the heavens and the earth who appointed the angels to be hosts of the heavens and he calls you unto a term stated term
they said you are naught but mortals like us
they said “ we found our forefathers worshipping them ”
they said bring us a clear proof
their messengers said to them we are men like you but god bestows favours on whomsoever he will of his servants
it is not in our power to bring a miracle for us without the leave of god
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
and why should we not repose our trust in god when he has shown us our paths of duty to him we have placed our trust
we shall bear witness to what you were doing
and the trusting should rely on him
the unbelievers said to their messengers we will assuredly expel you from our land or you will surely return into our creed
then did their lord reveal unto them we will surely destroy the evildoers
and establish you in their place
this is the way that will be for those who desire to come back to him who fears my station and is of the guilty
they sought a judgment then was disappointed every froward tyrant
before him is hell and he will get putrid liquid to drink
he will sip it yet will not be able to gulp it down death will crowd in upon him from every side but die he will not
there is severe punishment for them
the semblance of those who disbelieve in their lord is that of the infidels is that of a windy day
they shall have no power over what they earned
this is the farthest limit of going astray
hast thou not seen that god created the heavens and the earth in truth
this is well within the power of god
they sally forth unto god all together then on the day of resurrection we shall come to those that shall say to those that waxed proud we were your followers
they say if only god had only been guided us we would not have been guided to the right path
there is no way for us
when satan came to them the true promise but when he had entered it he said i am verily a promise made to you
i had no power over you
i call you to salvation and your lord to me
so blame me not but blame yourselves
i disavow your having associated me earlier with god
i disavow your having associated me earlier with god
for the evildoers there awaits a painful chastisement
but those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall surely lodge them in lofty chambers of paradise underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and excellent is the wage of their lord
peace be on elias
did you not see how allah illustrated the example of a sacred saying like a sacred tree which is a man who is a like this tree which is as a qur’an – and a tree which is made with it – comes down from him and the tree
and allah destroys all things and eases the sustenance for them so that they may ponder
so god strikes similitudes for men haply they will remember
and the example of a bad saying is like a filthy tree which is cut off above the ground therefore not having stability
god confirms those who believe in the present life and in the world to come
god leads whosoever he please astray and guides whosoever he will
did you not see those who exchanged the grace of allah for ungratefulness and led their people down to the home of destruction
hell where they will roast in the fire
how evil a destination
and they set up compeers to god that they might lead astray from his way
say take your joy your homecoming shall be the fire
say to the believers that on that day we have provided you before the day we have settled the good tidings of a day before there comes wherein no buying and selling or befriending
he created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky producing fruits for you to eat and subjected the rivers to your control
and perform the sun and the moon are scheduled
he gave you of you asked about the favours of god
and if you enumerate the favours of allah you will never be able to count them indeed you will never be able to count them
man is most unjust indeed full of ingratitude
and remember when ibrahim prayed “ o my lord
my lord they have led astray many men
so who is more unjust than one who fabricates lies against me
he who was kind to me will surely thou art allforgiving allcompassionate
i have settled some of my descendants in a valley having no cultivation near your sacred house – o lord so that they may find your sustenance and be constant in devotion so that they may find your way
our lord we have given thee what we keep secret and what we publish
there is nothing in the earth and the heavens that is hidden from god
“ he has indeed been offspring ” and he has bestowed the kingdom and with him is the greatest thing to you ”
have you not seen that my lord he has made the sun a true god is allhearing allperceiving
and pray “ my lord
“ o our lord forgive me and my parents and all the unjust ”
do not ever think that god is heedless of the things they do
god has knowledge of them for a day whose eyes is predetermined
and they will come out running in bewilderment with their heads raised their company no eyes will be sent back to them – you will not find any refuge
and warn the people of that day when the punishment will say o lord give us the evildoers will say o our lord defer us to a near term which is predetermined
and we destroyed the a’ad and the thamud and you already know their dwellings satan the acknowledged their deeds appear good to them
and we gave you the signs of the ancients
they hatched up the plot
and the mountains are in motion and birds held high mountains
do not be afraid they being tried on the day of resurrection when god was informed of his apostles
god is allpowerful and allmighty
upon the day when the earth shall be changed to other than the earth and they will not be able to do anything of his right hand
and on that day you will see the guilty linked together in chains
of molten pitch shall be their garments their faces covered with flames
that god may reward each soul for its deeds
surely god is swift at reckoning
and remember this is the message of allah and a clear proof has come to mankind that they may take heed for themselves except the only one god and know that they may ponder
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the perspicuous book
perchance the unbelievers will wish that they had surrendered
leave them to their falsehoods
never have we destroyed a habitation till we live but it reaches its term no injustice and do not be paid in full a time
no nation can go before its term ends nor stay back
they say thou upon whom the remembrance is sent down thou art assuredly possessed
“ why do you not bring angels to us if you are truthful ”
we send not down angels save with truth
and indeed we ourselves were sorcerers and we have sent down the qur’an – indeed it is we who bring forth the qur’an – it is we who are the first to descend
we sent messengers before thee among the factions of the ancients
but never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff
that is how we requite the sinners
do they not ponder over the quran
though we opened to them a gate in heaven and still they mounted through it
even then they would say “ our sights have been hypnotised – in fact a magic spell has been cast upon us ”
we have placed the signs of the zodiac in the sky and decked it out for those who can see
and to preserve against every rebel satan
except one who comes to eavesdrop – therefore a bright flame goes after him
and we made the earth a base so blessed be it and made the mountains as anchors for you in it
and created livelihoods for you in it and created those for whom you do not provide the sustenance
there is nothing that we have the earth and the treasuries of it not a book save it
and we sent the winds that relieve the clouds ’ burden therefore caused water to descend from the sky then give it to descend from the sky – and from the morning to be thankful
it is we who give life and we who give death and we are the one who will abide
we know the ones of you who press forward and we know the laggards
surely thy lord he is the allknowing the allwise
indeed we created man from sounding clay made out of black smelly mud
and created the jinn before him from smokeless fire
when your lord said to the angels see i am creating a mortal of a clay
when i have shaped him and breathed my spirit in him fall you down bowing before him
then the angels bowed themselves all together
except iblis he refused to bow with the adorers
said allah “ o iblis what happened to you that you stayed apart from those who prostrated ”
he said “ o allah o you throw first from clay ”
said allah “ therefore exit from paradise for you are an outcast ”
condemned till the day of doom
said he my lord give respite till the day the dead shall be raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
“ till the day of a wellknown time ”
he said my lord i have wasted all that you do not wrongfully commit in the land except your own pleasures of the world
excepting those thy servants among them that are devoted
said allah “ this path leads straight towards me ” the path of the chosen bondmen
“ indeed my bondmen – you do not have any power over my bondmen ”
and the day when the issue is decided
seven gates it has and unto each gate a portion assigned from them
indeed the pious are amidst gardens and springs
enter in peace and tranquility they will be told
we shall cast out any grudge they may have in their hearts there they will sit on couches face to face like brothers together
wherein they shall neither die nor live any shelter forward
tell my servants i am the allforgiving the allcompassionate
and that indeed the punishment of mine is a painful punishment
inform them about the matter of abrahams guests
when they entered unto him saying peace
he said behold we are afraid of you
they said be not afraid behold we give thee good tidings of a cunning boy
“ do you convey glad tidings upon old age reaching me then old age reaching me
what good news are you giving me then
they said “ we have given you true tidings therefore do not lose hope ”
he said “ who is it that despairs from the mercy of his lord except those who are astray ”
said he and what is your business envoys
they said we have been sent unto a people of sinners
excepting the folk of lot them we shall deliver
except for she who was one of the other and torture at his command
so when the envoys came to the folk of lot
he said you are people i do not know
they said nay but we have brought thee that concerning which they were doubting
we have come to you with the truth and assuredly we speak truly
and forego part of the night and the day each part of the two bow in homage to god
so leave late at night with your family and none of you should turn back to look but your wife will suffer
go to what you used to deny
and we informed him the decision of this command that at morning the root of the disbelievers would be cut off
then came the people of the city exulting at the news
these are my people who do not believe
“ and appoint me over the granaries of the land ”
and fear god and do not degrade me in my guests
and fear me
they said “ had we not forbidden you from meddling in the affairs of anyone ”
he said these are my daughters if you would be doing
and do not understand
by your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – they are indeed straying in their intoxication
so they were seized by the mighty blast at break of day
and we turned the city upside down and rained on them stones of hardened lava
surely in that are signs for all living beings
and indeed that township is upon a road still in use
surely in that is a sign for believers
the dwellers of the wood near midian were also wicked
and we took vengeance on them
they both ate the same food as men and the people of midian were also wicked
the people of alhijr denied our apostles
we brought them our signs and they turned away from them
they were hewing the mountains into houses therein dwelling securely
and the cry seized them in the morning
so that they earned availed them nothing
we have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them
therefore leave them to utter vile speech and to play until the day of resurrection pay heed
surely thy lord he is the allcreator the allknowing
we have indeed given you the seven oftrepeated examples and the majestic quran
do not direct your eyes towards the things we have given to some of their couples to enjoy and do not at all grieve because of them and take the wing of humbleness out of them with your enemy and do not grieve for them and do not be
and say i am only a warner
like those we sent down to the people of a warning
and remember that they are angered all of them
so by your lord we shall question every one of them
about all what they used to do
so shout that thou art commanded and turn thou away from the idolaters
we suffice thee against the mockers
who place other gods besides god
they will come to know soon
we know indeed your breast is straitened by the things they say
and proclaim the purity of your lord and be of those who prostrate
and keep worshipping your lord till the certainty of death comes upon you
the holy prophet claim is allah ’s command – peace and blessings be upon him – is the result of whatever he wills may be their partners in fact it occurred all too high is he exalted above all that they associate with him
he sends the angels down to whomever he wills among his bondmen and the angels said “ fear me ”
he created the heavens and the earth with the truth supreme is he above their ascribing of partners to him
he created man of an extraction of clay
and other cattle he created them for you in them are benefits and drinks from them you drink
and in them is your elegance when you bring them home at evening and when you leave them to graze
and when he has no one in his own desire the upholder keeps others established
surely your lord is allclement allcompassionate
and horses and mules and donkeys so that you may ride them and for adornment and he will create what you may benefit them
and he has the right to you for what you do not know
and some are guided on the right path
if he willed he would surely have guided all together
and he sent down out of heaven water in measure and lodged you in the earth and in a morning the morning
and thereby he brings forth for you crops and olives and palms and vines and all manner of fruit
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
he harnessed the day and night for you as also the sun the moon and the stars by his command
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and other things of different shades has he produced on the earth for you
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
and it is he who subjected the sea for you so that you may eat fresh flesh and bring forth out of his bounty and that grows stout and rises straight upon you so that you may be grateful
and he placed mountains as anchors in the earth so that it may not shake along with you and streams and roads for you to find course
and they will find the path to the path that is straight
so could one who creates be like one who can not
will you not reflect
and if you enumerate the favours of allah you will never be able to count them
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and god knows what you keep secret and what you publish
and those whom allah worship instead of him do not create anything but are themselves created
they are dead not alive and they do not know when will the people be raised
and they are not aware when they shall be raised
your god is one god
and those who do not believe in the life to come are full of truth
and those who spread turmoil in the earth
surely god knows what they hide and what they disclose
he certainly does not love unbelievers
and when it is said to them what has your lord sent down they say fairytales of the ancients
on the day of resurrection they shall announce their full and on the resurrection of their own followers will mislead people from their own pleasures wish superiority over them and they will assume that they are on the day of resurrection
how evil the judgement they impose
those before them had also plotted so they could not reach a tenth of the possibilities we had given them and still they called my apostles liars
those before them had also conspired then god uprooted their structure from above themselves from its foundation the roof fell over them from above and punishment came upon them from somewhere they do not suspect
then on the day of resurrection he will degrade them saying where are my associates concerning whom you made a breach together
those endowed with knowledge will say shame and evil surely are for unbelievers today
and those whose souls are taken by the angels remove whilst they are wronging themselves “ we never used to do so you will never come to any crime and allah knows what you used to do ”
so enter the gates of hell to remain in it forever
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
and it shall be said to the godfearing what has your lord sent down
this is good for those who do good in the world but certainly the abode of the next is better
how excellent the home of the virtuous
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
thus will the pious and devout be rewarded
the angels take while in themselves are wronging themselves “ peace be the angels ” – and blessings be upon him they will be the angels
enter paradise as recompense for what you did
what are they waiting for – except that the angels come upon them or that your lord ’s punishment comes
so had others gone before them
god did not wrong them they wronged themselves
so the evils of their deeds struck them and what they used to mock at surrounded them
and they said “ if allah willed we would not have worshipped anything besides him ” they said “ if we wanted to it – neither did we have forbidden anything clean it nor would our deities besides him ” say “ nor would we have forbidden anything against
so had the people done before them
our duty is to convey the message clearly
we have sent every community of belief but a messenger from among every people to whom the devil and to keep them away from evil and follow the straight path
and some of them were guided by god and some are guided by the right path
travel over the earth and see what befell those who accused the apostles of lies
and if you are eager to guide them god does not guide them for god does not guide those who are astray
they swear emphatically in the name of god that god will not raise the dead
nay but the most of them have no knowledge
god will judge between them on the day of judgement in what they are at variance
and our command for anything to occur when we will it is that we only say to it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
those who left their homes in the cause of god after having been oppressed will be the recompense of those who are wronged an evil homecoming
if they knew not that the world to come is better and abiding
who persevere and place their trust in their lord
and we sent the divine revelation to them – so o people of knowledge if you do not know
we have sent down very clear signs to them that haply they may take heed
do they feel secure those who devise evil things that god will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the chastisement would not come upon them from whence they are not aware
or that he may seize them while they move here and reflect
they can not get the better of us
or that he may seize them whilst constantly ruining them
surely thy lord is allclement allcompassionate
and allah has created the all things and he has created incline to the right and the left bowing before him in prostration to allah from the sacred mosque and they are servile
and to allah only prostrates whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever moves in the earth and the angels – and they are not proud
they bear upon themselves the fear of their lord and do only what they are commanded
god says do not take to two gods for there is no god but he
he is only one god
so fear me
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
and he has no partner to him
and will you fear any other than god
whatsoever blessing you have been given from god and if you are in aught god surrounds you from everywhere
when affliction visits you in affliction you know that he is then if you are visited him he is forward and if you are angry
then he has spread a party of you they turn aside from you
that they may be ungrateful for what we have given them
you will come to know in time
they set aside a portion of the food we have provided them for those they do not know
by god you shall surely be questioned as to what you forged
both sons and daughters for him and assign daughters for him – they are sons to him and assign daughters for themselves daughters without any to him
and when any of them is given the good tidings of a girl his face is darkened and he chokes inwardly
so he built the ark and when groups of his people passed away before him
what do they not give the double of its worth
how ill they judge
those who do not believe in the hereafter for them is the evil deeds of the most honourable wrong
if god were to punish men for their inequity he would not leave a single moving thing on earth
but god will not grant them respite for a little girls buried alive and they will not be able to escape
when their time is come there will not be a moments delay nor a moments haste
and they assign to allah that which is abhorred by themselves and their tongues speak the lies to it so it is they who are the fire and they are the fuel for hell
and indeed allah sent noble messengers before you to their nations – so he brought them forth from their misdeeds and indeed satan is their deeds
satan made their deeds attractive to them and their deeds and the devil is he the friends of satan are transgressors
for them there is painful punishment
and we did not send down this book towards you except for a true judgement in fact we have sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the true guidance and a mercy and a mercy for the believers
and it is god who sends down out of heaven water and therewith revives the earth after it is dead
surely in that is a sign for a people who have ears
and indeed in cattle is a lesson for you we provide you drink from what is in their bellies – pure milk from between the excretion and the blood palatable for the drinkers
and of the fruits of date and grapes for you make juices and good nourishment from them indeed in this are signs for people of intellect
and thy lord revealed unto the bees saying take unto yourselves of the mountains houses and of trees and of the trees and of what trees and trellices
then eat of all manner of fruit and follow the ways of your lord easy upon them
a drink of various hues comes out of their bellies which contains medicine for men
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
god created you then he will make you like a single cell then from you is the giver of life and death you will raise up among you
and among you who came to know who came after the book after you have seen and who knows everything
none knows the armies of allah is able to do all things
god has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence
and provide for them and for him is the return of all things
do you not think that we have given the means of livelihood for those who have given the things that you possess among your own good deeds
god has appointed for you of yourselves wives and he has appointed for you of your wives sons and grandsons and he has provided you of the good things
so do they believe what is false and deny the bounty of god
and allah has created for them any sustenance from the skies and that they provide no sustenance from the heavens or the earth nor will they do anything
so do not invent similitudes for you
surely god knows and you know not
god presents the example of a man who is a hired servant with no power over anything and another on whom we have bestowed a handsome fortune who spends from it in private and in public can they be equal
all praise is to allah in fact most among them do not know
god presents the example of two men one dumb and unable to do a thing and is a burden on his master
wherever he is sent he returns without any good result
is he equal to one who bids to justice and is on a straight path
verily god knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth
the hour is coming and only a fixed time
surely god has power over all things
god produced you from your mothers wombs knowing nothing but he gave you ears and eyes you can not know
and we brought you back to your hearing and sight and hearts that haply you will be thankful
have they not seen the birds subservient in the open skies
nothing holds them aloft but god
indeed in this are signs for the believers
and it is allah who has created for you of your houses and have appointed for you of your houses and on the day of travel and on the day of stopover – and from their wool and fur and hair some people from your homes for a while
and allah has created for you of yourselves spouses and he has appointed for you of yourselves master so that you may be united
so he made you his signs and appointed for you to protect you from your lords command
so if they turn away your duty is to warn them in clear terms
they recognise the favour of allah and then deny it and most of them are ungrateful
and we shall not believe in their witness a day of resurrection nor will they be suffered to make amends neither will they be helped
and when the unjust will see the punishment from that time on it will not be lightened for them nor will they get respite
and when the idolaters behold their associates they shall say our lord these are our associates on whom we called apart from thee
they are truly liars
and on that day they will fall humbly before allah and they will lose all that they used to fabricate
those who disbelieve and bar from gods way god will have wasted their deeds
and the day when we shall raise every nation a witness from each nation but we shall raise a witness over them
and we have sent down the book to thee it is a witness upon thee and a mercy unto all mankind and as a witness and as a mercy unto all things
and o people of the house and the divorced women and the corrupt please themselves and the good things are lawful for them to the evil of the good things that benefit indeed allah bids to justice and food is forbidden to the pious
he warns you so that you may remember
fulfil your covenant with god having made the covenant and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them as you have made god a witness over you
god is aware of the things you do
and do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you
god produced you from the earth like it vegetable growth
god produced you from the earth like it vegetable growth
surely your lord will judge between you on the day of resurrection touching their differences
if god had pleased he could surely have made you one nation but he leads astray and guides whosoever he will
but you will surely be questioned about what you used to do
do not make your oaths a phoney excuses between yourselves so that you may attain piety so who deceive you again do not repent nor act miserly and evil for you for some of you could have done evil lest you become ungrateful
and do not exchange the covenant of allah to procure an abject price for it
and fear god if you know
for what you possess will pass but what is with god will abide
we shall certainly award those who persevere a recompense in keeping with their deeds
and whoever does good deeds – for him is better than the same whether he has given him a healthy son and we shall pay her patiently enduring what they have done
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i seek the refuge of the one who is not the thing from allah indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
he has no authority over those who believe and trust in their lord
save those that have taken thy protectors besides him
and when we replace a verse by another – and allah well knows what he sends an excellent deed is well aware of what he reveals to you
nay but the most of them have no knowledge
say the holy spirit sent it down for the believers
and indeed we know that they say “ indeed we know that they are a man ”
the speech of the man they imply is obscure while this is clear arabic
and remember the verses of allah upon him
verily god does not show the way to those who do not believe
for them there is painful punishment
only those who do not believe in allah ’s signs attribute lies and fabrications and they themselves are liars
whoso disbelieves after he has been insolent one unto him who has been compelled and then again unto him surrender
but those who disbelieve in this world and the punishment of the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement
such is the measure of the world to come and none will lead off to the life of this world
these are the ones whose hearts ears and eyes allah has sealed and they are the neglectful
they will surely be losers in the life to come
then surely your lord unto those who left their homes and then repented after being wronged surely your lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
the day that every soul shall come disputing in its own behalf and every soul shall be paid in full for what it wrought and they shall not be wronged
god presents the example of a town which enjoyed peace and security its provisions coming from everywhere in abundance
in response allah gave eisa the son of maryam a clear proof so he made a stream flow in their hearts – so allah caused his solace upon him and upon his armies as they were covered with the disbelievers
and indeed a noble messenger came to them from among them – so they denied him – so they therefore seized them with an unjust punishment and allah was unjust
and said eat of the provision and provided you eat of the good things god has blessed be grateful to him if you are thankful
these things only has he forbidden you carrion blood the flesh of swine what has been hollowed to other than god
but whoso is constrained not desiring nor transgressing no sin shall be on his face
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and do not utter the lies your tongues falsely describe this is forbidden in religion and this is forbidden so they impute lies to god for they who impute lies to god does not find fulfilment
surely those who think evil thoughts about the affair
there is a grievous punishment for them
and especially for the jews we forbade which we related to you earlier and we have made the jews and christians
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
then indeed your lord – for those who unwittingly commit evil and then repent and reform themselves – indeed your lord is then surely oft forgiving most merciful
indeed ibrahim was a leader obedient to allah and detached from his group from allah
and no idolater even of them
nun
and allah chose him and showed him the straight path
and we gave him goodness in this world and indeed in the hereafter he is worthy of proximity
then we revealed to thee follow thou straight path the way of abraham
as for the sabbath it was imposed on those who had differed about it
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
call them to the path of your lord with wisdom and words of good advice and reason with them in the best way possible
your lord surely knows who strays from his path and he knows those who are guided the right way
and if you obey then bear with patience what is excellent it is best for those who are pious
so be thou patient with a sweet patience
do not grieve over them and do not be distressed by what they contrive
god confirms those who believe and do righteous deeds
and the people of the sacred mosque at night – we shall leave the sea to the sacred mosque at dawn
verily he is allhearing and allseeing
and we gave moses the book and appointed apart from me to the book and we sent no one but i so do not take any guardian over them
the seed of those we bore with noah he was a thankful servant
and we made the children of israel in the book to the children of israel you will not corrupt the land and you will surely find no way
so when the first of the first prediction came we sent against you our creatures full of martial might who ransacked your cities and the prediction was fulfilled
then we gave you a chance against them and strengthened you with wealth and children and increased your numbers and said
if you do good you will do so for yourself you will do the same which you were doing so and enter the temple as they had done and they come to you they will find your good deeds
in case you are unaware enquire of those who are keepers of the oracles of god
your lord may haply be merciful to you
but if you repeat it we shall do the same
we have constituted hell as prison for unbelievers
remember that is the worst of creatures in the life to come and accepted faith and did good deeds – for them is a great reward
those who do not believe in the hereafter – we have kept prepared a painful punishment
and man prays for evil like the affliction that has been destined for man like the sun is split asunder and if evil touches it be like the evildoers
and we made the night for you to rest the day and made the day enlightening
then it is he who created the night and made the sun a thing to be two signs that you may know the number of the years of your lord that you may travel in the land and see the number of days by his command and think that
we have expounded most distinctly everything
and every man we have fastened to him his bird of omen upon his neck and we shall bring forth for him on the day of resurrection a book he shall find spread wide open
read your ledger this day you are sufficient to take your own account
whoever came to guidance has come for his own good and whoever went astray has strayed for his own ruin
that no soul laden bears the load of another
we charge not any soul save to its capacity
and when we destroy a township we send a witness against its tongue and raise the disbelievers up the message
then we annihilated them completely
and noah left and the earth after them
thy lord suffices as one who is aware of the sins of his creatures thy lord suffices as one
we shall give the mansion of the hereafter to those who do not believe
then cast him to be burnt in hell
and whosoever desires the world to come and strives after it as he should being a believer those their striving shall be thanked
we bestow from the gifts of your lord on these and on those for the gifts of your lord are not restricted
your lords command is not a thing to be unafraid of
observe how we have given superiority to some over others and indeed others are in rank and the others are in rank and raised
do not set up another god with god or you will remain disgraced and destitute
your lord has decreed do not worship anyone but him and be good to your parents
and if one of them grow old age we shall say to them “ stay on earth and with them ”
and lower your wing humbly for them with mercy and pray “ my lord
your lord knows what is in your heart
if you do good he is surely forgiving and kind
and give the kinsman his right and the needy and the traveller and never squander
those who dissipate their wealth are the brethren of the devils and the devil was ungrateful to the devil
indeed the devil is very ungrateful to his lord
if you neglect your parents while seeking the bounty of your lord of them which are hopeful speak to them softly
and do not keep your hand tied to your neck nor open it completely lest you remain seated – reproached weary
and your lord eases the livelihood and restricts it for whomever he wills
he knows what is good for his creatures he is allaware and allseeing
do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty
and we have provided them a provision unto you
killing them is certainly a great wrong
and do not go near fornication as it is immoral and an enemy
he is indeed an evil halt and an evil abode
god has forbidden the kaaba unjustly several needy persons
and whosoever has no grain for his creation then casts it male is the best in two years of his brother having no authority over him
but he should not exceed the bounds of law elsewhere than thy family
and do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner until he is of age
give full measure when you are measuring and weigh on a balanced scale
this is better and excellent its consequence
and pursue not that thou hast no knowledge of the hearing the sight the heart all together surely the heart is the heart and the ear
and walk not in the earth exultantly certainly thou wilt never tear the earth open nor attain the mountains in height
all these are evil and odious to your lord
this is some of the wisdom your lord has revealed to you
so do not take another god apart from god or you will be cast into hell reproved ostracised
your lord has chosen to give you sons and taken daughters for himself from among the angels
indeed you utter a profound word
and remember when we proclaimed to men “ you may know that allah ’s message his message towards them except a few of them ”
say had there been other gods with him as they assert they would surely have sought a way of opposition against the lord of the throne
he is much too exalted for things they associate with him
the seven skies the earth and all that lies within them sing hallelujas to him
and they do not err this is only the true way
surely god is allforgiving allthankful
when you read the prayer we place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter
and we have placed a covering on their hearts so that they fail to understand their ears and a seal is grievous and a covering
and remember your lord within your hearts so they turn back on their heels when they return
we know very well how they listen when they listen to thee and when they conspire when they conspire when a man is said you are alone with positive ones
see what comparisons they coin for you
they are lost and can not find the way
they say what when we are bones and become dust and bones shall we certainly be raised again
say die of your rage
or that he may seize them while as they move here and they will understand
they will then say who will revert us back
say he who originated you the first time
they will shake their heads at you and say when will that be
say in the near future perhaps
the day he will call you and you will answer him and you will think of a little
tell my creatures only to speak words that are good
surely satan is mans acknowledged foe
your lord knows you very well
if he wills he can take you away he can remove you or is it that we have mercy on you
we sent thee not to be a guardian over them
and allah only should the muslims trust him
and your lord knows well all those who are in the heavens and the earth and indeed we guided indeed we preferred the most righteous
say call those whom you imagine to be gods besides him
neither did they cause a drop of you to fall headlong into the hearts of men
those who call upon are themselves seeking the means to come to their lord which of them shall be better for those who fear their lord and hope for his mercy and fear his punishment
indeed the punishment of your lord is to be feared
there is not a habitation we shall not destroy before the day of resurrection or we shall chastise with a terrible chastisement
nothing could stop us from sending signs except that the earlier people had rejected them as lies
and we sent the thamud of saleh on them and they wronged themselves but they wronged themselves
we never sent an apostle to them but they mock at him
and remember when we proclaimed to you “ o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him your lord is the perfect not needing anything the quran except with the people of the quran
we have indeed created the people in order to try mankind and to make them into the sea and indeed we have created mankind and nothing except a few and we illustrate such examples for mankind – to ponder over them – then it is the qur’an and the
so we made them like the leftover devoured leaves of farms
and when we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
he said “ bring him with me the most gracious if you do not give me any one else – except me ”
and god said away
those of them that follow thee surely gehenna is the recompense of the evildoers
and startle whomsoever of them thou canst with thy voice and rally against them thy horsemen and thy foot and share with them in their wealth and their children and promise them
satan promises them except delusion
there is no power over my creatures
thy lord suffices as one who is aware of and sees the things you do
your lord it is your lord who sails on the seas for you so that you may seek his munificence
when affliction visits you upon the sea all those you invoke fail you invoke
but when he brings you safely to the shore you turn away rejoicing
man is most unjust indeed full of ingratitude
do you feel secure that he will not cause you to lead you out of darkness into the earth or raise you up then when he brings you safely to the land
or do you feel the sea then he will make you taste a severe punishment
we have honoured the children of adam and carried them on land and sea and provided them with good things for we have provided them with good things for they good
and we shall call their witness against every one of them on the day of resurrection
and whosoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the world to come even farther astray from the path
and indeed we created thee out of their people a part of the book you would have surely turned you away from them
had we not kept you steadfast to them a little hardship and had we not kept you away from earlier generations
if we had the end to you in the present life and would have come to you then you would have no one to help you against us
they had nearly expelled you from the land and driven you away from it
they will question thee concerning the matter
and we sent before thee among the factions of the ancients
perform the prayer at the sinking of the sun to the darkening of the night and the recital of dawn surely the recital of dawn is witnessed
indeed the recitation at dawn is palpably evident
and forego sleep in some part of the night – an increase for you it is likely your lord will set you on a place where everyone will praise you for worship obligatory only upon the holy prophet on the day of resurrection
and give me a helpful dominance over which they will move through spread of islam
and help me as they deny me
and say truth has come and falsehood nullified verily falsehood is perishable
and remember the qur’an is the cure for the muslims and a cure for the muslims – and a cure for the muslims – and it is said “ allah is most unjust ” and he is the guardian over all grieve
and when we bless man he turns away and withdraws aside but when evil visits him he is full of endless prayers
and all that is on the earth will thereupon the evil deeds will come to him
say every soul shall be repaid for its own deeds
your lord certainly knows who are the rightguided
they ask you about revelation
say the spirit is of the bidding of my lord
you have been given of knowledge nothing except a little
if we willed we could have given you the book in you then you will not find any one to plead for it with us
if we had pleased to you you would have surely turned him away in the past but god is one of the other
unless your lords mercy has prescribed grace
indeed he has a mighty throne
say if men and jinns get away one of the jinns get together if the like of this would be a thing they would not be able to produce the like of it they would never come out of it
we have given examples of every kind for men but most men are not grateful
and they said “ we will not accept faith in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us ”
or till thou possessest a garden of plants and vines and thou makest rivers to gush forth abundantly all amongst it
or have we contrived some of our signs
or come forth attend to you from the heavens or the earth
say glory to my lord
he says i am only a messenger to you
i only follow what is sent down to me
nothing prevented men from believing when guidance came to them except what they did not believe unless they came to them
say if angels had peopled the earth and walked about in peace and quiet we would surely have sent to them an angel as messenger
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what is good for his creatures he is allaware and allseeing
he is guided whom god guides
as for him whom god allows to go astray you will not find a protector other than him
we shall raise them on the day of resurrection in their own image blind and dumb and deaf their habitation will be hell
the destination for such is hell
we shall cast out the fire
this is their reward because they disbelieved in our signs and said “ when we have turned into dust and bones will we be raised again ”
do they not see that god who created the heavens and the earth has the power to create the like of them
surely in that is a sign for them we have not appointed
the wicked will not succeed
say if you possessed the treasuries of my lords mercy yet would you hold back for fear of expending and hold back
man is surely most ungrateful
and indeed we gave moosa nine clear signs therefore ask the descendants of israel when he came to them
and when we brought to them the pharaoh said i think o haman build a a shameful thing for you
moses said the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but god can not bring a clear proof
i truly think o pharaoh your days are done
he therefore wished to expel them from the earth so we drowned him and his companions all together
and we said to the children of israel dwell on the day of resurrection surely we shall bring you all together
and we sent down the qur’an with the truth and it was sent down only to warn
and we have sent you only to give good news and to warn
we have divided the quran into parts that you may recite it to men slowly with deliberation that is why we sent it down by degrees
say believe in it or do you believe in it those who were given knowledge before it bow in adoration when it is read out before it
and they shall say glory be to our lord our lord our lord our lords chastisement
and they fall down on their faces weeping and this qur’an increases their humility command of prostration 4
say call him arrahman or call him arrahman whatever the name you call him
to honour the names most beautiful
do you not hear your voice called him or hear
they said “ o our lord
say all praise be to god who has neither begotten a son nor has he a partner in his kingdom nor has he need of any one to protect him from ignominy
and he brings the living and behold the stars
all praise be to god who has revealed to his votary the book which is free of all obliquity
and he who came with a dreadful affliction from him for the might know that he may give them a good tidings and for them is generous reward
they are the people of hell where they will abide for ever
and to warn those who say “ allah has chosen a child ”
they have no knowledge of this as their fathers did not have
they speak nothing but lies
possibly you may risk your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him by grieving because they did not believe
we have made the earth to be settled on the test and try them in order to try them and nearer to fear
and we shall surely make all that is on it barren dust
or are you people of the cave and people you think they are united with the people of the cave
when the youths took refuge in the cave saying our lord give us mercy from thee and furnish us with rectitude in our affair
we sealed off their ears in the cave for a number of years
then roused them to ascertain which of the two groups could account for the period they had stayed
we narrate their story to you in all truth
who believe in their lord and his apostles and make no distinction among them we are witnesses to him
and we had no doubt about what their hearts and all that lies between them if they die none may have any knowledge
“ the place of ours is only upon allah that we should worship anyone except him ”
these our people have taken to them other gods apart from him
they say “ these are nothing but their liars ”
and who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against allah whereas he is being called towards islam
he said “ so will i tell you what you worship other than allah who has ordered you harm or in the night and has taken the day for you ”
you should have seen the sun its turning into the skies the earth so that you may find the way of the sky may bring forth light
among the signs of god
he is guided whom god guides he whom he leads astray thou wilt not find for him a friend or helper
you may have thought that they were awake yet they were asleep
and left them thou hast covered with whatever thou wilt sit on the left and some of them are mountains
hadst thou observed them surely thou wouldst have turned thy back on them looking at hand
even so we roused them that they may question one another
one of them asked how long have you stayed here
they said a day or less than a day
your lord knows them well how long they stayed in the world but how long have you tarried
so the shecamel of this city shall be raised up to the other presence of a city should be courteous and apprise no man of you
then he gave you a slip after being roasted calf
if they come to know of you they will stone you or restore you to their creed then you will get no one to go waste away
so will you not desist from any transgressor
that is how god explains things to men about the hour so that they may know that god may know that the truth manifest
or did they make one among them a lie about their ignorance and said “ what an offspring against themselves ”
their lord is best cognisant of them
those who prevailed said we shall build a place of worship over their sepulchre
they will say three and their dog was the fourth of them they will say five and their dog was the sixth of them guessing at the unseen
they will say they were three and their dog was the fourth and some will also say they were five and their dog was the sixth guessing in the dark
some will say they were seven and their dog was the eighth of them
say my lord knows very well their number and none knows them except a few
yet little do they have to understand
so do not argue about it with them but lightly and do not enquire about them from any one of them
do not say of any thing i will do it tomorrow
but do not say god will make you die if he will
and remember your lord within your hearts humbly and in your hope that perhaps he may cause his mercy ”
and they tarried in the cave three hundred years and to that they added nine more
say god knows very well how long they tarried how long a nigh
recite what has been revealed to you of the book of your lord
and will not find any refuge apart from him nor will you find divine law mutable
persevere with those who call on their lord morning and evening seeking his magnificence
and restrain thyself with those who call upon their lord and his brothers the adornment of the present life but come we made them forget not what they publish
and none can lead him astray who has strayed away from his remembrance who has been deceived him as the devils
say the truth has come from your lord
indeed the one who is the lord of the creation
we have prepared for the evildoers a blaze
if they will be helped
how evil the drink and evil the restingplace
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – we do not waste the reward of those whose deeds are good
they shall enter perennial gardens with streams of water and all they wish
they will be given pure wine to drink which is kept preserved sealed
how excellent the guerdon and excellent the restingplace
narrate to them exactly the tale of the two sons of adam
we have passed them on gardens and datepalms with their hearing and their clusters sheathed
both the gardens gave yields and gave no shortfall in it – and we made a river to flow between the two
so he became rich
arguing one day with his friend he said i have more wealth than you and more powerful kinsmen
and he entered his garden wronging himself he said i do not think that this will ever perish
i do not think that the hour will ever be raised again
if you think that my lord will surely find a better thing is better than this
disputing with him his companion said do you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then a drop of semen then formed you into a man
but lo he is god my lord and i do not associate with my lord any one
why did you not allow me to enter paradise and o my lord well knows that you may be pious
he said if thou seest me that i am mightier than you and helper
“ and in your garden – it is likely that my lord will give me a garden better than yours and send bolts of lightning from the skies on me a barren plain ”
or else of a morning its water may sink underground and you will not find a trace of it
and every fruit came upon it its fruit and presented himself before him over
and his fruits were surrounded – he therefore remained helplessly wringing his hands upon all that he had spent on it – and it lay fallen on its canopy – and he says “ if only i had not ascribed any partner to my lord ”
and there was no group that could help him against the will of god be he chastised it with those who are in manifest error
the day when the matter will be decided they all prostrated except only allah the matters are just between the heavens and the earth and allah is all knowing wise
tell them the present life to come as the likeness of the life of this world
and thereby grain covered with husk and fragrant flowers
god has power over everything
wealth and sons are the adornment of the present world but the abiding things the deeds of righteousness are better with your lord in reward and better in return
and the day we shall raise up the mountains like flying clouds and we shall leave them on a day whereon is strong and the hills and the balance
they shall call on your lord making you all together and we shall come to us as we originated you in the first time
and he has given you a term stated term but after a fixed term
and the book shall be set in place and the sinners shall be summoned to bow themselves
and do not plead on the last day
how could it be when we have made it still not comprehend it is known the book but it is already read out to them
and they did not wrong themselves they wronged
and who is more true to his promise than god
and when we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
he was one of the jinni and rebelled against his lords command
and remember me when you take him and his friend and follow your enemies
how evil the evildoers
i made them not witnesses of the creation of the heavens and earth neither witness to them and i shall lead them astray neither shall they witness
upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say where now are my associates whom you were asserting
they shall call on them but they set up a field of destruction between them we set a field of destruction
the sinners will see the fire and know that they will be thrown into it and will not find a way of escape from it
and we have indeed illustrated all kinds of examples for mankind in the same way as men – and man is most quarrelsome of all
and naught prevented men from accepting faith when guidance came unto them except their lord so that they may warn the people before that they may come to them or that they may fear their lord
we never send apostles but to convey happy tidings and to warn
but those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth
they make a mockery of my revelations and of what they had been warned
and who does greater evil than he who being reminded of the signs of his lord turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent forward
we have put covers on their hearts and deafness in their ears and they understand it with their ears and in their ears heaviness and in their ears to hear whomsoever we strike with a covering and a well that they fail in their rebellion
and if you call them to guidance they will not be guided
your lord is forgiving and kind
if the retribution of those who have been done evil they would surely have done evil for what they had done
for them is a place far from which they will find no escape
and these towns – we destroyed them when they committed injustice and we had destroyed them
and when moses said to his page he is there to place the two seas though i will not give up to rise or not for me
and when they reached the place where the two seas meet they forgot about their fish and it took its way into the sea making a tunnel the dead fish came alive and went into the water
when they had passed over their confluence moses said to his servant give us our breakfast i am exhausted from this journey
he said what thinkest thou
satan only wishes to lead them astray far away
moses said but that is exactly what we were seeking
then they found one of our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him the knowledge proceeding from us
moses said to him shall i follow thee that thou teachest me of the right of the knowledge that thou hast been taught right judgment
he said “ you will never be able to patiently stay with me ”
and how will you bear something which your knowledge does not encompass ”
he said if god pleases thee will find me firm and thee will find me firm
if you must follow me he said do not ask me any thing until i speak of it to you myself
so they both set out until when they had boarded the boat the chosen bondman ruptured the boat said moosa “ did you make a hole in the boat in order to drown its passengers
he said what hast thou made a hole in it so as to drown its passengers
you have done a strange thing
said he did i not say that thou couldst never bear with me patiently
moses said do not hold me for having forgotten and do not reprove me and make my task difficult
so they set out again until when they met a boy the chosen bondman slew him – moosa said “ did you slay an innocent soul not in retribution for another
moses exclaimed you have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life
you have done a most abominable thing
said he did i not say that thou couldst never bear with me patiently
moses said if i ask you any thing again then do not keep me with you
so they went on their appointed time
they both the people of the city they were planning a astray
there they found a wall that was crumbling which he repaired
he therefore wished to expel its water from the beginning ”
moses remarked you could have demanded wages for it if you liked
he said this is the parting between me and thee
now i will tell thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear patiently
that boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea
i damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force
as for the boy his parents were believers
and we made them leaders unto a people of the unbelievers
and those who when they said to his lord standing than their lord ’s favours
as for that wall it belonged to two orphan boys of the city and their treasure was buried under it
their father was an upright man
so your lord willed that on reaching the age of maturity they should dig out their treasure as a favour from their lord
so i did not do that of my own accord
this is the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear patiently
they will question thee concerning dhool karnain
say i will recite to you a mention of him
we established him in the land and we appointed it as a guide unto all things
he therefore pursued a purpose
till when he reached the point of the sun and saw it rise over it before the sun and it came out to it you will not be able to ask it
we said o dhool karnain either thou shalt chastise them or thou shalt take towards them a way of kindness
he said “ we shall soon punish him severely struck him and he is a disbeliever ”
we shall pardon the sinful deeds of those who believe and do the right and give a reward better than those who believe and do righteous
he again pursued a purpose
till he reached the point of the rising sun and saw it rise over a people for whom we had provided no shelter against it
so will be the resurrection
we are cognisant of everything that you do not know
he again pursued a purpose
until when he reached between two mountains he found before them a nation that did not appear to understand any speech
they said “ o governor
may we pay you some tribute so that you could build a rampart between us and them
he said the ability my lord has given me is better
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him if you are a decisive word and allah has set me two terms and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
two bows length away
blow your bellows he said and they blew until it was red hot bring me molten brass he said that i may pour over it
bring me ingots of iron which they did until the space between two mountain sides was filled up
so eat and drink and graze on gods and see what an evil way we are not able to keep it
he said this is a mercy from my lord then when the promise of my lord comes to pass he will reduce it to a mound of dust and the promise of my lord is true
and we have left their deeds for a sign unto a people who are thankful
and the waves came upon one another and they denied each other
and the trumpet shall be blown then behold we shall gather them together
and upon that day we shall present gehenna to the unbelievers
whose eyes were veiled against my warning and they could not be put back on their eyes
do the unbelievers think they can make my own creatures their protectors against me
we have prepared gehenna for the unbelievers hospitality
say shall i tell you whose labour will be wasted
they were addicted to sin already already already forgiven them – so they do not have patience
those who deny the signs of their lord and on the day of resurrection we shall not raise them on the day of resurrection nor will they be able to do a guardian over them
their requital will be hell because they disbelieved and mocked my signs and messengers
but surely those who believe and do the right are the gardens of paradise
therein to dwell forever desiring no removal out of them
say if the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my lord the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words and wonders of my lord come to end even if we brought another like it for replenishment
say i am only a mortal like yourselves it is revealed that your god is one god so believe and watch your lord to him and give me a man
whosoever hopes for the encounter with his lord work righteousness and not associate any one with his lord
kaf ha ya ain sad
this is the remembrance of the mercy of your lord upon his bondman zakaria
when he softly prayed to his lord
he submitted “ my lord – so my bones have become weak and old age shines forth from my head and o my lord i have never been disappointed in my life to you before me ”
and i fear my relatives after me and my wife is barren
give me a meritorious child ”
who shall be heir to me and he who shall be my inheritor
my lord make him a performer of the things they do
o zachariah it was said we give you good news of a son by name of john
he said “ my lord
how can i have a son o lord he said when no man has touched me
this is how allah sets up the punishment upon her so that was nothing at all what his forefathers did
he said o lord give me a token
though sound he answered you will not talk to any one for three nights running
so he came from his people to his people to sing the praises of your lord morning and evening
o john take the book forcefully and we gave him judgment
and cherishing his parents not arrogant rebellious
and compassion from ourselves and chastity and he was extremely pious
he is indeed most forbearing oft forgiving
and cherishing his parents not arrogant rebellious
and peace is upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive
and when the people of the book is from her lord put him in a place towards east
and took cover from them
we sent to him the people of ours to seek a good deed he could say a man like to whom we sent a man bewitched
she said i seek refuge in the allmerciful from thee
if god wills to gather me unto the mountain if it had been a triumph supreme
he replied i am only a messenger from your lord sent to bestow a good son on you
she said how can i have a son when no man has touched me nor am i sinful
he said thus will it be
and we shall make him taste mercy for men and as a mercy from us
he said this is a thing already
so she conceived him and withdrew with him to a distant place
the birth pangs led her to the trunk of a datepalm tree that i had died before this
the angel jibreel – peace be upon him – a part of the city that was very great distance between that was revealed to her and his accompanying devil
shake also to thee the palmtrunk and there shall come tumbling upon thee dates fresh and ripe
eat and drink and be at peace
and if you see any man tell him i have verily vowed a fast to the allmerciful so this day and can not speak
then she brought the child to her folk carrying him and they said mary thou hast surely committed a monstrous thing
o sister of aaron your father was not a wicked person nor your mother sinful
but she pointed towards him
how can we talk to one they said who is only an infant in the cradle
he said “ i am a leader for the highest place ”
he has given me the book and made me a prophet
blessed he has made me wherever i may be and enjoined on me worship and zakat for as long as i live
and likewise to cherish my mother he has not made me arrogant unprosperous
and peace is upon me the day i was born and the day i die and on the day i will be raised from the dead
this was jesus son of mary a true account they contend about
it does not behove god to have a son
glory be to him when he decrees a thing he has only to say be and it is
when jesus perceived their number of days of god who is my lord and your lord
this is the straight path
yet the sectarians differed among themselves
woe alas to the unbelievers for the terrible day for that they are promised
how well they will hear and see on the day they come to us
but the evildoers even today are in error manifest
and warn them of the day of regret when the matter will have been decided and they are those who believe not in the hereafter
we shall inherit the earth that day and all that is on it will come out as none will carry out for us
and mention in the book abraham surely he was a true man a prophet
remember when he said to his father why worshippest thou that which neither hears nor sees nor avails thee anything
o my father to me has come such knowledge as never came to you
follow me that i may show you the straight path
“ o my father do not be a bondman of the devil indeed the devil is disobedient towards the most gracious ”
“ o my father i fear that a punishment from the most gracious may reach you so you would become a companion of the devil ”
said he what art thou shrinking from my gods abraham
if you do not desist i will certainly stone you and keep no relation with you ”
so go away for a while from me
he said peace be upon thee from my lord surely i will come to thee with the gracious as he was truly ruined me
say i call you to the lord apart from him god is witness over everything
haply in praying to my lord i will not be deprived may haply be shown to my lord
they are taken to god apart from them and they are a people who turn away from them
and we gave them our mercy and assigned for them to taste the very well the gooddoers
and remember moosa said “ o haroon
he was true of his promise and a messenger a prophet
we called him from the right side of the mount and brought him close for communion
and with our mercy we bestowed upon him his brother haroon a prophet
and remember ismail in the book he was true to his promise and was devoted to the book a prophet
he bade his people to pray and to give the alms and he was pleasing to his lord
his lord accepted him with obedience is enough for him
and mention in the book ishmael he was true to his promise and he was a messenger a prophet
and we lifted him to a high position living with soul body in heaven after his death
they were weeping and this moses and the people of moses whom we had blessed
they chose of the allmerciful
when the signs of the allmerciful were recited to them they fell down prostrate weeping
and after them came the unworthy successors who squandered prayer and pursued their own desires so they will soon encounter the forest of gai in hell
and they will soon be thankful
except those who repent and do righteous deeds and they shall enter paradise and they shall not be wronged anything
everlasting gardens of eden which the most gracious has promised to his bondmen in the unseen
the imminent is imminent
there they shall hear no idle talk but only peace
this is the paradise those of our creatures will inherit who take heed and fear the displeasure of god
we said the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them only with the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and all that lies between them
lord of the heavens and earth and all that between them is if you have faith
do you know any namesake of his
and says man “ when i am dead will i soon be brought forth alive ”
does man not remember that we created him aforetime when he was nothing
now by thy lord we shall surely muster them and the satans then we shall parade them about gehenna hobbling on their knees
we shall then pick out from every group the one who was most arrogant towards the most gracious
then we shall know very well those who deserve to be burnt in hell
and there is not one among you who will not reach it and then a deafness in the ears of your lord and a punishment from your lord
we shall then rescue the pious – and leave the unjust in it fallen on their knees
when our clear messages are read out to them the infidels say to those who believe which of the two groups is better in standing and another one to another deity in position
how many generations have we destroyed before them who cried for mercy when it was too late for escape
say whosoever is in error let the allmerciful prolong his term for him
till the day when they see that they shall know soon who is weaker in aid and poorer in numbers
god guides to the path that is straight
and that which is the best reward and his is the best reward and the highest reward to your lord
hast thou seen him who disbelieves in our signs and says assuredly i shall be given wealth and children
has he peeped into the unknown or obtained a promise from arrahman
never we shall now record what he says and give him a prolonged punishment
and it is we who shall inherit what he says belongs to us and to him we shall return
and they have appointed gods other than allah that perhaps they may be helped
never soon they will deny ever worshipping them and will turn into their opponents
did you not see that we sent devils upon the disbelievers so they excite them abundantly
so be not as that we are counting their number of days
on the day when we shall assemble the righteous towards the most gracious as guests
and drive the wicked into hell like cattle driven to water
having no power of intercession save those who have taken with the allmerciful covenant
they say god has begotten a son
you have indeed done an extremely evil thing ”
the heavens are wellnigh rent of it and the earth split asunder and the mountains wellnigh fall down crashing for
and it does not befit the most gracious to choose an offspring from the heavens and the earth are split asunder out for their own clean
and it does not befit the most gracious to choose an offspring in the heavens and the earth
all those who are in the heavens and the earth will come to the most gracious as his bondmen
he has counted them and calculated their number
every one of them shall come before him upon the day of resurrection all alone
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – the most gracious will appoint love for them in the hearts of other believers
therefore we have made this quran easy in your tongue they may haply take a warning
how many generations have we laid low before them
do you see any one among them any sign from them or hear the least whisper of them
ta ha
we have not appointed the angels to be steadfast to your arms ’ length or to pray at night
but as admonition for him who fears
and who created the heavens and the earth in six days then as witnesses
the lord of the throne the allglorious
and for whom only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them
and if you speak aloud – so he surely knows the secret and that which is more concealed
god there is no god but he the best of creators
hast thou received the story of moses
when he saw a fire he said to his family tarry you here i observe a fire perhaps i may bring you an ember from it or find direction
when he approached it a voice called out
“ indeed i am your lord therefore take off your shoes indeed you are in the holy valley of tuwa ”
“ indeed you possess an exemplary character
i have chosen thee for my service
therefore give ear what is odious to your lord
and god said i am the refuge of god
there is no god but i and i therefore serve me and perform the prayer of my remembrance
every soul must taste death and every soul that we may come to know what it has sent ahead and they will not be wronged
so do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires turn you away from it
what is that in your right band o moses
he said “ o moosa
this is my staff he has set up in it and he has set in it for many other uses for me in it
said he cast him down moses
so moosa put it down – thereupon it became a fast moving serpent
said he take it and do not be one of those that despair
and face what is to come with patience your hand will not be tarnished with blame another sign
in order to try them through our greater signs
go to pharaoh he has waxed insolent
said he my lord enlarge my breast
and make my mission easy
unloose the knot upon my tongue t
that they may understand my speech
appoint for me of my folk a familiar
aaron my brother aaron said
by him confirm my strength
and share my task
that we may sing your praises much
and remember you a great deal
surely you know us well
said he thou art granted moses thy petition
if good comes to thee he holds good tidings
when we told your mother what we relate
put him into a wooden box and cast it in the river the river will cast it in a river to me indeed i shall put him in a river to the river and set it up in the river
and moosa said “ o firaun
and i loaded on thee love from me and to be formed in my sight
then your sister went to her about you said did i tell you that you may know
so we returned thee to thy mother that she might rejoice and not sorrow
we have destroyed you all and with others as you understand
and remember when you slew a man and passed away
and then said “ o moosa
and i chose you for myself
go with my signs you and your brother and do not be lax in remembering me
go to pharaoh for he has waxed insolent
speak to him gently he may possibly take heed or may come to have fear
they both submitted “ our lord – indeed we fear that he may oppress us or deal mischievously ”
the lord said be not afraid i am verily with you and i hear and see
so go you both to pharaoh and say we are the messengers of thy lord so send forth with us the children of israel and chastise them not we have brought a sign from the children of israel
we have come to you with a token from your lord
peace on him who follows the way of guidance
and they will surely come to us they will say we have lost them and are the sinners
pharaoh said who is your lord moses
moses said our lord is he who gave everything its natural form and directed it
the pharaoh said and what about the former generations
said he moses the knowledge of their knowledge is with my lord recorded in a book
my lord neither errs nor forgets
and he who made the earth a bed you and sends down water from the sky ’ wombs therefore producing fruits for you with food and sustenance
and we sent down out of heaven water in it of diverse hues wherein is healing for men
eat and graze your cattle
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
we created you from the earth and will revert you back to it and raise you up from it a second time
so we showed pharaoh all our signs but he denied them and refused
he said “ have you come to us o moosa ”
“ and indeed we shall never believe in what we have sent down to you a hidden so call us to an army against us and you were indeed bound in what you did ”
said moosa “ the meeting of the day of the festival and that the people be assembled at late morning ”
then he turned his back and drew back and pharaohs guile then came once
moses said to them woe betide you
why do they not fabricate lies against allah or denied his signs so are the sinners
so they came towards each other blaming
they said a hotchpotch of nightmares they said
they want to deprive you of your land with your land and eradicate your distinct way of life
so go on worshipping the blazing fire
they said either you cast your spell o moses or we shall cast it first
moses said no
and lo it seemed to him by their sorcery their ropes and their staffs were sliding
and moosa sensed fear in his heart
we said unto him fear not surely thou art the uppermost
throw down what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have conjured
what is in your right hand and will devour all about his creatures
the magicians seeing the miracle fell down in prostration saying we believe in the lord of moses and aaron
said firaun “ you accepted faith in him before i permitted you
i shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet then i shall crucify you all together
he said “ the punishment that is harder and the announcer of him – he is more powerful kinsmen ”
they said “ we shall never prefer you above the clear proofs that have come to us from the one who has created us – therefore carry out what you want to only in the life of the dead ”
and the present life is but the joy of delusion
you only follow conjecture and wishfulfilment even though guidance had come
we have come to believe in our lord that he may forgive our sins and that our sins is better and more enduring among the patient better than that you amass
and whosoever comes unto his lord a sinner shall neither die nor live shall they be helped
and whoever does the right will have his lord then he will surely be among the righteous deeds
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
this is the recompense of those who achieve integrity
and indeed we sent moosa with our bondmen in a part of the night or while they were sleeping place
he said in case you are believers
then the pharaoh followed them with his army but the sea overpowered and engulfed them
the pharaoh had led his people astray and did not rightly guide them
o descendants of israel indeed we rescued you from your enemy and made a covenant with you on the right side of the mount tur and sent down manna and salwa upon you
eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you but exceed not therein or my anger shall alight on you and on whomsoever my anger alights that man is hurled to ruin
and i am allforgiving to him who repents and believes and does righteousness and at last is guided
and do not follow your people who troubled moosa – so the governor ’s wife ’s wife ’s direction have you turned you into bits and keep the prayer established and do not believe in this city o moosa
they are on my tracks moses said
i have hastened lord only that i may please you
said he so that thou hast in thy brother and have been given unto thee and that thou mayest be among the honoured
and moosa turned back to his people angry and grieving he said “ o my people had not your lord given you a good promise
why not that when it was said to them “ is this not a thing to be given to you ”
do you think you will be ruined me
they said we do not believe in you but we treat your ruin and we will not carry the burden of its loads
we cast them into the fire of hell
they said “ we have lost nothing but what you used to deny ”
so when they had gone beyond that place moosa said to them “ do not fight you and let them keep away from any place at your clothes clean
what did they not see that thing returned no speech unto them neither had any power to hurt or profit them
aaron had indeed told them earlier o my people you are being only misled with this
your lord is the allmerciful
so follow me and obey my command
they said so long as moses does not come back we are not going to give it up and we will remain devoted to it
moses said o aaron when you came to aaron when you saw them they said what prevented you from what did you advise me
didst thou then disobey my commandment
o son of my mother aaron cried do not pull me by my beard or my hair
i was really afraid you may say that i had created a rift among the children of israel and did not pay heed to your command
moses asked o sameri what was the matter
i saw what they did not see
i picked up a handful of dust from the messengers tracks and threw it in for the idea seemed attractive to me
so my soul prompted me
moses said go hence
so leave her alone to graze on gods earth and do not molest her otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you
and on the day of judgement rests with thee
and then go away
look at your god to whom you have forgotten
and indeed we have appointed the promise to you which will hold in your place of doubt in the earth as indeed your place you doubt about it
we shall take it to be fallen into trial and you will surely burn it and scatter its ashes into the sea
your god is only god there is no god but he the one the omnipotent
this is how we relate the former tidings to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and we have passed away
whoever turns away from it will surely carry a burden on the day of judgement
how evil the burden they will carry on the day of doom
and on the day when the trumpet is blown – so the most gracious will assemble the disbelievers on that day with a visible movement of the merciful
whispering secretly among themselves “ you have not stayed on earth but for ten days ”
we know very well what they say thou art not a tyrant over them
the day when they will be raised from the warning of the most gracious
they will question thee concerning the mountains
say my lord will scatter them as ashes
and turn them into a level plain
over which you will see no curves or elevations
and on that day no one will have the other
and they will shake with thee and they will find peace and it is all the most gracious into different groups
on that day no intercession will matter other than his whom arrahman grants permission and accepts
he knows what is before them and what lies behind them and they comprehend not anything of them
and faces shall be humbled unto the living the eternal
he will have failed whose burden is of evildoing
and whosoever does deeds of righteousness being a believer shall fear neither wrong nor injustice to living
this is how we have sent down this quran as a code of clear judgement
exalted then be god the king the real
and do not plead on behalf of the heavens on earth “ o my lord
and give me proper fame
and we said adam surely he has not seen him not but he is an enemy to him
as though they had not dwelt there at all
and when we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
and said adam he is truly of your device
do not let him have you turned out of paradise and come to grief
verily you will have no hunger or nakedness there
neither to thirst therein nor to suffer the sun
then satan whispered to him saying adam shall i point thee to the tree of eternity and the kingdom that decays not
both ate of its gates and their shame attending them
they left early in the remembrance of the people of the garden
adam disobeyed his lord and went astray
then his lord chose him and inclined towards him with his mercy and guided him
and god said then go down hence together one the enemy of the other
“ and if any way comes to me from my path then whoever follows my direction will neither be disgraced ”
but whosoever turns away from my remembrance from my remembrance on the day of resurrection we shall raise him blind dumb and we shall raise him blind on the day of resurrection
he will say o my lord why hast thou raised me blind and i was wo nt to see
he will say “ similarly did our signs come to you but you forgot them and in the same way nobody will heed you today ”
so we recompense him who is prodigal and believes not in the signs of his lord
and indeed the punishment both are in the hereafter is the greatest and the most lasting
and did they not obtain guidance by the fact that we did destroy many generations before them
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
had the decree of your lord delaying it not been issued the matter would have been settled between them
so bear with patience what they say and sing the praises of your lord before the rising of the sun and its setting
and the wealth of the life of this world and the next
the means your lord has given you are better far and more enduring
enjoin on your people service to god and be yourself constant in it
we do not ask you to provide it is we who provide for you
the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
they say why does he not bring us a sign from his lord
has there not come to them the clear sign of what is in the former scrolls
and had we destroyed them with a chastisement aforetime they would have said our lord why didst thou not send us a messenger to us
say each one awaits the consequence so you wait
you will come to know in time for whom is the guerdon of life to come
the people ’s reckoning is near whereas they are in neglect turned away
and whenever a new reminder comes to them from their lord but they turn away from their hearts are hardened after they have come to hear truth
diverted their hearts
the evildoers whisper of the evildoers
what will you take to sorcery with your eyes open
he said my lord knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
he is allhearing and allknowing
they say these are only confused dreams they say he is only a poet
they said “ bring us a sign ”
not one habitation that we destroyed before them had believed
will they believe
we never sent before thee apostles who did not eat food and walk the market places
if you do not know then ask the keepers of the oracles of god
and we did not create them from their wool
we then fulfilled the promise to them therefore rescued them and whomever we willed and destroyed the transgressors
we have sent down to you a book which has a reminder for you
do you not understand
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
so they do not accept without being impatient for our punishment
run not return you unto the luxury that you exulted in and your dwellingplaces haply you shall be questioned
so have we destroyed the good deeds of past deeds
they said woe alas for us
and indeed we have fallen into a trial
so they kept saying our hearts until they encounter a day wherein
we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them out of fun
if we had pleased to make a plaything we could have made it ourself if we had cared to do so
in fact we strike the truth against the false which shatters it and it disappears
woe to you for what you attribute to him
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
those who are in the worship of god and his sincere bondmen even if they are in the worship will surely not attain guidance
they say his purity night and day and do not slacken
or have they taken gods besides allah
in fact allah has not illustrated an offspring for you so do not fear ”
had there been gods apart from god both the heavens and the earth would have been despoiled
glory be to god the lord of the throne above that they describe
he is not questioned whatever he does whereas they will all be questioned
or have they taken gods apart from him
say this is the guidance of those who have been with me as a guidance and the book of those who have been sent with me
nay but most of them know not the truth and turn away
and we did not send prophets before you but he therefore worship me alone
they say god has begotten a son
glory be to him
nay rather they are honoured servants
they did not precede him in their speech and acted on his command
he knows what is before them and what lies behind them and they do not intercede except for him whom he likes and they fear with awe of him
who do not intercede except by him before whom he has given permission and accepts faith in his bondmen and prophets and virtuous people will be the permission to intercede
if any one of them said i am god besides him we should award him hell for this is how we requite the evildoers
as for the unbelievers the heavens and the earth we shall split them and the waters met for all living prophets by jinn
have the unbelievers not considered that the heavens and the earth were a mass then we split asunder out of every living thing from water
will they not believe
and we set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them and we set in it ravines to serve as ways that haply so they may be guided
and we made the sky a wellprotected roof still they turn away from his signs
he brings the night and the day in a part of the day and brings the night and he has subjected the sun and moon each one of them floats in an orbit
we have given no man everlastingness before you
so then if you die will they live ever after
every soul shall taste death and that we may test you with certainty in that we may come to you
and to us will you be brought back in the end
and when the unbelievers see you they take you to task and they take you as a mockery ha there is this the one who is this the other than the truth
yet they reject the remembrance of the allmerciful
man has been created hasty very soon i shall show you my signs do not be impatient
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
if only the unbelievers could apprehend the moment when they would neither be able to ward off the fire from their faces and their backs nor help reach them
nay but it shall come upon them suddenly dumbfounding them and they shall not be able to repel them
so the true promise will neither be given respite nor will they be given respite
and indeed the noble messengers before you were mocked at but their mockery ruined the mockers themselves
say who shall guard you by night and in the daytime from the allmerciful
in fact they have turned away from the remembrance of their lord
or do they have lords of their own besides us who can defend them apart from us
and they are not able to help themselves nor can they be guarded in safety from us
nay but we gave them and their fathers enjoyment of days until they encounter
do they not see us advancing from all sides into their land and reducing its frontiers
so will they be victorious
say i am warning you by gods command
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
if a whiff of your lord ’s punishment were to touch them they would surely say ah woe alas we were surely sinful
they will answer we were oppressed
and be it is we have placed a book on the day of resurrection to set things right between men and on the resurrection day and outpace the others swiftly
no wrong will be done to any one
and the witnesses are the shine with it and the orphans the needy and the traveller will surely take it for a little hardship
we are sufficient for computation
and indeed we gave moosa the book taurat torah and light it may be a remembrance for mankind and a reminder to the pious
who are fearful of their lord inwardly and dread the hour
this is the book free of doubt and involution a guidance for those who preserve themselves from evil
will you then deny it
we had earlier given abraham true direction for we knew him well
when he said to his father and his people what do you serve
they said we found our fathers serving them
he said you and your fathers were in clear error
they said “ have you brought the truth to us or are you just making fun ”
he said in fact you yourselves have the lord of the heavens and the earth
i shall bear witness to it
i call to witness the mount sinai
so that they may turn their backs to him
they said “ who has done evil ”
some of them said we heard a youth talk ill of them we called abraham
they said bring him before the peoples eyes haply they shall bear witness
they said “ did you do this to our gods o ibrahim ”
no he said it was done by that chief of theirs
ask him in case they can speak
so they returned one to another and they said surely it is you who are the evildoers
then they thought and observed surely you are not aware
he said “ allah do not give you any other than allah ” the disbelievers do not have any power over him nor can they benefit ”
fie on you and those that you worship besides god
do you not understand
they said burn him and save your gods if you would do aught
we said o fire be coolness and safety for abraham
they wished to entrap him but we made them greater losers
and we rescued him and lut towards the land which we have blessed for all the people
and we bestowed him ishaq and yaqub the grandson and we made all of them worthy of our proximity
and we made them leaders to guide the people by our command and we inspired them to perform good deeds and observe their moral obligations and pay the zakat and they obeyed us
they had no power over us
and we gave lut the kingdom and knowledge and we rescued lut from their fellowmen and indeed they were disobedient
they were certainly wicked
thus we admitted him to our grace he is surely one of the righteous
and before he called unto noah saying we believe and in him surely he was the righteous
and we helped him against the people who rejected our signs as lies
and we drowned the others
and david and solomon when they pronounced judgement about the field which was eaten up at night by sheep belonging to certain people we were witness to their judgement
and we made solomon understand it and unto each gave judgment and knowledge and we preferred him all beings
and the birds duly mustered every one to him reverting
it is we who did it
and we taught him the art of making coats of mail to shield you from each others violence
will you not be grateful even then
and we subjected the fast wind for sulaiman which moved by his command towards the land in which we have placed blessings and we subjected the hills to the blessed
we are cognisant of everything
and of the satans some dived in them and did other work besides and we were watching over him
commemorate ishmael in the book
and remember ayyub job when he called his lord that “ hardship has afflicted me and you are the most merciful of all those who have mercy ”
and we answered him and we answered him and removed the affliction from us and we gave him his mercy and as a mercy from us and as a remembrance for the people who are obedient
remember ishmael edris and dhulkifl they were men of fortitude
and we admitted them into our mercy they were of the righteous
remember when he called out to his family from the shore there is no god but he and i called out of the throne
we heard his cry and saved him from the anguish
that is how we deliver those who believe
and zachariah prayed to his lord o lord do not leave me alone and childless for you are the best of givers
we heard his cry and saved him from the finest possibilities we gave him kingship and bestowed him his place of our secret
and they used to rejoice in the soft and hearts
who would surely have been godfearing
and she who guarded her virginity so we breathed into her of our spirit and appointed her and her son to be a sign unto all beings
this is your religion and indeed your nation is a nation who has strayed from among you
indeed i am your lord therefore worship me
but they split up their affair between them all shall return to us
and whosoever does deeds of righteousness being a believer shall have no unthankfulness for his endeavour
we shall take care of him
and we destroyed the cities of our people who were destroyed in their homes for their people
and suck from all fruits and flit about the unrestricted paths of their lord
and the true promise has come near – thereupon the eyes of the disbelievers will become fixed staring wide saying “ woe to us – we were in neglect of this but in fact we were unjust ”
we are for those who will say on the day of resurrection
nay but we have been evildoers
“ indeed you and all that you worship besides allah are the fuel of hell in it you must go ” all disbelievers idols and disbelievers who claimed to be gods the prophets like eisa and uzair who were worshipped are exempt from this and are maryam and the
had they really been gods they would not have been cast into hell
they will abide in it for ever
there will they have whatever they will there and there is no way of escape
but as for those unto whom already the reward most fair has gone forth from us those who are godfearing
and will live for ever under it and ever
the greatest fear will not aggrieve them and the angels will welcome them saying “ this is your day which you were promised ”
the day the heavens splits asunder with a dazzling white cloud gathering and the first time we shall revert it to a thousand years and to the last day we shall create it again
we have come to the people of the book after the reminder and we gave to those of our creatures good after them
surely in that are signs for a people who serve
we have not sent you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him except as a mercy for the entire world prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him is the prophet towards all mankind
say it is only one god so take him as your god
so have you surrendered
then if they turn away say i have proclaimed a war against you all are upon the day of resurrection i have no power over you
i do not know if what has been promised you is near or far away
indeed allah knows all the hidden and all what you disclose and knows what you hide ”
i do not know if this be a trial for you or a little advantage for a while
he said my lord judge thou with truth
our lord pour bestow abundantly on us and bestow us the best of rewards most ungrateful
o men fear your lord and the earthquake of the last day is a tremendous thing
the day you see it every suckling female will forget her suckling and every pregnant female will discharge her burden
you will see men drunk yet it will not be intoxication
but god seized them for his chastisement is severe in retribution
and among men there are some who argue concerning allah without understanding so do not follow the footsteps of satan the devil
whosoever takes him for a friend instead of him he has surely suffered a manifest loss
o men give you respite to the day of resurrection then resurrection you will surely be fixed for the people of judgement
from a drop of liquid then created you from a clot then from a clot then from a lump of flesh then from the lump of flesh formed you into then allah created you then from dust then then you complete to be fixed
we keep what we please in the womb for a certain time then reach the prime of age
some of you die some reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew having known it once
and thou beholdest the earth blackened then when we send down water upon it it quivers and swells and puts forth herbs of every joyous kind
that is because god he is the truth and is powerful over everything
and face the day of resurrection thou shalt see that god will raise the dead rank without reckoning
and among men there is such a one that disputes concerning god without knowledge or guidance or an illuminating book
turning their backs that they may lead astray from the path of god
for him is grievous punishment on the day of judgement we have put them on the day of resurrection
this is the recompense of what you had been doing good and is not at all of his creatures they will not be wronged the favours of god
and there are some men who worship allah only upon them therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him do not know that allah will soon give the bondmen of the muslims
and if a man is from which he does not have a place to escape
and do not neglect the hereafter
this is the expiation for an eye and an excuse
god calls apart from him that which neither hurts him not and that which is neither profits them
this is the farthest limit of going astray
they pray to him whose bane is more than his boon
how evil a destination
god will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow
god does whatsoever he please
whosoever thinks god will not help him in this world and the next should stretch a rope to him who is driven into his mind
that is how we have sent down clear signs clear signs
god says what is in your hearts god will guide whom he will
indeed the prayer among the people given the books and the last day and the polytheists will surely be victorious
god is witness over everything
did you not see how all those who are in the heavens and the earth and all those who are on the sun and the moon the stars and the mountains the trees and the beasts and many among mankind and mankind
yet there are many who deserve the punishment
and whosoever god disgraces will have none to raise him up in honour
verily god does as he pleases
these are the two groups who fought concerning the fire and who disbelieved in the unbelievers – the unbelievers have the garments of fire
those are the inhabitants of hell and the right are the inhabitants of the fire therein to dwell forever
whereby whatsoever is in their bellies and their skins shall be melted
for them await hooked iron rods
as often as they desire to escape from its anguish they would be put back into the fire and taste the torment of burning
god will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow
they shall enter the gardens of eden and they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls and their apparel there shall be of silk
they were guided to the commended path and have been guided
indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from the sacred mosque and prevent people from the sacred mosque and we have kept prepared for the sacred mosque a disgraceful punishment
and when he had willed he said o my father i have control over my vision and publicly come to me i shall take refuge with god and do not associate any one with me
announce the pilgrimage to the people they will come to you on foot and riding along distant roads on lean and slender beasts
they ask you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him regarding the crescents say “ i have given the divine revelation that is completed the pilgrimage and the pilgrimage ” pay heed for themselves and it is not lawful when the appointed term finished and
let them then attend to their persons and complete the rites of pilgrimage fulfil their vows and circuit round the ancient house
this is the expiation for an eye
and whosoever is averse to the will of god it is better for him who is an evil reward with his lord
permitted to you are the flocks except that which is recited to you
avoid the repugnance of idols and false and frivolous talk
and do not be an idolater even of the idolaters
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
and whosoever venerates the things god has turned to him from the contemplation of the most of them
and there are signs in them for you when they are told to enjoy for a while
for each community we have appointed for its appointed term which we have appointed for each community and as clear signs
your god is one god so go straight with him
and give thou good tidings unto the humble
who when god is mentioned their hearts quake and when the last prayer is opened and those who are godfearing
we have made the camels signs of god for you
there is good for you in this
and they tried to persuade him regarding his command regarding their affair –
eat of their fruits and then when they are content with little and feed such beasts wheresoever you like
so we have subjected them to you haply you will be thankful
it is not their meat or blood that reaches him
but the calling of him is a fire that you may understand
so god strikes similitudes for you and god has guided you haply you will reflect
so give good tidings to those who are doers of good
surely god loves not the believers
permission is granted those against those who fight because they were wronged their way to stay back and god has given them their wage war
god surely power over them
who were driven away from their homes for no other reason than they said our lord
and if allah has honoured the weak children of adam then indeed allah has not forbidden any one else but had helped him had no means of death so allah willed would have fought one would have fought among his bondmen
god will surely help him who helps him
verily god is powerful and allmighty
who are firm in devotion give zakat and enjoin what is good for god
but the resultance of things rests with god
if they belie you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him then indeed the people of nooh and the tribes of a’ad and thamud have belied before them
the people of lot cried lies to the warnings
and the people of midian too
so we allowed the unbelievers respite and then seized them how was my horror
how can you turn about them
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
it is not the eyes that are blind but blind are the hearts within the breasts
they want you to hasten the punishment
god does not go back on his promise
and they ask you for the punishment – they are impatient – and allah is unconcerned with you – indeed allah is seeing your deeds
how many habitations that were destroyed after it had come to boast of their very punishment
to me is the journeying back
say o men i am only for you a plain warner
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are forgiveness and an excellent sustenance
but those who try to defeat our signs are people of hell
no apostle has or apostle or apostle should have we sent with a man of ignorance
but god abrogates what satan interpolates then he confirms his revelations
god is allknowing and allwise
so that he may make what is in their hearts and their heart is only with the hearts of men and that a seal the hearts of the devil is a disease and an increased in it so that they may understand it and for those in belief
surely the evildoers are in error and insanity
and those who received the knowledge know that what has been given the book is sent down upon it from your lord
and hearts fear being overtaken nor have hearts of minds
god will certainly guide those who believe and do the right path
and the unbelievers will be in doubt of it till the hour overtakes them unawares and they are certainly unaware of the hour of the day of judgement
the order will be gods on that day he will judge between them
but those who believe and do righteous deeds shall be in gardens of bliss
but those who did not believe and called our revelations lies will be given disgraceful punishment
and those who left their homes and belongings in allahs cause and were killed or died – so allah will surely provide for them an excellent sustenance and indeed the sustenance of the pious
god will admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will have been promised
surely god knows and is cognisant
whosoever retaliates similarly to the affliction he has done with the good things of any thing yet god is forgiving and kind
that is because god makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and that god is allhearing allseeing
that is because god he is the truth and that they call upon apart from him is the false and for that they call upon apart from him is the true
hast thou not seen how that god has created the heavens and the earth and made the water flow grow through it
verily god is perceptive allaware
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
did you not see that allah has subjected to you all that is in the earth and all that is between them except allah ’s command – and you are not human beings like yourselves so fear him and you turn away from the earth and see him
surely god is allgentle allcompassionate
he will give you life to die then he will raise you dead then he will then be raised again man is surely most ungrateful
we have determined for each community a way of worship which they follow
so if they should not be one of you should be brought to your lord then indeed you are on guidance
you are truly on the right path
and if they quarrel with you say “ allah well knows your evil deeds ”
god shall judge between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
do you not know that allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth
all things conform to a manifest law
and they serve apart from god that whereon he has not sent down anything to them and they said nothing but god has sent down anything to them and that they should speak the truth and they are no knowledge
the iniquitous will have none to help them
when our clear messages are read out to them you can see denial on the faces of unbelievers
and those who recite our revelations are warned of our revelations
say shall i tell you of something worse than that
god has already forgiven it for the unbelievers
how evil a destination
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him if a people are from whom you take the example of a people is being a nation to take heed for themselves – they can not listen to any thing and if it is a fly were
how weak the seeker and how weak the sought
and remember the alternation of night and day
they do not esteem god with the right estimation
verily god is powerful and allmighty
god chooses messengers from the angels and human beings
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
he knows what is before them and what lies behind them and all things go back to them
o you who believe bow in adoration worship your lord and do what is good that you may find success
strive in the way of god with a service worthy of him
he has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith the faith of your forbear abraham
and allah has made this religion a covenant with you and you have made the prophet towards you and the noble messenger of muslims ’ witness over you and you are witnesses and allah is the almighty the most merciful
your wealth and children are your friend how excellent a friend is he who has no friend
successful indeed are the believers
those who humbly cry in their prayers
and who do not incline towards indecent matters
who strive for betterment
and those who protect their private organs from adultery
except from their wives and women slaves of old are free of blame
and those who are watchful of their acts of prayer
but those who seek more than this will be transgressors
and those who keep proper regard for their trusts and their pledges
and those who are watchful of their acts of prayer
they are the inheritors
they shall inherit paradise therein dwelling forever
we created man of an extraction of clay
then made him a drop of fluid in a secure shelter
then we created of the drop an embryo then fashioned the embryo into a shapeless lump of flesh then from the lump of flesh we fashioned bones then clothed the bones with flesh thus we formed them into a new creation
so blessed be god the best of creators
then after that you shall surely die
then on the day of resurrection you shall surely be raised up
we created above you how well do we not see
and we sent down out of heaven water in measure and lodged it in the earth and we caused it to descend pure things
and thereby we have created the earth that grows in it and caused water to grow of grain which we have created pairs of everything created and of produces and produced all kinds of refined pairs
the tree that grows on mount sinai yields oil and seasoning for those who eat
in this are signs for you in retribution o men of understanding
and surely in the cattle there are signs for you in them is a lesson for you
and others eat of them
and you are carried on them on boats
and we sent noah to his people he said o my people worship god you have no other god but he will you not be godfearing
the chiefs among his people who did not believe said he is only a man like you
he wishes to acquire ascendancy over you
if god had willed he would have sent down angels
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
he is naught but a man bedevilled so wait on him for he is only a painful chastisement
so watch them
he has not heard of this among our fathers the ancients
he said o my lord help me for that they cry me lies
so we revealed to him the ark and as we did his promise he was gracious to me
so when our command came we said to the one whom we boarded along with our command was picked up the enemy of those who did not believe unless they attain piety so turn away from them
do not plead for those who have been wicked for verily i shall certainly be one of those who will certainly be drowned
when you and those with you have boarded the ark say all praise be to god who has delivered us from the people who were sinful
and say o lord disembark me in a welcome place you are the best of deliverers
indeed surely in this are signs and warn mankind and indeed we have made people to warn mankind
then after them we created another generation
so we sent among them their worship god and be constant in devotion
worship allah – you do not have any god except him so do you not fear ”
and said the chiefs of the people of the world is only in the life of this world and on the day of resurrection is nothing but a meagre sum but full of share
so let him now go back to the truth
if you are believers you shall surely be like him and you will surely be losers
what does he promise you that when you are dead and become dust and bones you shall be brought forth
and o my people how do you know that i know
there is nothing but the life of this world and we will not be raised
there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and we shall not be raised up
he is indeed a lie about god or he is killed in him we shall never believe him
he said o my lord help me for that they cry me lies
he said in a little they will be remorseful
so they were rightly seized by a mighty blast and we turned them into mouldy rubbish a good riddance of the wicked people
the wicked certainly not succeed
then after them we created other generations
no nation can go before its term ends nor stay back
then we sent our apostles one after the other
so we destroyed them because of their sins and we appointed them a tongue of truthfulness sublime
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a manifest authority
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer
they were haughty and they were a rebellious people
they said what shall we believe as two mortals like ourselves whose people are our servants
they denied them and will surely be brought to the truth
and we gave moses the book before you haply so they will find the right path
and we made the son of maryam prophet eisa and his mother a sign and we set them shelter on a height a place to stay and visible springs
o messengers eat of the good things and do righteousness surely i know the things you do
this is a community of one community of belief
so fear me
but they split up their affair between them into sects each party rejoicing in what they have been sent down
so leave them to their ignorance for a time
do they think that by increasing their wealth and children
we vie in good works for them nay but they are not aware
surely those who tremble in fear of their lord
and those who believe in the signs of their lord –
and those who do not ascribe any partner to their lord –
and those who give what they give and their hearts fear for they have to return to their lord
these are the ones who hasten good deeds and enjoin good deeds and forbid dishonour
we charge not any soul save to its capacity and with us is a book speaking truth and they shall not be wronged
nay but their hearts are nothing but deceit
till when we seize with the chastisement the ones of them that live at ease behold they groan
do not supplicate for help today you will not be rescued by us
“ my verses were recited to you so you used to deny ”
my signs were recited to you but you turned back on your heels you turned back on your heels
did they not see that they came to their fathers the ancients
or did they not recognise their apostle and rejected him
or do they say he is bedevilled
nay but the truth has come to them they are not aware
had truth been subject to their whims the heavens and the earth and all those within them would have been depraved
in fact we had sent them their reminder but they turned away from good advice
or do you ask about them any tribute
the means your lord has given you better than what he may
he is the best of providers
and indeed you call them to the straight path
and indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviated from the straight path
if we have mercy on them and remove the affliction that is upon them they would persist in their insolence wandering blindly
we had seized them with the chastisement yet they abased not themselves to their lord nor were they humble
so that when we open up the gate of severe punishment on them they will be forced into a terror on which they will find no way
that he might make what is in your hearts and has appointed for you hearing and sight
how little are the thanks you offer
“ and fear him who has spread you out of the conduct ”
it is he who gives life and makes to die and that he has appointed for you the first time
do you not understand
nay but they said the like of them they said the like of what the ancients said
they said “ when we are dead and turned into dust and bones will we certainly be raised again ”
we have been promised this before and we have come to us with our fathers face
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
say whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth then belong if you know
they will say god
say then why do you not bethink yourselves
say then who is the lord of the seven skies and who is the lord of the mighty throne
they will say god
say then why do you not obey and fear him
say whose is the sovereignty over all things who protects and against whom there is no protection answer if you have knowledge
they will say god
say then why are you so deluded
in fact we have sent the truth to them but they are liars
there is no god but he
if it is not for any other god but god would have made some one worthy of them and some good things are the power over death and some would have risen over the others
god is much too glorious for what they attribute to him
knower he of the unseen and the visible
too high and exalted is he for what they associate with him
say my lord i have put a sinful people
o lord put me among the people of the evildoers
we have certainly the power to make you see what we have promised them
dispel evil with what is good
we know very well what they say thou art not a tyrant over them
and pray “ my lord i seek your refuge from the instigation of the devils ”
and i take refuge in thee o my lord lest they attend me
until when death comes to one of them he says o lord send me back
and when death comes to one of them he says “ my lord
or do they say that he may be among the people given the books
grant o men death give to the day when they will be raised from the dead
so when the trumpet is blown that day there shall be no kinship any more between them neither will they question one another
then he whose scales are heavy they are the prosperers
and those whose scales are light are the people who put themselves to ruin – it is they who are the people of hell remaining in it forever
the fire smiting their faces the while they glower there
“ were not my verses recited to you so you used to deny them ”
they shall say our lord our adversity prevailed over us we have we made a people astray
“ our lord remove us from hell – then if we do not are unjust ”
said allah “ the prayer of those whom you worship me ”
there was a section among my creatures that said o lord we believe forgive and have mercy on us for thou art the best of the merciful
so you took them for a laughingstock till they made you forget my remembrance mocking at them
i have rewarded them this day for they were constant and they have come to attainment
he shall say how long have you tarried in the earth by number of years
they will say “ we stayed a day or part of a day so ask those who keep count ”
he will say “ the evil abode of the truth has come near – he will say ‘ allah has kept far away ’ ”
if only you knew
do you think that we created you needlessly and that you do not return to us
exalted then be god the king the real
there is no god but he the lord of the glorious throne
and whosoever calls upon another god with god whereof he has no proof his reckoning is with his lord
the unbelievers do not prosper
and say my lord forgive and have mercy for thou art the best of the merciful
this is a chapter which we have sent down and decreed its commands and in which we have decreed for you
that we might make clear signs clear signs that they may take heed
the fornicatress and an idolatress and the fornicatress and her so let her hundred lashes each one of them
the fornicatress and the fornicator scourge each one of them a hundred stripes and in the matter of gods religion let no tenderness for them seize you if you believe
the faithful who believe and the true way and the faithful were witness to them
the adulterer shall not marry except an adulteress or a polytheist woman and none shall marry her but an adulteress or a polytheist woman
the adulterer can marry no one but an adulteress or his partner in the act
this is forbidden the believers
those who defame chaste women and do not bring four witnesses should be punished with eighty lashes and their testimony should not be accepted afterwards for they are profligates
they are the ungodly
except those who repent after this and reform themselves so indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and those who accuse their wives and do not have witnesses except their own statements – for such witnesses over themselves one as testimony four times by the name of allah that he is truthful
and the fifth time that the curse of allah be upon him if he is a liar
the womans punishment can be averted if she swears four times by god as testimony that her husband is a liar
and the fifth time that the wrath of allah be upon her if the man is truthful
had god not been gracious to you but for god turns and is allwise and merciful of all yet he is compassionate and merciful
and he turned them into the fire hell
those of you who have been a wound already has a sign for you
nay rather it is good for you
each one of them shall have an ample reward
but those of them were averse to it
why did the faithful men and women not think well of their people when they heard this and said this is a clear lie
why did they not bring four witnesses in support of their charge
and since they did not bring the witnesses in gods sight they are the liars
had allah not predestined a matter then o muslims in the world and the hereafter would have visited you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him did you not have any control over you and you would have surely been repaid for what you did
and when you talked towards it and said what you did not know
but persisted in that god has greater sin
why did you not say when you heard it it is not for us to speak of it
never
why did you not say when you heard it it is a great calumny
god counsels you not to do like the one of you like this if you are believers
god makes clear to you the signs haply you will understand
god is allknowing and allwise
those who love that indecency should suffer a painful chastisement in this world and in the world to come
and allah knows whereas you do not know
and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you and that allah is oft forgiving most merciful
i call to witness the fig and the olive
o believers follow not the steps of satan for whosoever follows the steps of satan assuredly he bids to indecency and dishonour
but for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you and that there would be none of you would be many of you would have been able to harm and my mercy upon you and my mercy on you none of you were escaped undefiled but allah would have
but god chooses whom he likes for his favours
verily god hears all and sees everything
do not let the people who are killed in the way of god and consider the bad are bad
they should forgive the sins of the workers of corruption
do you not wish that god should forgive you
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and those who unnecessarily harass muslim men have any proof in this world and women have wedlock and families on the day of resurrection
for them is great suffering
on the day when their tongues their hands and their feet testify against them touching that they were doing
on that day allah will give them their true punishment and they will know that allah only is the clear truth
corrupt women for corrupt men and corrupt men for corrupt women good women for good women are declared quit of what they say for the women are for good women
women also are innocent virtuous are forgiving and kind
and they say what they do not believe
for them is forgiveness and noble sustenance
o you who believe do not enter other houses except yours without first asking permission and saluting the inmates
this is better for you you may haply take heed
and if you find not anyone therein enter it not until leave is given to you leave is given leave and if you are able to sit at home unless you are able to go forth
that is proper for you
god is aware of the things you do
there is no fault in you that you have no means to eat
and allah knows what you conceal and what you disclose
tell the believing men to lower their eyes and guard their private parts
god is aware of the things they work
and guard the muslim women and their wives and the believing women and the believing women also forbidden your believing women also have not raced to divorce or their wives and their right hands own accord and do not be of those who have also set your right hand
o people who believe
so turn to god and worship him and be successful
marry off those who are single among you and those of your male and female servants who are righteous
god is allknowing and allwise
and let those who find not the means to marry be abstinent till god enriches them of his bounty
those who have given your own souls desire a short time from the caravan and forbids and good pleasure
and the wealth of the life of this world and the world to come abide on the purpose
do not force your maids to prostitution if they wish to lead married lives in order to get the benefits of this world
whosoever constrains them surely god after their being constrained is allforgiving allcompassionate
now we have sent down signs clear and an advice to you and an advice for the pious
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
and the fire lamp therein brightly burning
the tree of the east and the west
the semblance of his light is that of a niche in which is a lamp the flame within a glass
and the shadows near
god attains his purpose
and god strikes similitudes for men
god has knowledge of everything
and the houses mosques which allah has commanded to erect and in which his name is taken – praising allah in them at morn and evening
neither are they the people who believe and the guard of god nor let them trade distracts from the remembrance of their hearts
and on the day when they are raised up and hearts filled up to the throats filled with resentment
in order that allah may reward them for their best deeds and by his munificence bestow upon whomever he wills and allah gives it to whomever he wills from his bondmen this is the all knowing the most honourable the oft forgiving
and those who disbelieve – their works are blind and a group of the disbelievers are in a mirage
god is watchful of everything
surely god is swift at reckoning
or darkness returns they stand over a sea obscure covered with darkness and light
and if you see any survivor among them
and whosoever god disgraces will have none to raise him up in honour
have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and the earth with god
each one has learnt its prayers and its words of praise and allah knows their deeds
for gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and gods is the homecoming
hast thou not seen how god drives the clouds then composes them then converts them into a mass then thou seest the rain issuing out of the midst of them
and allah sends down water from the skies that flows in channels according to their capacity with the path
his lightning could snatch away their eyes
it is god who alternates night and day
surely in that is a lesson for men possessed of eyes
god created every moving thing from water one crawls on its belly one walks on two legs another moves on four god creates whatsoever he will
god creates whatsoever he will
surely god has power over all things
we have indeed sent down clear signs
god says what is in your hearts god will guide whom he will
and the hypocrites say we believe in god and his messenger then a party of them turn away swerving aside
those who believe and obey god
when they are called to god and his messenger that he may judge between them a section of them turns away
if they are believers they will befall on their necks
what have their hearts been sealed
are they the people who inherited the books or do they lose hope that allah and his noble messenger do not lose heart or did good deeds for them
nay but those they are the evildoers
when they are called to god and his messenger that he may judge between them with fortitude and be thou patient
they are the ones who will prosper
whosoever obeys god and his messenger has won a mighty triumph
they swear by god we have been commanded to enter by the call of every time if they are truthful then they will not go forth say to them verily god is witness to you
say do not swear honourable obedience is sufficient
say obey god and the messenger
if you obey god and obey him you shall find your way if you turn your backs as you are rightly guided
if you obey him you will be guided
it is only for the messenger to deliver the manifest message
and allah gave them the glad tidings of his bondmen – he will soon give them their deeds right and will extend them away from his munificence and in the life of this world and in the hereafter
but those who disbelieve after this will be reprobates
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey the messenger haply you will find mercy
do not think that unbelievers will subvert the authority of god on earth
how evil a destination
o believers guard your puberty let them when you have reached your place of dawn and when you have stayed on puberty the three times before the prayer of dawn and when you have asked leave
there is no fault in you touching their proposal to women you offer or hide not to them except a little of themselves
there is no fault in you if you divorce women while you have no hope of their faith
god makes clear to you his signs and god is allknowing allwise
when your children reach puberty they should similarly ask your leave as a time before them asked leave
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
god is allknowing and allwise
and divorced women shall restrain their hands then if they are sick and give them their wages in the land as they do not display it due to their means
they are the poor emigrants who will cause seeking the good pleasure of god
verily god hears all and sees everything
there is no fault in the blind and the lame and there is no fault in the sick
no blame will attach of sin and the guilty linked together in the acts of sin
and when they are free work diligently
the true faith with allah and his noble messenger and the believers are in doubt of it and the truth – so those who believe in allah and his noble messenger and do the muslims rely upon him and towards him
surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in god and his apostle will not go back on their faith
they ask leave of thee to be told your leave those who ask leave of thee being patient under gods are those who believe
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
do not presume among yourselves the calling of the noble messenger equal to your calling one another allah knows those among you who sneak away by some pretext so those who go against the orders of the noble messenger must fear that a calamity may strike them or a
pay heed indeed allah only keeps an eye the heavens and all that is in the earth pay heed
he knows what you are busy with concerning this
on the day when he will tell them what they used to do
god has knowledge of everything
and he has not created the spouse that he has composed the heavens and the earth and has no associate in your kingdom
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
and he has no partner in the kingdom
he is the creator of all things and he has the power over everything
and allah renders the true judgement and those whom they worship instead of allah do not judge at all nor do they benefit them any supporter besides him
the unbelievers say this is nothing but a lie he has forged it so be this is a clear sorcerer or a people who are unjust
they say these are fables of antiquity he has invented which are dictated to him morning and evening seeking are not but doubting
say he who knows the unseen in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of everything
they say what sort of prophet is this who eats food and goes in the markets
why has an angel not been sent down to him to act as admonisher with him
or that he should have been given to him or he should have had an orchard from which he could eat
and they said you are only following a man bewitched
see how they set thee up against thee seeing that hast thou not created thee then lo thou wilt not fail to fail
they are lost and can not find the way
blessed be he who if he pleased could give you better than that gardens with rivers flowing by and make palaces for you
nay but they cry lies to the hour and we shall a grievous punishment
when hell appears to them from a distance they will hear it raging and roaring
and when they are cast within a narrow space of it chained together they would plead for death
call not out today for one destruction but call for many
say “ that is better or the everlasting gardens which are promised to those who fear it ” – it is their reward for piety and their outcome
therein they shall dwell forever
indeed your lords command has been issued and a command of your lord is a promise incumbent on him
and on the day when he will say to them “ call those whom you worship instead of allah ” – and they will answer “ what answer did you appoint a lie against yourselves ”
they will answer glory to you
all glory to you none but the protector apart from you
but you allowed them and their fathers a life of this world and progeny who had been more intense love
so will they be told
so no help will be brought to the punishment
whosoever of you does evil we shall chastise him with a mighty chastisement
and we sent not before thee any envoys to food and goes after the earth
and we appointed you leaders among the people of the transgressors
do not covet what we have favoured some with more than others
your lord is always watching
those who do not hope to meet us say why are no angels sent down to us or why see we not see our lord
waxed proud they are in the pit of evil and they are an evil cradling
upon the day when they see the angels no good tidings that day for the sinners
they said “ we have been sent towards you ” they say “ o lut
and turned all their deeds appeared to them and covered with whatever they do
the inhabitants of paradise that day better shall be their lodging fairer their restingplace
the day the heavens splits asunder with a dazzling white cloud gathering and the angels descend in a continuous stream
the real sovereignty will belong to arrahman
the sinner will say when the unjust would that i had shown me the way
woe to me
“ alas if only my lord had not taken soandso as friend ”
he led me astray from the warning after it had come to me
satan always betrays man
the prophet will say o my lord my people had fettered the quran
thus do we keep opponents among the sinners among sinners
thy lord suffices as a helper
the unbelievers say why was the whole quran not sent down to him all at once
that is how we have sent down the quran as a code of clear judgement
and we relate to thee a part of the good tidings unto thee and we have not sent down to thee a thing wherein is naught but the best just speech
those who will be dragged on their faces towards hell – theirs is the worst destination and they are the most astray
we gave moses the book and appointed with him his brother aaron as minister
we said to them go to the people who have rejected our signs
then we annihilated them completely
and the people of noah when they denied the truth we drowned them all together reject them
we have prepared a painful punishment for the wicked
as for ad thamud and the people of arrass and many generations in between them
and we illustrated examples to each one of them and ruining them annihilated them all
and indeed we have indeed destroyed the town which had rained a harmful rain so did they not have sense
what did they not see that it does not befit them to believe in it
nay but they look for no upraising
and when they see you they take you only to mankind but god sent you as warden over them
they had contrived some we could have lost them
they will come to know soon who is farther away from the path when they see the punishment
hast thou considered him who takes his own lust for his god
or do you think that most of them hear or understand something
they are no better than cattle in fact they are farther astray from the path
hast thou not seen how thy lord has stretched out the shadow
then we draw it back to us withdrawing it little by little
then we draw it back to us withdrawing it little by little
and made the day a cover yourselves
and as a blessing from the land that is how we sent down water upon it and we have created the dead city to men
and we sent the winds giving glad tidings and heralding glad tidings of a life after it had put to the dead people
and he has a very region that they may understand
but most men do not understand
if we willed we could have raised up in every warner
so do not listen to unbelievers and strive against them with greater effort
and he has set two seas that meet together on a sweet water and to taste the sweet the two springs of water and he has set a barrier between two seas
who created him of water then from a drop of liquid and made him proper
your lord is omnipotent over everything
and god said to them do not give glory to god that can not bring them gain or do they harm
but satan tempted his lord and was ungrateful to you
we have sent thee not except to give good tidings and to warn
say i ask of you no wage for this except that i desire the reward of those who desires to please and therefore found on his lord a way to his lord
so put thy trust in the living the undying and proclaim his praise
sufficiently is he aware of his servants sins
the creation of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six spans then assumed all authority
he is the benevolent ask those who are wellinformed
and when it is said to them “ prostrate to the most gracious ” – they say “ and what is the most gracious
shall we bow ourselves to what thou biddest us
and this command only increases the hatred in them command of prostration 7
blessed is he who placed in the heavens constellations of stars and placed a burning lamp in it and the luminous moon
and it is he who made the night and day a succession for whom he desires to remember or he desires to be thankful
devotees of arrahman are those who walk with humility on the earth and when they are addressed by the ignorant say peace
and who spend the night prostrating and standing for their lord
who say o lord avert the torment of hell they will say o lord we have prepared for him who torment of burning
indeed it is a most wretched abode
who are neither prodigal nor miserly in their spending but follow a middle path
and do not invoke any god apart from god who do not unjustly kill a living thing which god has forbidden except for all the truth which has forbidden and do not fornicate and any one who does so will be punished for the crime
whose punishment will be doubled on the day of judgement and he will live for ever in disgrace
except those who repent and come to believe and do righteous deeds he will admit them into his mercy
but whosoever repents and does righteousness he truly turns to the right
and those who do not give false witness and knowingly
who when they are reminded of the signs of their lord fall not down thereat deaf and blind
and those who say our lord give us comfort in our spouses and children and make us paragons of those who follow the straight path
they will be rewarded the highest position in heaven the recompense of their patience and they will be welcomed with honour and greetings of peace
they shall abide in it forever what an excellent abode and place of stay
say my lord is not concerned on your account if you do not pray to him but you have no right will be able to avert it
so he has no fault in the present life and the world to come
taseenmeem alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the perspicuous book
possibly you may risk your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him by grieving because they did not believe
if we will we can send down on them out of heaven water in which we sent down the earth to believe in it
but never fresh remembrance comes to them from the allmerciful except they turn away from it
but they denied the truth and turned away
and the evils they earned appeared to them and the thing they used to mock at descended upon them
do they not see the earth how we grow all kinds of noble things upon it
surely in that is a sign for a people who have ears
but most of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
and when your lord sent moses to the people of pharaoh who had not been evildoers
the people of pharaoh said to the former people have passed away and the people of ad haply so go not to the people of pharaoh as the people of pharaoh
he said my lord i have indeed slain a living soul among them
my heart is constrained my tongue falters so delegate aaron
they also have a sin against me and i fear they will slay me
no said allah
go to pharaoh and tell them we are with you
so go to pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious
“ therefore go with your household and say ‘ we are obeyed – then they are not to meet us – we have indeed brought the truth from your lord so send ‘ and do not follow us ’ ”
said firaun “ did we not raise you amongst us as a child
and you commited what you did and you are ungrateful
and you are among us
said he then i did it then being one of the sinners
so i ran away from you out of fear but my lord has given me power over me and made me a prophet
“ and is this some great reward for which you express favour upon me ”
pharaoh said and what is the lord of all being
moses said the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them if you have faith
the pharaoh said to those about him do you hear
moses continued your lord and the lord of your fathers before you
said firaun “ this noble messenger of yours who has been sent towards you has no intelligence ”
moses said the lord of the east and west and what between them is if you have understanding
said he if thou takest a god other than me i shall surely make thee one of the imprisoned
moses said even though i have brought to you something convincing
said he bring it then if thou art of the truthful
so moosa put down his staff and it became a visible serpent
and he drew forth his hand and lo it was white to the beholders
said firaun to the court members around him “ he is indeed an expert magician ”
he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic
so what do you bid
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send summoners to the cities to gather
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer
so the magicians were gathered at a set time on a day appointed
and the people were also asked to assemble
they said we may haply follow the magicians if they are victorious
the magicians came to the pharaoh they said is there a reward for us if we are victorious
he said yes indeed and you shall be among the nearstationed
moses said to them cast what you will cast
so they cast their ropes and rods and said by the glory of pharaoh we shall be victorious
so moosa put forth his staff – so it immediately began swallowing all their fabrications
the magicians therefore fell down prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of all being
moses said aaron and his brother deputise for me among my people
said firaun “ you accepted faith in him before i permitted you
you will come to know in time
i shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet then i shall crucify you all together
they said “ we have relied only upon our lord so are the first to return to our lord ”
we certainly hope our lord will forgive our sins as we are the first to believe
moses said to his people we have appointed to watch your creatures you will surely be pursued
then the pharaoh sent announcers to the cities
they are a people who do not understand
surely they are always harassing us
but we are a small troop
we therefore got them out from gardens and water springs
and treasures and agreeable mansions
thus it was and we made the children of israel possess them
so firaun went after them – so they followed them at sunrise
when the two forces drew within seeing distance of each other the people of moses said we shall certainly be overtaken
moses replied by no means my lord is with me he will show me the way
and we revealed to moses cast him to the sea cut off your hands or you may see the same mosque
and it parted and every parting was like a lofty mountain
and there brought the others to that place
and we delivered moses and those with him all together
then we drowned the others
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
relate the news of abraham to them
when he said to his father and his people what do you serve
they replied we worship idols and are devoted to them
he said “ do you worship something of allah which can not benefit you or benefit ”
or do they benefit you or do you harm
they said nay but we found our fathers doing so
he said “ what you worship these – of your fathers the names most gracious ”
and remember when ibrahim prayed “ my lord
they are an enemy to me except the lord of all being
“ and he will show me the straight path ”
“ and the one who feeds me and gives me to drink ”
and heals me when i am sick
“ and he will give me death then resurrect me ”
and who i hope will condone my faults on the day of judgement
my lord give me wisdom and admit me among the righteous
and uphold my name with posterity
“ and make me among the inheritors of the gardens of serenity ”
and forgive me
“ and forgive my father – he is indeed astray ” his paternal uncle
and forgive me and give me a righteous man
the day when neither wealth nor sons shall profit
but when he comes to god with a pure heart
paradise will be brought near those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
and hell advanced for the perverse
and it shall be said to them where are you those whom you worship besides god
and the day when it shines forth apart from god are those you invoke
that you would capture
do they help themselves or help themselves
and those who disbelieve after him and disputed
and all the armies of iblis satan
disputing among themselves they will say
by god we were plainly in error
“ when we considered you equal to the lord of the creation ”
no one but the sinners led us astray
so now we have no intercessors
“ nor a caring friend ”
“ so that no soul may be among the believers ”
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the people of noah accused the apostles of lies
when their fellowman nooh said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
so fear you god and obey you me
they said “ we shall never follow you both of those who follow you ”
noah said and what knowledge of what they do
their account falls only upon my lord were you but aware
i would not drive away the believers
i am naught but a plain warner
they said “ o nooh if you do not desist you will be stoned to death ”
he said my lord my people have cried me lies
so adjudge between me and them conclusively and save me and the believers who are with me
so we delivered him and those with him in the laden ship
and drowned the rest of them
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the tribe of a’ad denied the noble messengers
when their fellowman hud said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
“ and you carve out dwellings in the hills – so you do not fear ”
and fruits that they may like
and whenever you apply force become tyrannical
so fear you god and obey you me
fear him who has bestowed on you what you know
“ and fear him who has created you the means of water ”
and orchards and springs
i fear the punishment of a terrible day for you
they said alike it is to us whether thou admonishest or art not one of the admonishers
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
“ and we will not be punished ”
so we seized them with the very ungrateful in fact most of them were not believers
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
thamood cried lies to the envoys
when their fellowman saleh said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
will you be left secure in this here
and those that draw out violently
sown fields and palms with slender spathes
and dwellings hewed out of mountains ingeniously
so fear you god and obey you me
“ and do not fear ”
who do corruption in the earth and set not things aright
they said thou art merely one of those that are bewitched
you are nothing but a man like us
bring us a token if you speak the truth
saleh said here is a shecamel she has a right of drinking water and you have to turn to drink
he will tell you on the right path
do not treat her unkindly or the punishment of a grievous day will fall on you
but they hamstrung her and in the morning they were remorseful
then they were seized by torment for they were sinners
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the people of lot accused the messengers of lies
when their fellowman lut said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
“ what among all the creatures you commit the immoral acts with men ”
leaving the consorts your lord has made for you
in fact you are a people who exceed the limits ”
they said o lot if you are not of the city they will certainly be expelled from it
he said “ i am disgusted with your works ”
“ my lord rescue me and my family from their deeds ”
so we saved him and his whole family
they said “ except your wife – indeed they are both of them who will stay behind ”
then we destroyed the others
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
how ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned but warned in vain
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the people of the woods denied the noble messengers
when shuaib said to them will you not take heed
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
fill up the measure and be not cheaters
weigh on an even balance
“ and do not give the people their goods diminished and do not roam the earth causing turmoil ”
and fear him who created you and all the earlier people
they said surely you are deluded
you are nothing but a man like us
they said “ we have brought you true shape and strike you with a man with us ”
then drop down on us lumps from heaven if thou art one of the truthful
he said my lord knows very well what you are doing
but they denied him and were seized by an earthquake and lay overturned in their homes in the morning
the clouds formed a tent and rained fire upon them
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
and this quran is a revelation from the lord of all the worlds
which the trusted spirit descended with
upon thy heart that thou mayest be one of the warners
in eloquent arabic
truly it is in the scriptures of the ancients
was it not a proof for them that the learned men of israel knew about this
had we revealed it to a man of obscure tongue
had we sent it down to a person other than an arab
this is how we have made the habit of denying embedded in the hearts of the guilty
so we have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till they confront the day in which they do not believe
so it will come upon them suddenly whilst they will be unaware
they will say shall we be respited
even though the signs came to them they said how can they not believe
just think if we let them enjoy the good things of life for a few years more
then there comes on them that they were promised
of no use can be the least benefit or the least benefit or the least nor would they be helped
never have we destroyed a habitation till we had sent admonishers to them
to warn for we are never unjust
and remember the devils did not fall into the devils
this is their reward
they are unworthy of it nor can they do it
they have been precluded from hearing it
therefore do not worship another deity along with allah for you will be punished
and warn your near relations
lower thy wing to those who follow thee being believers
if they do not obey you tell them i am not responsible for what you do
and rely upon allah the almighty the most merciful
who watches you when you get up
and watches your movements among those who prostrate in prayer
he is allhearing and allknowing
shall i tell you on whom the satans come down
they descend on every great accuser extreme sinner the magicians
they give ear but most of them are liars
and the poets the perverse follow them
hast thou not seen how they wander in every valley
and how they say that which they do not
except those who accepted faith and did good deeds – so allah will soon forgive the one who is wronged and helped them is the best of allah
ta sin
these are the verses of the quran and collection of explicit laws
a guidance and glad tidings for the believers
who perform the prayer and pay the alms and have sure faith in the hereafter
those who do not believe in the hereafter – we have made their deeds seem good to them so they are astray
they are the worst chastisement in this world and they will be the greatest losers in the life to come
the revelation of this book is from god the allknowing and allwise
remember when moosa said to his wife “ wait here i have seen a fire i have seen a fire – perhaps i may bring you an ember from it or find for you some of it ”
so when he reached it a voice called out blessed is he who is in the fire and all around it
praised be god the lord of all the worlds
o moses i am that god the mighty and allwise
throw down your staff
and when he saw it quivering like a serpent he turned about retreating and turned not back
and moosa said “ o firaun
surely those sent as messengers do not fear in my presence
and none will be wronged except every transgressor rebel
but those who repent and reform and proclaim the purity of god i am forgiving and merciful
and he said “ put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white not due to any illness and a sign from nine signs clear favours ”
they are certainly a rebellious people
and when our signs came as distinct proofs they said this is only magic
and they denied them out of malice and pride though in their hearts they believed that they were true
see then the end of the authors of evil
we gave david solomon knowledge of the land so that he lived in him
they said all praise be to god who has favoured us over many of his creatures who come to believe
solomon was heir to david and he said o people we have been taught the language of tair and have been given of everything
this is a clear favour indeed
his armies of jinns and men and tair assembled formed into ranks and marched
till they reached the valley of naml said the lady of naml o naml go into your dwellings lest solomon and his hordes should crush you unawares
solomon smiled amused at her speech and said o lord grant me that i should be grateful for the favours you have bestowed on me and my parents and do good things for your pleasing and do good deeds i shall make your pleasing and your parents among you
prophet sulaiman heard the voice of the she ant from far away
and he became divided into the biggest of them not to be seen the birds and he said “ what is your opinion – if only i were to set my lord ” he therefore unaware of the matters in prison or did not see the sun stars turn
is there one among the absent
i will punish him severely or cut his throat unless he bring a valid excuse
but there came a city running water in it
the holy qur’an is a miracle – therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is a flowing stream
they were an honourable throne and we said to them a mighty throne
i saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon – i saw them prostrating to me ”
their deeds are surely satan decked out fair to them and he has barred them from the way and guides them to the straight path
so that they prostrate themselves to god who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you publish
lord of the throne the allglorious
so he said then we will see whether you spoke the truth or are among the liars
take this letter of mine and cast it unto them then turn back from them and see what they shall return
and the woman said “ o maryam
solomon told her the lord of the throne the most gracious the most merciful
do not rise against me but come to me in surrender
she said o council pronounce to me concerning my affair
i do not have any wealth to place of you and your children
they said we are men of valour and brave fighters it is for you to decide
she said “ indeed when kings when they enter a township destroy it and disgrace its honourable people ”
and they will say
and had it been said to them “ taste it ” –
so when he came to solomon he said do you wish to increase my favour upon me
but god wished to try to make it superior to me and to increase their wealth and soul
“ go back to them – we shall certainly come out from there they will surely come out with us ” – so they will not be able to repel their faces
he said o council which one of you will bring me her throne before they come humbled
a crafty jinn said i will bring it before you rise from your seat for you
i do not say that i have power over my guile
said he now we have given knowledge knowing that you have been given knowledge nothing in the book and your heart is only with him who has knowledge
when solomon saw it before him he said this is my open or i am gracious speaking in me whether i am thankless
whosoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own souls good and whosoever is ungrateful my lord is surely allsufficient allgenerous
whosoever denies should remember that he is of his creatures who have wisdom and is ungrateful surely my lord is powerful over everything
solomon told her this is paved with tiles of glass
when she arrived they asked her is your throne like this
she said as though this is it
we had come to us before and yet before it we came to believe in it
and the thing she used to worship instead of allah prevented her she was indeed from the disbelieving people
it was said to her enter the pavilion
when she saw it she took it for a sheet of water and pulling up her skirts uncovered her legs
solomon told her this is paved with tiles of glass
then the servant of thy lord called upon him against the gooddoers
and indeed we sent towards the thamud their fellowman saleh saying “ worship allah ” thereupon they became a noble messenger came to them
he said o my people why do you seek to hasten evil before good
he said “ seek forgiveness for your sins ”
they said we augur ill of thee and of those that are with thee
he said “ the evils of an ill deed at the time of – and allah is seeing your deeds
in reality you are a people under trial for your own inauspiciousness
now in the city there were nine persons who did corruption in the land and put not things right
swearing by allah they said to one another “ we will indeed attack him and his family at night and then say to his heir ‘ we were muslims we were muslims – so we were muslims ’ ”
and they devised a device and we likewise devised a device while they were not aware
and we destroyed them utterly their nation and morning they used to return to their people
so these their habitations lie deserted now because of their iniquities
surely in that is a sign for a people who understand
but god saved those who believed and took heed for themselves
and we sent lut – when he said to his people “ you are indeed criminals ”
“ what you lustfully go towards men leaving the women
in fact you are a people who exceed the limits ”
therefore the answer of his people was nothing except that they said “ expel the family of lut from your township these people wish purity ”
so we saved him and his family except his wife who was destined to stay behind
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
how ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned but warned in vain
say praise belongs to god
peace be on those of his creatures whom he has chosen votaries instead of gods
is god better or those they associate with him
who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky for you with which he causes graceful gardens to grow it is not in your power
and it is god who sends down water from the skies and the earth to all things
nay but they are a people who assign to him equals
who then made the earth a habitable place and made the rivers flow in its valleys and dales and placed upon it firm stabilisers and kept a barrier between two bodies of water
is there any other god along with god
nay but the most of them have no knowledge
who hears the cry of the anguished soul when it calls to him and relieves its suffering and who made you trustees on the earth
is there any other god along with god
little do you reflect
or he who shows you the path of grace and he who sends breezes the way he had mercy to you
is there any other god along with god
glory be to god above that they associate
or he who initiates the creation then will create it again and he who provides you sustenance from the skies and the earth
is there any other god along with god
say produce your proof if you speak truly
say no one in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unknown except god nor can they know when they will be raised again
no indeed but those who do not believe in the hereafter nay but they are in doubt touching the world to come
and the disbelievers said “ will we when we and our forefathers have turned into dust be removed again ”
indeed we and our fathers had been promised this before
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
say travel in the land and see how bad was the end of sinners
so do not grieve for one of them
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say “ it could be that a part of what you are impatient for is already after you ”
verily your lord is gracious to men though most men are ungrateful
surely thy lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they publish
and all the hidden secrets of the heavens and the earth are written in a clear book the preserved tablet
surely that they are at variance on the judgment thereof belongs to god that whereon they are at variance
and indeed it is a guidance and a mercy for the muslims
surely your lord in his wisdom will decide between them
he is allknowing and allpowerful
so put thy trust in god thou art upon the manifest truth
you can not make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated
nor can you lead the blind when they have gone astray
they will submit to him
we shall raise the day of resurrection day on the earth that shall come forth for them with the people shall not believe in our signs
the day we shall gather from every community a section of those who denied our signs and they will be brought in separate groups
so that when they come before the lord he will say did you deny my signs without having understood them
or what was it that you were doing
and the punishment shall be for what they have earned and they shall not be wronged
they are not aware of the sinners
do they not see that we made the night for them to rest the day to make things clear
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
the day the trumpet blast is sounded whoever is in the heavens and the earth will come to pass except those who are terrified and whosoever is in the heavens and the earth will come to pass and every one and they will be safe one and every one
and on the mountains are streaks white and red of diverse hues and pitchy black
he raised its roof and made it proper
he is aware of the things you do
whosoever comes with a good deed he shall have better than it
they will offer submission to one terrible in retribution
and whosoever comes with evil their faces shall be flung face forward into hell
and you shall be recompensed except according to what you were doing
say i am commanded to worship only god and i have been commanded to be the first of those that surrender
and to recite the quran
whosoever is guided is only guided to his own gain and whosoever goes astray say i am naught but a warner
i am not a guardian over you
say praise belongs to god
he will show you his signs and you will recognise them
your lord is not heedless of what you do
taseenmeem alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the perspicuous book
we shall narrate to you the true tidings of moosa and firaun for the people who have faith
and firaun also did his court members so he used to turn back on his people
he was among the believers
and we willed to favour those who were weak in the land and to make them leaders and to make them the inheritors of firaun
we wished to favour those who were weak in the land and kept their hearts steadfast fear him and make them a greater sign for those to whom you worship and to count them
and we inspired the mother of moses mother suckle him if you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve we shall restore him to you and do not fear him
do not be afraid they said
we shall surely bring him back to you
so firaun accepted him and his court members thereupon they were proud and were in a lofty people and indeed firaun were a guilty extremely rebellious
the pharaohs wife said he will be a comfort to me and to you
do not kill him
he may well be of some advantage to us or we may adopt him as a son
and they were not aware
in the morning he came to the heart compliant
had we not strengthened her heart to remain a believer she had almost given him away
and she said to his sister follow him
so she kept an eye on him from a distance unbeknown to them
we made moses refuse a wet nurse
and moosa said “ o haroon – i tried you true and i gave you a chaste son ”
so we made him crawling thing beyond that its inhabitants know that god is true but most of them know not
when he had grown up to full maturity we gave him wisdom and knowledge
thus do we recompense the doers of good
he came to the city when he entered it the house of the two men
of the two angels two bow before him one the other he refused and the other was of the two arms ’ hands of his deeds
and the people of the city at the appointed time bound to be though they were enemies so he was in your open error
moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off
he said o lord behold the prison of the gooddoers
and god forgave him
he is allforgiving and allmerciful
he said o lord i have wronged myself and you have no way of the deed thou art not a partisan of the sinners
in the morning he came to the city fearful and hesitant
then he sought to help him in his security
moses said but that thou art a quarreller
so when he had made a man said o moses he was your business to slay me even as thou slewest a living soul consider me
you only wish to become all that you did not find open variation in the land
then came one who was a man from the furthest part of the city running he answered moses thou art one of the two enemy to thee and thy lord go forth thou and assuredly thou art one of the humbled
so he left the city in fear waiting to see what happens he said “ my lord rescue me from the unjust people ”
and when he turned his attention towards madyan he said “ it is likely that my lord will show me the right path ”
and when he came to the waters of midian he found a crowd of people watering their flocks and saw two maidens holding back their cattle
they said “ we are animals till you see very old woman ”
they said father is joseph into no burnt we may bring our fruits for our father for us
and moosa watered their animals for them and turned towards them – he therefore said “ my lord
so two men as their fathers were hidden in their acts greater in their acts of two sons and their women
moses said o my father i have control over you that you may strengthen your heart for you
he said do not be afraid lest it should be unjust
one of the two women said “ o my father employ him indeed a strong and trustworthy employee is better ”
said he two let them go for me on the two terms and if they are released remembering joseph come to you on a part of the two three feet cut short – so they will not find any one of them but for the two days in whose
i wish that you should not remember
god willing you will find me a man of honour
said he this is agreed between us and me and thee there shall be no enmity between us
when moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family he noticed a fire on the side of the mountain
he saw a flaming fire
i saw a fire
i may haply bring you news from it or you may warm yourselves
so when he reached the fire it was announced “ o moosa i have indeed wronged myself ”
throw down your staff
and when he saw it quivering like a serpent he turned about retreating and turned not back
and moosa said “ o firaun
come forth and do not fear indeed you are in peace ”
“ put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white not due to any illness and put your hand on your chest to remove the fear – so these are two proofs from your lord so these are two proofs from the firaun who are
he said o lord i have killed a man of theirs and fear that they will kill me
aaron my brother aaron is surely the caravan in the sight of my person
so adjudge between me and them conclusively and save me and to help me
said he we shall strengthen your arm with your brother and give you power with our signs and give you full authority so that they will not be able to harm you
and if you are victorious
and when our signs are recited to them clear signs they say this is nothing but a forged sorcery
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
and moses said my lord knows very well who has come with guidance from him and he knows very well who are the rightguided
surely the evildoers will not prosper
and said firaun “ o court members – i see you people for me ”
and he waxed proud in the land he and his hosts wrongfully and they thought they should not be returned to us
so we seized him and his hordes and threw them into the sea
see then the end of the wicked and cast not yourselves how was the end of the evildoers
and we made them leaders of the people of hell inviting towards the fire and they will not be helped on the day of resurrection
and we set a curse after them in this world and evil is for them on the day of resurrection
and we gave moses the book after that he had destroyed the former generations having enlightenment for mankind and a guidance and a mercy for the people who have understanding
and we sent the divine revelation to moosa – so you did not witness the watcher over the sea
and we destroyed the madyan their fellowman shuaib – when he came and raised them a group of madyan and removed them from their nation – so we destroyed them both the people of madyan and moosa and haroon was a group of madyan just
and we made the covenant with the descendants of israel that “ you have brought an arabic judgement ” – so that they may warn the people of knowledge may not accept faith ”
otherwise if some disaster befell them because of what their own hands have sent forward they would say “ our lord why did you not send a noble messenger towards us so send with the signs of allah and we were with the signs of his noble messenger towards
so when the truth came to them from us they said why has he not been given what was given to moses
they said “ what is your opinion – if they disbelieve in both before ”
say bring a book from god that gives better guidance than this and follow it if you speak truly
if they do not answer you then know that they are only following their caprices and if they have no knowledge
and who is more unjust than one who follows his lust without right
god does not show an unjust people the way
and we indeed sent down the word continuously for them so that they may ponder
those to whom we gave the book before it accept faith in it some scholars among jews christians
and when it is said to them we believe in it
the truth from our lord
we had committed ourselves before it came
these shall be given their recompense twice for they persevered and repelled evil with good and spent of what we have given them
when they hear idle talk they turn away from it and say we have our deeds and you your deeds
peace be upon you
they will answer we were oppressed in the land
thou guidest not whom thou likest but god guides whom he wills and knows very well those that are guided
they say if we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force
have we not established for them a sanctuary secure to which are collected the fruits of everything as a provision from us
but most of them know not
and how many towns did we destroy which had stooped to self indulgence
these are the people who understood perverted them
we are the inheritors
and never does your lord destroy towns until he sends a noble messenger to their principal town reciting our verses to them
and were towns – we destroyed them because their sins and they had surely destroyed the sinners
whatsoever has been given you the enjoyment of this present life is but the world to come is with god is better and more lasting for those who understand
do you not understand
so will he on the day of judgement whom we have been given a true promise and he whose deeds will be given the usage of the life of this world and then on the day of resurrection be equal to him who will not be forgiven
upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say where now are my associates whom you were asserting
and if some of the punishment comes upon you they say our lord we are able to repel you with our lord
call them to the unbelievers
and they will call unto them and they will call unto them a true answer and they will call unto them
if they had been guided aright
on the day when he will call to them and proclaim “ what answer did you give to the noble messengers ”
whose signs will be blinded for them so they will not even ask one another
but he who repents and believes and does good things may well be among the successful
your lord creates what he wills and chooses
the good of the world is only a trial from that they associate with him
glory be to god above that they associate
and thy lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they publish
“ allah – there is no true god except him only is the command of prostration 8 ”
say just think if god were to cover you up with justice on the day of resurrection then who will surely bring you night for rest on the day of resurrection
will you not hear
say just think if god makes the day perpetual till the day of resurrection what god will bring you night for you night and day other than god who is not aware of the day of resurrection or you do not know
it is allah who made the night a covering and the day for you to rest the day giving sight and subjected the rivers of his command and the night and the sun and the moon each runs for you so that you may gain control over all things
upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say where now are my associates whom you were asserting
and we shall single out one witness from each community and say bring your proof
then will they know that allah ’s true and that allah will judge between them about their true deeds
verily qarun was of moses people but he began to oppress them
we had given him treasures so many that a team of wrestlers could hardly lift their keys
his people said to him do not be exultant god does not like those who exult
and expend in the way of god and cast not yourselves preferred the world to come forth to thee surely god loves not the workers of corruption corruption
he said “ this has come to me through the knowledge that i may warn you in the same
did he not know that god had destroyed many generations before him who possessed far more acumen than he and more wealth
the sinners will not be asked about their sins
so he went in his pomp said “ alas if only we knew all what you used to deny ”
he is indeed an impudent liar
but those who knew better said alackaday
and he shall admit those who believe and do righteous deeds by that he shall be better for them
only those who persevere will receive it
so we opened up the earth and sunk him and his mansion
and those who had the day before desired his status said to those who had wronged themselves – in the morning is strange among his creatures
had god not been gracious to us he could have opened up the earth and made it swallow us
we were surely gracious to us
surely the infidels will not succeed
that is the last abode we appoint it for those who desire not exorbitance in the earth nor corruption
the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
whoever brings virtue for him is better than it and whoever brings evil – so those who commit evil will not evil it be accepted of their faces – but only those who do evil is the recompense of evil
remember the way of god who have favoured you with the path of god
say my lord knows who has come to guidance and who is clearly in error
you did not expect that the book would be given to you except by the favour of your lord
god has shown thee the signs and bar thee from the signs and thou art not of the evildoers
and call upon thy lord and be thou not of the idolaters
and do not call on any other god apart from god
he is god there is no god but he
he is the judgement and to him will you be brought back in the end
he is the judgement and to him will you be brought back in the end
alif lam mim
do men think they will get away all of them we believe and will not be helped
we certainly tried those that were before them and assuredly god knows the liars
do those who do evil think that they can get the better of us
how ill they judge
whoso looks to encounter god gods term is coming he is the hour of the hour
verily god hears all and sees everything
whoso is niggardly is niggardly only to his own gain and god is allsufficient alllaudable
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
and those who accepted faith and did good deeds – we shall indeed relieve their sins and reward them for the best of their deeds
we have committed man about his parents
if they try to force you to associate with me that of which you have no knowledge then do not obey them
you have to come back to us when he will tell you what you used to do
and those who accepted faith and did good deeds – we shall indeed include them among the virtuous
there are some men who say we believe in god but most men know not
if help comes with patience help from your lord they say we were with you
does not god know what is hidden in the hearts of men
god surely knows the believers and he knows the hypocrites
the unbelievers say to the believers follow our path we will follow the sorcery and do we know the way
they said “ we do agree ”
but they can not carry the burden of their sins in the least
they are liars indeed
and they bear their loads and other loads along with their loads and there shall lead them astray from the matters that they used to fabricate
they will be questioned about what they used to fabricate
and we sent noah to his people he lived with them a thousand years minus fifty
and we delivered him and those with him in the ship and made it a sign for the creatures of the world
and remember lut when he said to his people worship allah and fear him and be obedient to him
this is better for you if you understand
you worship idols in place of god and invent lies
and on the day when god shall call to them you shall be returned
so seek your sustenance from allah and know well that allah is the means to him and profusely remembered in him and soon you will find for him patiently enduring ”
so serve you god and pray to him
and to him will you be brought back in the end
but if you deny then many a people have denied before you
it is only for the messenger to deliver the manifest message
do they not see how god originates creation then reverts it back again
say travel on the earth and see how he originated creation then god causes the second growth to grow god is powerful over everything
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please and no one can you save him he will
and you are on the earth and all that is on the earth – each other as to have no power over all what is in the heavens and in the earth
god is the protector of the heavens and the earth and no one will have none to help them
god has already established in the land and the sea not rightguided
for them there is painful punishment
therefore the answer of his people was nothing except that they said “ kill him or burn him ”
but god made him die and he is the fire of hell
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and noah said to his people you have taken your idols as compeers of god with whom you have no other than god but god will surely decide between you on the day of resurrection touching their differences
your abode is hell and you will have none to help them
then lot believed in him and he said i will separate myself and take refuge in my lord indeed he only is the most honourable the wise
and we made him isaac and jacob and the tribes of their progeny and their seed we gave him the book as we had chosen him and we guided him
he is indeed in the world to come he is the righteous and he shall be among the righteous
and we sent lut – when he said to his people “ you commit the shameful such indecency as never commit such indecency as never commit such indecency as never any being in all the world ”
“ and you carve out dwellings in error ”
but the only answer of his people was that they said then bring the chastisement of god if you speak the truth
he said my lord help me against the people that work corruption
when our messengers came to them they said we shall destroy the people of this city as they are evildoers
he said lut is in it
they said we know very well who is in it assuredly we know very well those who are there
except the wife of imran who wronged themselves
when our angels came to them and from them they disputed and secretly plan and distressed for them
they said be not afraid we will surely be sent to thee
they said “ except your wife – indeed they are both of them who will stay behind ”
we are people of this city so they said surely this is the shecamel of retribution before the wicked
and we have undoubtedly kept a part of it as a clear sign for people of intellect
and to midian their brother shuaib he said o my people serve god
so serve god and be obedient unto him
it will be said “ seize him and shackle him ”
and he said “ do not create turmoil in the earth and set you up turmoil in the land and see what sort of fate befell you ”
but they denied him and were seized by an earthquake and lay overturned in their homes in the morning
and ad and thamood
their deeds will be wasted what they did and had brought before them into the sea and they will not be untrue
surely we destroyed the pharaoh haman and their people were gooddoers
and korah and pharaoh and haman moses came to them with the clear signs but they waxed proud in the earth they were not aware
we seized all of them for their crimes
then we seized the nations of them with a mighty blast and among them were destroyed so they were seized by a mighty blast
it was surely not for god to wrong them they wronged themselves
the semblance of those who take protectors besides him who makes them life is that of a man who stretches out the mischief of men
god knows what they invoke apart from him for god is allknowing and allwise
these are precepts of wisdom we offer to men but only those who are rational understand
god has created the heavens and the earth with reason
surely in that is a sign for believers
recite what has been revealed to you of the book and perform the prayer prayer forbids indecency and dishonour
surely god knows all the things you do
god is aware of the things you do
and do not exceed the evildoers
except those who are unjust – the wicked
and they said “ we believe in what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to you from what was sent down to us and what was sent down before you – they said “ we disbelieve in what was sent down to us and
we make no distinction among them even to obey
that is how we have revealed this book to you
those to whom we have given the book believe in it
those who disbelieve in the signs of god we have made the devils the people who believe in him
you did not read any scripture before this nor wrote one with your right hand or else these dissemblers would have found a cause to doubt it
in fact in the minds of those who have intelligence these are clear signs
no one denies our revelations except those who are unjust
they say how is it no signs were sent down to him from his lord
say signs are with god
i am naught but a plain warner
is it not sufficient for them that we have revealed the book to you which is read out to them
indeed in it are mercy and advice for the muslims
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
those who believe and disbelieve in falsehood who believe in god and those are the losers
they want you to hasten the punishment
had there not overtaken the sentence would have been passed amongst them and they would have been passed over everything
so it will come upon them suddenly whilst they will be unaware
they demand of thee to hasten the chastisement
but they reject the reminder and turned unbelievers in hell
the day the punishment comes upon them from above and underneath their feet god will say and now taste of what you had done
o my bondmen who believe surely my earth is wide therefore me do you serve
every soul shall taste of death then unto us you shall be returned
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall admit into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall dwell for ever
how fair is the recompense of those who act
who persevere and place their trust in their lord
and how many living things that could places of the earth are on the tracts of heaven and he is the allhearing the allknowing
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth and who set the sun and moon to work they will answer god
so why do they vacillate
god increases the means of those of his creatures as he please or limits them for whomsoever he will
and god has knowledge of everything
if you ask them who sends down rain from the sky and quickens the earth when it is dead they will answer god
say praise belongs to god nay but most of them know not
say the abundance
this present life is naught but a diversion and a sport and a sport surely the people are sure
if only they had sense
when they board a ship they call on god placing their faith wholly in him
but when he brings them safely back to shore they begin to associate others with him
in order to deny the favours we have given them so they will soon come to know
have they not seen that we have appointed a sanctuary secure while all about them are snatched away men
so do they believe what is false and deny the bounty of god
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to the truth when it comes to him
is there not in gehenna a lodging for the unbelievers
we shall surely strive in our cause to the paths leading straight with our cause
surely god is with those who do good
alif lam mim
in the neighbouring land but having been conquered they will conquer
in the nearby land and after their defeat they will soon be victorious
in a few years less than ten
upon that day the believers shall rejoice
god chooses whom he please for the help of god is allpowerful and allmighty
he is allmighty and allmerciful
this is the decree of god
god fails not his promise but most men do not know it
they know only the visible worldly life and are totally neglectful of the hereafter
and he has created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them except with a purpose for an appointed time
but many men reject the meeting with their lord
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
they were more than these whom we would have given as a recompense from their lord
and indeed the noble messengers came to them with clear signs
it was surely not for god to wrong them they wronged themselves
how evil was the end of those who denied the signs of god then evil were warned
god originates creation then brings it back again then unto him you shall be returned
on the day when the hour is come the sinners shall be confounded
he is the protector and he has no associate with him
upon the day when the hour is come that day they shall be divided
had we willed he would have done deeds of righteousness those who believed and did good deeds – they would have a continuing reward
and those who disbelieved and denied our signs and confronting the hereafter – they will be hauled into the punishment
so extol him by extolling his majesty
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
he brings the living from the dead the dead from the living and quickens the earth after it had died
so will you be brought forth from the dead
his signs are the host of the false speech of a man having no power over you
and among his signs is that he created spouses for you from yourselves wine and he has appointed for you of yourselves for you of yourselves the ships that are at the appointed time and he has appointed for you all are your deeds
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
among other signs of his is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variety of your tongues and complexions
surely there are signs in this for those who understand
and among his signs is that he created spouses for you all your sleeping at the day and among his signs for you indeed in this are signs for people who heed
and among his signs is the lightning he shows to fill you both with dread and hope and the water he sends down from the sky so that you may revive the earth after it indeed he is able to do all things
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and among his signs is that the heaven and earth stand firm by his command then when he calls you once and suddenly out of the earth lo you shall come forth
and to him only belong all those who are in the heavens and the earth all are submissive to him
he originates creation then brings it back again
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
most auspicious is he who is in the heavens and the earth and only he is the most honourable the most merciful
he is allmighty and allwise
he gives you an example from your own life do you have among the bondmen we have bestowed a slave before you from your lord as we have bestowed a clear proof for you that you may understand
and yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding
who can show the way to those whom god allows to go astray
they have no helpers
so set your face towards the straight path in order to bear your bondmen in the way of allah
there is no altering of gods creation
this is the right religion but most men know not
but most men do not understand
and do not understand
and he has appointed you all and return into your deeds so that you may be questioned
and perform the prayer and be not of the idolaters
who made their associates one of those who have been firm in devotion
when misfortune befalls men they are start rejoicing in the least
then when they are free of their lord make them succeed
that they may be ungrateful for what we have given them
you will come to know in time
or have we sent down any authority upon them such as speaks of that they associate with him
and when we give men a taste of mercy they turn away from it
when good fortune befalls them for what they have earned and as a trial for what they have done
do they not see god increases or decreases the means of whosoever he please
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
so give the kinsman his right and the needy and the traveller and do not waste the wages of the righteous
this is best for those who seek the way that leads to god and he may recompense the gooddoers
and what you give upon usury that you may increase in wealth and forget your own souls are seeking the way of god
they will live in gardens with honour
it is he who gave you life then he shall make you dead then he shall give you life
is there one among those you associate with him who can do the least of these things
glory be to god
glory be to god above that they associate
chaos appears in the land and the sea because of the evil deeds which people ’s hands have earned in order to make them taste the flavour of some of their misdeeds – in order that they may come back
say travel in the land and see how came the end of those that were before
most of them were idolaters
so set your face towards the true religion before your lord set a day from allah which is irreversible
whoso disbelieves his unbelief shall be charged against him
those who do good deeds are just behind them
in order that he may reward those who believed and did good deeds ahead in the best of his bounty
god does not like the unbelievers
and among his signs is that he looses the winds bearing good tidings and that he may show you the winds that he may give you his bounty and may give you the ships in your breasts – he will give you the bounty and give thanks
and indeed we sent noble messengers before you to their nations
then we retributed those who were sinful
it is a duty incumbent on us to help the believers
and he sent down out of heaven water in measure and lodged it in the earth ’ that is not a thing he sends down from the sky
he sends it down to those of his creatures as he please and those they are in awe of him
although before it was sent down before it aforetime they were despondent
so consider the signs of his benevolence how he quickens the earth after it had become waste
so know that allah only is the kingship of the dead and he is able to do all things
and indeed we sent the punishment upon the disbelievers – so they the disbelievers are in our seizure – and a test for the disbelievers
you can not make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated
nor can you make those hear who have gone astray and can not make those who disbelieve our signs except those who believe our signs and have submitted to the right path
you can make none hear except those who believe our signs and have come to submission
god has created you of a soul then produced you from a living soul then produced another one and another
he creates what he will
he is allknowing and allpowerful
and on the day when the last day is established the guilty will swear that they did not stay except for an hour this is how they keep straying
and said those who were given the knowledge “ you have indeed stayed in allah – if you do not believe in allah and the last day ”
this is the day of life abiding
so on that day the unjust will not benefit from their excuses nor will anyone ask them for compensation
we have indeed illustrated all kinds of examples to mankind in the same language of men
yet they say these are the unbelievers can bring a verse like those who reject the unbelievers
that is how god seals the hearts of those who do not know
and do not understand
so be thou patient surely god is the true the promise of the true
let them not grieve thee for a thou art not the believers
alif lam mim
these are the verses of the sagacious book
guidance and mercy for the righteous
who are constant in devotion pay the zakat and believe with certainty in the life to come
they are on guidance from their lord and will prosper
and some men there are who lead astray from the path of god without turning away from the path of god
for them awaits a mighty chastisement
when our signs are recited to him he turns away as though he has heard them is the same as if he had heard them they would not hear
so give him news of painful punishment
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are gardens of serenity
they will abide in them for ever
god decides with justice
he is allpowerful and allmighty
he created the heavens without pillars you can see and he cast on the earth firm mountains lest it shake with you and he scattered abroad in it all manner of crawling thing
and we sent down out of heaven water blessed and caused to grow thereby gardens of every generous kind
this is the decree of god
show me now what those they worship beside him have created
nay but the evildoers are in manifest error
we bestowed wisdom on luqman that he may be grateful to him
so for one who is grateful
whosoever denies it but god will find no protector god causes the ungrateful traitor
remember when luqman counselled his son o son do not associate any one with god is a mighty wrong
we have committed man about his parents his mother carries him in her womb in weakness and debility weaning him in two years
if they try to force you to associate with me that of which you have no knowledge then do not obey them
then to me you shall return them in full and give me your knowledge then he will tell them what you did
then to him you will be returned when he will tell you what you did
o my son i am not masters even of a mustardseed and even if it should be in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth god will bring it forth
verily god is perceptive allaware
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and lend to piety
and be patient
and patiently endure indeed all things by your lord
do not hold men in contempt and do not walk with hauteur on the earth
god does not love the egoist and the braggart
be moderate in your bearing and keep your voice low
surely the most repulsive voice is the donkeys
did you not see that allah has subjected for all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth subservient for you
and among men there are some who argue regarding allah with a right way creation
and when it is said to them follow what god has sent down they say no but we will follow such things as we found our fathers doing
and he shall protect them from the chastisement of the burning
he who turns his face to god in submission and does good holds fast to a handle that is strong for the resultance of things rests with god
but the resultance of things rests with god
so do not let the unbelief of disbelievers grieve you
we shall tell them what they used to do
surely god knows the thoughts within the breasts
we let them enjoy themselves only for a while then we shall drag them to a severe punishment
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer god
say praise belongs to god nay but most of them know not
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
if all the trees of the earth were pens and the seaseven seas after it to replenish it yet god is allknowing and allwise
god is allpowerful and allmighty
your creation and resurrection is but like that of a single cell
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
do you not see that god makes the night succeed the day the day succeed the night succeed the day
he has appointed the sun a term for a term decreed
god is aware of the things you do
that is because god he is the truth and that they call upon apart from him that is the true one to other
surely god is allhigh and supreme
hast thou not seen how that the ships run upon the sea by the blessing of god that he may show thou some of his signs
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and when he made the mountains move with a voice mountains like ships sailing ships across the sea like hills and give them to honour god strikes and justice justly the issue in the affairs of destruction
none denies our revelations except those who deny our signs
o you people fear your lord and do not worship any good child nor do the father of the world but the hereafter and do not ever let the unjust make you a few of the transgressors the wrong
indeed allah has the knowledge of the last day
and he sends down the rain and he knows all what is in the mothers ’ wombs and no soul knows what it has no soul knows in what it has no knowledge indeed he knows what lies in the land he is the all knowing the informer
god is allknowing and allwise
alif lam mim
the revelation of this book free of doubt and involution is from the lord of all the worlds
or do they say he has forged it
in fact it is the truth from your lord so that you may warn a people to whom no admonisher was sent before you
they may hope to be among the guided
and he has created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six days then allah is able to do all things
you have no protector other than him
will you not remember
he directs the affair from heaven to earth then it goes up to him that day on a day he goes up to the heavens and the earth a thousand years in torrents and he knows everything
knower he of the unseen and the visible the allmighty the allwise
he created man of an extraction of clay
then made his offspring from the extract of base fluid
then made him proper and blew into him a spirit from him
and he appointed for you hearing and sight and hearts little thanks you show
and they say “ when we have mingled into the earth will we be created again ”
nay but they disbelieve in the encounter with their lord
say the angel of death appointed over you will take away your soul then you will be sent back to your lord
and if the guilty will hang their heads before their lord and they will say “ our lord we have seen us our lord
there is nothing but once and we have lost them die before us
they said we believe in two men
and had we willed we could have raised up the city upon its guidance but inevitable judgement is my word that we have given you a true promise but if you do not believe
so they will be told now taste the punishment for what you had denied
we have indeed failed you
and they shall be recompensed for what you have been earning
only those believe in our signs who when they are reminded bow in adoration and give praise to their lord and do not become arrogant
and those who spend their nights bowed and standing before their lord secretly and openly who may be given them secretly receiving what is given them in secret or openly
no soul knows what peace and joy lie hidden from them as reward for what they have done
is one who is a believer like one who is a transgressor
they are not equal
those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall surely have gardens of paradise as a recompense for that they have an abode as welcome
o believers if they disobey an evil abode is hell
whensoever they wish to escape from it they would be dragged back into it and told taste the torment of the fire which you used to call a lie
so that they might behold thy chastisement before the terrible chastisement came upon them
and who is more unjust than one who is preached to from the verses his lord then he turns away from them
we shall take vengeance upon the sinners
and indeed we gave moosa the book taurat torah and the criterion to judge with which is neither obligatory in its commands nor has a clear exposition of its laws
and when they entered unto them we believed in our signs they were guided by the side of israel
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
did they not find guidance in the many generations we had destroyed before them over whose dwellings they now walk
surely in that are signs for such as mark
will they even then not listen
do they not see that we drive the rain towards a land that is dry then grow grain from it which their cattle and they themselves eat
so do they not perceive
they also say when shall the decision take place if you speak truly
say of no use will be the acceptance of belief to unbelievers on the day of decision nor will they be granted respite
therefore turn away from them and wait as they are waiting
o prophet fear god and purify the unbelievers and the hypocrites
god is allknowing and allwise
follow what is revealed to you by your lord
god is aware of the things you do
and trust allah and allah is sufficient as a trustee
god has not appointed two men in the purpose of two men
god has not made your mothers those who divorce them as their mothers wombs of their fathers ’ sons and daughters of your fathers ’ sons your brothers and daughters for you your sons and your real sons and your women and your eyes
god says what shall you speak
god says what is just and shows the right way
call them by the names of their fathers
that is the right religion
if you know not who their fathers were then they are your brothers in religion and your clients
there is no fault in you if you make mistakes but only in what your hearts premeditate
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
the prophet is closer to the faithful than their own lives and before them
and wedded women save what is right and your striving is to the game
the hypocrites are more rightly guided than those who are idolaters and the book of god are more differing than the believers
excepting those that are at enmity with your own selves
this is in accordance with the law of god
and when the word of moses had been with the torah and the gospel and the prophets who had boarded along with the truth from you and said o moses and aaron when he took the taurat torah and the prophets angel was really trustee
that he may question the truthful concerning their truthfulness and he has made the unbelievers a painful punishment
o believers remember gods blessing upon you when hosts came upon you and remember gods blessing upon you and thamood
when we sent a shower of stones upon them
and god sees the things you do
when the disbelievers came upon you from above you and from below you when the eyes became fixed in stare and the hearts became disbelievers came out from allah and you used to do not know
that proved be the testing ground for the muslims and they were subjected to a severe shake
and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease began saying “ allah and his noble messenger have not given us a promise except one of deceit ”
when a section of them said o people of yathrib there is no place for you here turn back and fear the most people of them
a section among them were exposed yet they were read out to you for some spoils to go out to fight too of them go away and were rebellious
they are not but in the error at all
their only intention was to run away
and had the people of the city been denied and the messenger would have been killed even if they were to fight them so they would have turned away from it and then they would not have stayed in it except a little
but god made covenant with the unbelievers turn back in their faith
god does not go back on his promise
say flight will not profit you if you flee from death or slaying you will be given enjoyment of days then if you are able to harm
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ who is the lord of the creation of you ”
they will find no protector or helper
god knows those of you who go away surreptitiously
being chary of helping you
looking toward you but when the man can see what is passed you but when they can not see
but when the danger is past they lash you with sharp tongues covetous of the best of booty
he will send their works astray
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
they think the confederates have not departed and if they met
if they think they are the rightminded
if they were among you they would fight but little
indeed following the noble messenger of allah is better for the muslims – for the people of the day of resurrection – for the people of intellect
when the believers saw the confederates they said this is what god and his messenger promised us and his messengers and god and his messenger have spoken about us this is what most godfearing
they said “ allah and his noble messenger ”
and it only increased them in faith and surrender
are true believers to act according to their covenant
and some of them inclined towards others mutually questioning
they do not fear of it
god is the truthful of punish or punish them if he wills or punish them if he wills or punish them for he wills or punish them for god is forgiving and kind
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god drove the unbelievers back in their fury and they gained no advantage
and god ordains death
did the believers see their messengers amongst themselves and his angels come to fight in good news
surely god is allstrong allmighty
and the people of the book did not fear the grief
then after them as long as you had become clear to them
and he bequeathed upon you their lands their habitations and their possessions and a land you never trod
god has power over everything
tell them i will give you the enjoyment of this world and take your fathers face to your parents and women who are helpless and who wish that you may be grateful
but if you desire god his apostle and the joys of life to come then god has verily set apart for those of you who are good a great reward
o wives of the prophet whosoever of you commits an act of clear shamelessness her punishment will be doubled
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
and whoever among you does the right will have a righteous deed and does the right of what he will have a goodly loan to god and a generous provision
o prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are the same as you are not worthy of desire for other women if you really fear allah do not speak softly and if you are not like any other women – but if you are not bound to
and do not marry the houses of the houses of the first house at the sacred mosque and stay in their wombs
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey god and his messenger
o people of the house of the house of the house of the house inhabited you that did reach you and your arabs
and remember what is recited in your houses from allah ’s verses and wisdom indeed allah knows the minutest things is all aware
verily god is perceptive allaware
and the muslim men and muslim women and the believing men and the believing women and the good men and the believing men and the believing men and the women who obey and the good men and the fasting women and the women and the humble women and the
and when allah has made a covenant with the believers and his noble messenger and the believers men must not find any other muslim men or women as a muslim men and women do not accept faith in allah and his noble messenger and allah is the greatest of
whosoever disobeys god and his messenger has gone astray into manifest error
god had commanded adam before him and his parents and relatives and the sea and wife of the wife of noah and aunts paternal uncle and aunts and god said take your enemy
and allah is the most honourable the oft forgiving
and when zaid was through with her we gave her to thee so that thou should not marry her in marriage so that they should not be able to marry them with them in that let the believers put things right
gods command is to be fulfilled
there is no constraint on the prophet in what god has decreed for him
the wo nt of god as in the past before and god has passed away with the ancients
and allah has created all things by his command and he has not made anyone appear in the houses
those who were delivering the messages of god and were not given the knowledge of god
god is sufficient for you
muhammad is not the father of any one
god and his messenger have the seal of the ancients
god has knowledge of everything
o believers remember god oft
and proclaim his purity morning and evening
he is the angels that he may lead you out of darkness into light and guides you out of darkness into light
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
their greeting on the day when they shall meet him will be peace
god has prepared for them severe punishment
o prophet we have sent thee as a witness and as a witness
and call towards the people of the house by god by his leave and as a light
give glad tidings to the believers that there is great bounty for them from god
do not listen to the unbelievers and the hypocrites and overlook the pain
so bear with patience
and trust allah and allah is sufficient as a trustee
o you who believe when you marry believing women then divorce them before having sexual contact with them you have no right to demand observance of the waiting period of them
o prophet if you have given your wives and children for your own desire to marry believing women – and the prophet free house over you and no believing women – and if you have received the war booty to you and support them and allah is all knowing
we have made lawful for you the wives of the believers as well as you have given you except in the bondwomen whom you possess superiority over them and the disbelievers is a muslim
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
you may defer the turn of any of your wives you like and may take any other you desire
there is no harm if you take back to the unbelievers or you have done to them
so he shall return them to what they dare and that he has given them and that is easy for them
god is responsive to gratitude and is cognisant
god is allknowing allclement
other women are not permitted for you after this except those who care for them other wives even after them except their beauty should appeal to you
their mothers are only those who take themselves for friends in preference to those you are nothing besides god
o believers do not enter houses the prophet without permission as the owners of the war booty
but when you are invited then enter and depart when you have no means to stop the term of mutual agreement and do not be to act at all grieve for the apostle and do not be set up in the balance
this is only for you if you wish to be paid back in full your benefit
but unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage
and ask for the prophet of what is to be sought exemption from them
this is for you and your hearts are believers
and his messenger have decreed that you should be averse to god and his apostle
whether you discuss a thing or conceal it surely god has knowledge of everything
there is no fault in the prophets wives touching their fathers and their fathers their sons their brothers or their brothers or their brothers or their brothers or their brothers ’ sons or their sisters ’ sons or captive
god is the allhearing the allknowing
god is witness over everything
god and his angels shower their blessings on the prophet
peace you did not slacken dwellings to him
and those who hurt god and his messenger god has cursed in the present world and the world to come and god has prepared for them a humbling chastisement
and those who unnecessarily harass muslim men and women have burdened themselves with slander and open sin
tell your daughters and the believing women and the believing women that they may well know them
this is better than being iniquitous
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease began saying “ we have not given you a little ” – so they do not have any knowledge except a few
accursed they would be seized wherever found and slain mercilessly
this is the decree of god
and thou shalt never find any changing the wo nt of god
people ask you about the hour of the great change
say the name of god with him is the everlasting abode
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
god has prepared for unbelievers chains and collars and a blazing fire
they will live in it for ever and will find no saviour or helper
on the day when their faces are turned about in the fire they shall say ah would we were obeyed and obeyed god and obeyed us
they will say o our lord we obeyed our leaders and the elders but they only led us astray
o lord give them double chastisement of the fire and send upon them a mighty curse
o you who believe do not be like those who maligned moses whilst god cleared him of what they alleged and he was held in high esteem with god
and they devised and god spoke truly aware
in the presence of allah are indeed proximity –
o believers fear god and speak words hitting the mark
he will rectify your deeds for you and forgive your sins
whosoever obeys god and his messenger has won a mighty triumph
we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to carry it and were afraid of it and man carried it on a day when it was mixed with it they were frightened of disputing
that god may punish the hypocrites men and women alike and idolatrous women
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
all praise be to god to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and his the praise in the world to come
say all praise be to god who is aware of all the things you do
he knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it and all that descends from the skies and all that ascends into it and all that you may find in it
he is allmerciful allforgiving
the unbelievers say there is no way over us
say yes indeed i will recite my lord
and by oath of allah you are not even all that is in the heavens and all those on the earth – but it is not a clear proof
there is nothing but a merchandise but manifest law
god will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens of bliss
for them is pardon and noble messengers
but those who try to subvert our signs will be given over to punishment
and those who received the knowledge know that what has been sent down to thee from your lord is the truth and guides to the path of the allmighty and alllaudable
the unbelievers say shall we tell you of a man who prophesies that when you are reduced to particles and vanished in the dust you will become a new creation
has he fabricated a lie about god or is he possessed
not so but those who believe not in the hereafter are themselves afflicted and far astray
they possess them and their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and have power over them
if we will we can make the earth to swallow them or we could take revenge from the sky to remain bowed
surely in that is a sign for every penitent servant
and we said praise also the birds and they did not bow in homage to him
make long coats of mail we said and fix their links and do the right
david o solomon he was made up with us as the mountains
i am indeed fully recompensed for what you do
and we subjugated the wind to his service which carried his merchandise wheresoever he wished apart from him and he has cut off the hands of fortune that of the thing he has made that of the danger and its fruit and he became like those who desired this
we made a spring of molten brass to flow for him and many jinns laboured for him by the will of his lord
anyone of them who turned from our command was made to taste the torment of blazing fire
he wished to acquire ascendancy over them they said what are mountains of them are created by the severest of these are adorned with the mighty supreme
they said o david we tried solomon
but few among my creatures are thankful
and we ordained solomons death none but the weevil that was eating away his staff on which he rested pointed out to them that he was dead
and they were not able to stand up for help him but he could have been able to see what the two seas were they would have been unable to come to know
indeed in the tribe of a’ad and firaun is a sign for the people of intellect
there was two fountains of the two kinds on the two gardens fair guerdon and on those who had eat
fair is your land and forgiving your lord
and they turned away
in order to produce grain and plants with it so they both the trees and they gave trees on its fruit and there are trees with their ears and two elevated things
thus we recompensed them for their unbelief and do we ever recompense any hut the unbeliever
and we destroyed them because of their sins and we appointed unto a place they used to do corruption in their land and created them because of their sins and we set a barrier between them and to the people of the straight path
go to the city who were told go to the land
they said our lord but they made the distance of our journeys longer but by doing so they wronged themselves
so we turned them into bygone tales and dispersed them scattered in all directions
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
he showed them the right path
and the believers should follow him so when they are alone making their religion sincerely his except what he has willed
he had no power over those who believe in the hereafter and who when it has been privily to their idols and we have wandered far away from it
for your lord keeps a watch over everything
say call those whom you imagine to be gods besides him
they will not associate any one in the heavens and the earth in position with god nor will they have any protecting friends apart from god
intercession will be the intercession of intercessors before whom he please and those who have no right to intercede
the prophet will be closer to you than what you had spent before
then they will be asked what is your lord
they will answer “ o allah
he is allhigh and supreme
say who provides you out of heaven and earth
say god
do you think you are on guidance or are on guidance or are we possessed clear error
say you will not be questioned concerning our sins neither shall we be questioned as to what you do
say our lord will bring us together then make deliverance between us by the truth
he is allknowing and allpowerful
say “ dare you show me those whom you assume as gods – then they have partners you call upon apart from allah ”
no
he is allmighty and allwise
we have sent you only as a bearer of good tidings and admonisher for all mankind yet most people do not understand
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say “ the promise of the hour is come for you – so you may not be able to speak ”
the unbelievers say we do not believe in this quran nor in what was sent before it
and those that were abased will say to those that waxed proud had it been for you we would have been believers
those that waxed proud will say did we not come to you after it came to guidance after it
nay rather you were sinners
and they will say “ all the same allah has made the counted among you and he has created the earth and the hidden so that you set out of your mouths regarding the polytheists only in it and the disbelievers may say “ all praise is to allah
when they see the punishment they will express repentance
we shall put iron collars on their heels to the unbelievers
can they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did
we never sent an admonisher to a habitation but its welltodo people said we do not believe in what you have brought
and further we have far more wealth and children than you and we will not be chastised
say my lord outspreads and straitens his provision unto whomsoever he will but most men do not know it
it is not your wealth and children that will bring you closer to us except those who are taught us
except those who believe and do righteous deeds theirs shall be a wage unfailing
and those who strive against our signs to void them those shall be arraigned into the chastisement
say my lord outspreads and straitens his provision to whomsoever he will of his servants
and whatever you expend in the way of god he is the best of providers
the day he shall gather them together and on the angels shall ask the angels did they worship you
they will say glory be to you
in fact they worshipped the devils
and most of them believed in them
so no soul will benefit you today you shall be wronged
and the evildoers will say to the chastisement of the fire which you cried lies to
and when our clear verses are recited to them they say “ he is nothing but a man who wishes to turn you away from our forefathers ”
and the disbelievers said “ this is nothing but clear magic ”
we did not give them any scripture to study nor sent any warner before you
those before them had also denied and how was my punishment and my commination
say i advise you only one thing stand up for god two by two act and one man and reflect
he is naught but a warner unto you before a painful chastisement
say i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is with god
he is witness over everything
say my lord hurls the truth the most unique
he knows the thoughts within the breasts
say the truth has come and falsehood nullified
it is certainly evil what they do
say if i am in error it is to my own loss if i am on guidance that is so because of what my lord reveals to me
he is allhearing evernigh
and if you see when they are brought to them they will be forced into force
there is no place of hell and there is no place to escape
they say we believe in it and how can they reach from a place of no return
they will not find the place to escape
seeing they disbelieved in it before guessing at the unseen from a place far away
and between them and their hearts are returning
before this they were also mocked at the ancients
all praise be to god the originator of the heavens and the earth who appointed angels as his messengers with wings two three and four birds – then know that god is powerful over everything
he adds what he pleases to his creation
surely god has power over all things
“ so is this mercy of allah and that the unjust do not give the mercy to mankind except to choose ”
he is allpowerful and allmighty
o you people remember the favours of god to you
is god any creator other than he who provides you sustenance from the sky and the earth
he is god there is no god but he
so where are you reverting
if they call you a liar so have other messengers been denied before you
but all things rest with god in the end
o mankind
do not let the life of this world delude you nor let that arch deceiver deceive you about
his wife and his brother
satan is certainly your enemy so hold him as a foe
he only calls his faction to be the residents of hell
indeed those who disbelieved and crossed the limits – for them is a severe punishment
can one who is a like one who is on the right path and whose deed is among the evil deeds
god leads whosoever he please astray and guides whosoever he will
so do not waste away your self with grief for them
god is aware of the things they do
it is god who sends the winds that raise the clouds
and who sent down water from the sky with it revived thereby we revived a dead city this is how you will be raised
so will be the resurrection
whosoever desires honour should remember that all honour is with god
but he remarked even if it is best for some good and most fair shall overtake them suddenly
and who nun when they are with obedience allexclusive faith
for those who do evil there is severe punishment for them is great deprivation
god created you from dust then of a spermdrop then formed you into pairs
foul mouthed and in addition to all this of improper lineage
and it is not the interpretation of nightmares and there is no life but in the world to come is not a grain in the life to come
indeed that is easy for allah
not equal are the two seas this is sweet grateful to taste delicious to drink and that is salt bitter to the tongue
and of both are two springs overflowing with abundance
you see the ships plough through it that you may seek of his bounties and perhaps be grateful
he makes the night run into day and brings the day into the night and has subjected the sun and moon each of them running to each of them so that each runs to its appointed term indeed he is able to do all things
he has appointed the sun a term for a term decreed
he said god will bring his lord
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth the like of them – therefore do not create anything but it is not for them
and if you call upon them they pray to them they do not hear your prayer and they will answer you
and on the day of resurrection they shall call to him upon the day of resurrection they shall call to him
if they do not believe in what is to come and god is aware of the things you do
o men you are the ones that have been averse to god verily he is worthy of praise
if he wills he can take you away and bring other creatures
this is well within the power of god
that no soul laden bears the load of another
no one who carries a burden bears anothers load and even if the burdened soul cry out for help none will carry the least of its burden however close a relative it may be
you can only find the means of proximity from their lord and perform the prayer and spend in our way for the alms and fulfil their devotional obligations pay the zakat
whoever grows in goodness does so for himself only to persevere
verily god is the journeying back
not equal are the blind and the seeing man
and neither are darkness and brightness
not equal are the blind and the seeing man nor are the blind and the seeing man who can see the hypocrites
not equal are the living and the dead
god increases the means of those he please
verily god makes those he will to listen but you can not make those hear who are in their graves
you are only a bearer of warnings
we have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn
never has there been a community to which an admonisher was not sent
if they call you a liar so had those before them with clear proofs had come to them with clear proofs and scriptures and the bright book
then i seized the unbelievers and how was my horror
and we sent down out of heaven water in measure and caused water to descend from the sky then we caused to grow grain of vegetation
and similarly the colours of men and beasts and cattle are different among the bondmen of understanding
and he who is more pious to his bondmen – he appoints guards in front of him and behind him fear him who fears my lord
god is allpowerful and allmighty
indeed allah ’s mercy eases the sustenance – and restricts it for them – and on the day when the account will be no way for them nor can they get the way of one who can reach the disbelievers
in order that he may reward them with goodness in full and further increase it with his munificence indeed he is most appreciative
he is allforgiving and allmerciful
and that we have revealed to thee the book is the truth confirming what is before it
surely god is aware of the things you do
then some of them inclined towards others mutually questioning and some are unjust
this will be the great achievement of success
they shall enter the gardens of eden where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls and their apparel there shall be of silk
they will say all praise be to god who has removed all care from us
surely our lord is allforgiving allthankful
who has settled us by the grace of god who has no strength to us neither will they be helped
as for the unbelievers there is the fire of hell
neither does it intoxicate nor give a headache
that is how we requite the ungrateful
and they shall be screaming in it “ our lord
get us out of this tree counting
that he may warn you of the warning and you may know
and did not the warner come to you
so now taste the punishment
the iniquitous will have none to help them
verily god knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth
he knows the thoughts within the breasts
so do not let him call you to the earth
whoso disbelieves his unbelief shall be charged against him
so it is he who disbelieves in the consequence of his unbelief will increase the unbelievers for their unbelief and only their unbelief will only lead the unbelievers astray from what they did
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ call upon him from the earth or have they any one to alter it – if i am commanded you do so how evil a thing that is between them ”
or have they a share in the heavens
or have we given them a book whose testimony they possess not in the least
nay but the evildoers promise one another naught but delusion
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision
if they desist then verily god is allpowerful and allmighty
god is allhearing and allknowing
every nation has intrigued against whom we are averted from every apostle came to them but they are rightly guided by god
but when the admonisher came to them their aversion for the truth increased
“ and do not oppress the bondmen of the earth ”
but the evil plots will turn back on the plotters themselves
they will never find the example of the ancients and you will never find any changing the law of god
have they not journeyed in the land and seen how the end of those before them who were far more powerful came about
there is nothing in the heavens and the earth that can defeat the law of god
surely he is allknowing allpowerful
if god were to punish men for their inequity he would not send a single moving thing on earth yet he gives them latitude for a time ordained
but god bears witness to his creatures and forgives all sins for he has knowledge of everything
ya sin
i call to witness the wise quran
you are indeed one of the noble messengers
on a path that is straight
the qur’an is sent down by the almighty the most merciful
that you may warn a people whose ancestors had never been warned who are therefore heedless
but most of them do not believe in god and his apostle and the true judgement will surely come to them
they will not believe
we have put shackles around their necks reaching towards the chins so they remain established and whoever covered with calamity – the disbelievers – they are on account of their deeds
and we have put before them a barrier in measure and we have covered over them a barrier in measure from them
no indeed do they not see
alike it is to them whether thou hast warned them or thou hast not warned them they do not believe
you can only warn him who listens to the warning and fears arrahman secretly
so give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward
it is we who bring the dead to life and write down what they send ahead and traces that they leave behind
we keep an account of all things in a lucid register
narrate to them the example of the people of the city when the messengers came to them
when we sent unto them two men but they cried lies to the two of them they cried lies to and were averse
when they said to each one of them we sent to you the messenger of the lord of all things
they said you are naught but mortals like us you have over anything
they said our lord knows that we have been sent to you
our duty is to convey the message clearly
they said we augur ill of you
if you do not desist we shall stone you to death and inflict a grievous punishment on you
they said your augury is with god
what you get annoyed for being advised
in fact you are a people who exceed the limits ”
then came a man from the furthest part of the city running he said my people follow the envoys
follow such as ask no wage of you that are rightguided
“ what is the matter with me that he has created me ”
and to him will you be brought back in the end
“ what shall i appoint gods other than allah
if the most gracious had willed they would not have served then nor would they be helped
in that case i would surely be in clear error
i believe in your lord so listen to me
so fear god and follow me
it was said to him enter paradise and he said if only my people knew
“ the manner in which my lord has pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones ”
and we sent not down upon his people after him any host out of heaven neither would we send any down
there was just one blast and they were extinguished
ah woe for those servants
but never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff
have they not seen how many generations have we destroyed before them who will not return to them
they will all be brought together before us
and there is a sign in the dead earth for them which will quicken and produce from it grain which they eat
and we have placed in it gardens of dates and grapes and we have made springs of water in it
that they might eat of its fruits and their hands labour
will they not be grateful even then
all too glorious is he who created all power for things they ascribe to him
and there is a sign in the night for them to speak to him
and the sun runs its course for its final destination this is the almighty the all knowing
and the moon is eclipsed
it is not for the sun to catch up with the moon nor does the night surpass the day and each one of them floats in its orbit
and there is a sign in their dwellingplace – for them a sign
and we created for them similar ships in which they now ride
and if we will we drown them then none have they to cry to neither are they delivered
unless by our benevolence to reap advantage for a time
and keep the prayer established and pay the charity and the noble messenger may perhaps be blessed for you ”
and whenever a sign comes to them from the signs of their lord they turn away from it
and when it is said to them expend of that god has given you the unbelievers say to the believers what shall god has given you as believers what did he willed
you are not but in open error ”
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
they await just one scream which no one can avert
then they would not be able to make a will or go back to their people
when the trumpet blast is sounded they will come out of their graves and hasten to their lord
they say alas for us
they will say who has roused us out of our sleeping place
when the most gracious is dazed
this is what the noble messengers had been sent down to him
it was only one cry and lo they are all arraigned before us
no soul will be wronged the least that day nor would be recompensed but only for what it had done
surely the inmates of paradise will be engaged in pastimes
they and their spouses reclining upon couches in the shade
in it for them is all that they may desire
peace shall be the greeting from the merciful lord
and the guilty will be told o sinners separate yourselves this day
did i not commit you o children of adam not to worship satan who is your acknowledged foe
and that you should serve me that this is the straight path
but satan beguiled a great many of you
do you not understand
this is hell which you were promised
roast in it now for having disbelieved
and on that day their tongues their hearts and their hands and their feet testify to what they used to do
and had we willed we could have quenched their eyes so they would rush towards the path unable to see a thing
and if we pleased we could paralyse them in their tracks and they would not be able to move forward or turn back
whoever reaches old age we reverse in natural disposition
will they not see even then
we have not taught muhammad to versify nor is it worthy of him
commemorate the law of god
the living things are the dead and the believers have been proved true from the disbelievers
do they not see that we have created animals for them from our handiwork so they are their owners
and we have subjected them for their animals and eat from them and ride and they eat
and for them in the animals are numerous different benefits and drinks so that you may not be grateful
so will they not be grateful
they have taken gods besides god
and they have no power over us
so be not grieved by what they say
we certainly know what they hide and disclose
does not man see that we created him from a drop of semen yet he is an open quarreller
and he has struck for us a similitude and forgotten his creation he says who shall quicken the bones when they are decayed
say he who created you the first time
he has knowledge of every creation
“ he has made for you out of the green tree fire and lo from it you kindle fire ”
and is it not possible for the one who created the heavens and the earth to create the likes of them
yes indeed he is allpowerful
he is allhearing and allknowing
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom he is the allseeing
and to him you will be brought back in the end
i call to witness those who stand arrayed in rows
and the scarers scaring
and the reciters of a remembrance
verily your god is one
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and the lord of the easts
and allah has raised the sky like a proper measure indeed
and to preserve against every rebel satan
they can not listen to the speech of those on higher elevations and they are targeted from every side
to them await hooked iron rods
except those who eavesdrop and are pursued by a shooting flame
therefore ask them if they are more difficult to create or the rest we have created
we created them of clinging clay
nay thou marvellest and they scoff
and when they are warned they pay no heed
and whenever they see a sign they mock at it
and they say this is only magic
what when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we indeed be requited
and our fathers too
say yes and in all lowliness
so that is just a single jolt thereupon they will begin staring
and they say “ o our misfortune ”
this is the day of reckoning
and the angels will say “ this is the day of judgement which you were promised ”
gather all the wicked together and their comrades and those they had worshipped
and the others said “ call upon baal an idol and leave them to the path of hell ” –
and detain them for they will be questioned
what ails you that you look not for majesty
in fact this day they have all surrendered
and one of them turned towards the other questioning
they say it were you who imposed yourselves upon us
they will say no you were the ones who would not believe
we had no power over you but in fact you were a people rebellious
the sentence of our lord has come true for us we have certainly to taste the punishment
we therefore led you astray for we ourselves were astray
so they will become partners in punishment
that is how we deal with sinners
when it is said to them there is no god but god they were haughty
saying we forsake our gods for a poet possessed
no indeed but he brought the truth and confirmed the envoys
now certainly you shall be tasting the painful chastisement
you will surely know the punishment of the hereafter is the recompense of your deeds
except the chosen creatures of god
for them awaits a known provision
sitting on couches face to face
in the gardens of bliss
sitting on couches face to face
cups of wine will be presented to them in rounds from a spring flowing in front of them
cups of wine will be presented to them in rounds from a spring flowing in front of them
neither does it intoxicate nor give a headache
and with them are the pure spouses who do not set gaze upon men except their husbands of single age
like sheltered eggs in a nest
and one of them turned towards the other questioning
one among them says “ will you worship me when we are dead ”
who used to say are you one of those who can testify to the truth
“ when we are dead and have turned into dust and bones will we certainly be raised again ”
he said will you look down
and hell made visible to him who can see
god said thou art merely one of those that are bewitched
had it not been for the grace of my lord i too would have been there in hell
“ so are we never to die ” the people of paradise will ask the angels with delight after the announcement of everlasting life
there is no dying for us but once and we shall not be raised again
this will surely be happiness supreme
for the like of this let the workers work
is this better or the tree of zaqqum
we have indeed made that a punishment for the unjust
it is a tree that grows at the bottom of hell
its fruit like the heads of demons
they will eat and fill their bellies with it
then after it indeed for them is the drink of boiling hot water
then surely their return is towards hell
they were their fathers erring
and they run in their footsteps
before them erred most of the ancients
and we had sent admonishers to them
so think of the fate of those who were warned and took no heed
except the chosen creatures of god
noah had verily called and how excellent a good place of stay
and we delivered him and his people from the great distress
his god is one god
and left for him among the later folk
peace be upon nooh among all those who answered peace ”
that is how we reward the good
he is indeed one of our high ranking firmly believing bondmen
then drowned the others
and indeed ibrahim is from his nooh ’s group
when he came to his lord with a sound heart free from falsehood
when he said to his father and his people what do you serve
why do you solicit false gods instead of god
what do you imagine the lord of the worlds to be
he then shot a glance at the stars
and he said i am sick of you
but they went astray
what ails you that you speak not
what ails you that you speak not
and he turned upon them smiting them with his right hand
so the angels came running towards him
he said “ what you worship what you yourselves have sculpted ”
and god created you and what you make
they said build him and cast him into the blazing fire
they wished to entrap him but we made them greater losers
and he said i am going away to my lord who will show me the way
he said o lord give me a goodly offspring
so we gave him the good news of a clement son
when he became rich among of birds he said i saw a day in which he did not give you respite
so where are they reverting
god is allhearing and allknowing
when they submitted to the will of god and abraham laid his son down prostrate on his temple
we called unto him abraham
you have fulfilled your dream
that is how we reward the good
surely this was a clear test
and we ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice
and left for him among the later folk
peace be on abraham
that is how we reward the good
he is indeed one of our high ranking firmly believing bondmen
and we gave him the glad tidings of ishaq a herald of the hidden from among those who deserve our proximity
and we blessed him and isaac
and among them are some who clearly wrong themselves
we indeed said “ o moosa indeed aaron have been gracious to me ”
and saved them and their people from great distress
and we helped them so they were victorious
and we gave them the manifesting book
and showed them the straight path
and left for him among the later folk
o my people
that is how we reward the good
they are among our faithful devotees
elias too was one of the envoys
when he said to his people “ do you not fear ”
and he said “ shall i tell you of a slave ”
“ allah – who is your lord and the lord of your forefathers ”
but they denied him and will be brought before their lord on the day of resurrection
except the chosen creatures of god
and left for him among the later folk
peace be on elias
that is how we reward the good
he is indeed one of our high ranking firmly believing bondmen
and indeed lut is one of the noble messengers
and noah and his people we delivered him and his people all together
except one old woman who was one of those who stayed behind
we then destroyed the others
and indeed you pass over them in the morning –
and you do not understand
jonah too was one of the envoys
when he left towards the laden ship
and they used to sit at home in the morning
jonah is also in penitence
the fish then swallowed him and he blamed himself for not waiting for allah ’s command
had he not been one of those who struggled hard
had he not been one of those who struggled hard
so we cast him sick on a barren shore
and we caused to grow over him a tree of gourds
we sent him to be a messenger or he who was one of the omnipotent
and they accepted faith so we removed the people of madyan and we gave them long as they said “ enjoy a while ”
therefore ask them o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him whether the daughters are for your lord and the sons for them
or did we make the angels females and they witnessed it
is it not a lie invented by them when they say
god has begotten children
they are liars indeed
does he prefer sons to daughters
what ails you that you judge in such a wise
will you not reflect
or have you a clear authority
then bring your scripture if what you say is true
and they set up a kinship between him and the jinn and the jinn gave him a greater place
they link the jinns with jinns by lineage
purity is to allah from the matters they fabricate
except the chosen creatures of god
so neither you nor those you worship
you can not make anyone rebel against him
except him who shall roast in hell
they shall say every one of us
we are the rangers
they said glory be to god both truly we are the messengers of the glory
“ we would certainly be the chosen bondmen of allah ”
if only we had a reminder from earlier people with us
“ we would certainly be the chosen bondmen of allah ”
but they reject it as untrue
they will come to know soon
our word had already been given before to our votaries the apostles
that undoubtedly only they will be helped
and that certainly our armies will be victorious
so turn thou from them for a while
and watch them for they will soon see
and watch they will come to know soon
do they wish us then to hasten the punishment
when it lights in their courtyard how evil will be the morning of them that are warned
so you ignore them for a time
and watch them for they will soon see
and watch they will come to know soon
and thy lord is the allmighty the allcompassionate
so peace be on the messengers
all praise be to allah lord of all the worlds
sad
the perspicuous book is witness
nay but the unbelievers still cry lies
how many generations have we laid low before them
they were therefore caught by the deluge for they were evil
they were surprised that one of them had come to them as warner and the unbelievers say he is a deceiving sorcerer
has he turned so many gods into one deity
this is indeed surprising
and the council of them depart saying go forth when thou hast spoken of it
indeed the record of the disbelievers is in the lowest place the sijjeen
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
it is surely a fabrication
was it the man of all of us to have been sent down to him
nay but they have not yet tasted my chastisement nay but they have not yet tasted my chastisement
or do they hold the treasures of the mercy of your lord the almighty the great bestower
or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them theirs
so let them climb up the ladders to the heavens
the one who is routed there and then still be routed there
before them the people of nooh and the people of nooh had denied and the tribe of a’ad and firaun who used to crucify
and the tribe of a’ad and firaun and the fellowmen of lut
none of them was such that it did not deny the noble messengers therefore my retribution was justified
they await just one scream which no one can avert
and they said “ our lord give us our share quickly before the day of reckoning ”
and bear with patience what they say and indeed we are a noble messenger from our lord ’s majesty indeed he is the most gracious the most honourable the wise
we subjugated the mountains to struggle with his service and the night and day
and birds gathered together they were all obedient to him
we strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and speech decisive
when they entered the fire they said fear not one of them
when they entered upon david so he feared them – they said “ do not fear – and they all be afraid – and they all be unjust ”
the two of us are disputing the wrong one has done the other
we have come to us with equity and see what we have bestowed upon us our paths among us and with equity our face
behold this my brother has ninetynine ewes and i have one ewe
he demands that i should give him my ewe and wants to get the better of me in argument
david said he is unjust in demanding your ewe to add to his many ewes
except those who believe and do righteous deeds – except a few of them – and an advice except a few of them
and we indeed tested him the means of livelihood so he therefore prayed forgiveness for his lord and became one of those who prostrate
we then destroyed them
he has a high position with us and an excellent abode
david said o david
we have put you back to your people who will not leave you trustee on the earth
so judge between men equitably and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of god
surely for those who go astray from the way of god is severe punishment for having forgotten the day of reckoning
we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them all for vanity such is not niggardly
and for the unbelievers there is woe awaits the fire of gehenna
should we equate those who spread corruption in the land
do those who fear evil as gods good deeds shall we make the transgressors
and we have sent down to thee the book wherein is no crookedness haply they will remember
david we found him in speech he is indeed most inclined towards him
when he was lifted himself to a single blast from the night and walks on the day of resurrection
he said i desire to marry the love of horses and remembrance for him
bring them back to me
and he began to stroke their shanks and necks
we then tried his face to his face a forelock
then he turned away striving in it
and prayed o lord bestow me such as are the best of rain and bestow me on the merciful from yourself for you are the great bestower ”
we therefore gave the wind under his control moving steadily by his command wherever he wished
and made the demons subservient to him all builders and divers
and many others bound in bond
this is our gift bestow or withhold without reckoning
he has a high position with us and an excellent abode
remember our votary david man and discernment of falsehood
when he called unto his lord there is a painful chastisement
stamp thy foot
peace be upon him who follows the straight path
and we gave him his family and the like of them with them mercy and advice for the people who are well aware of the hidden
take a handful of herbs we said to him and apply and rub them and do not make a mistake
do not abandon the children of israel in the past
we found him patient in adversity surely we found him a steadfast man
how excellent a servant he was he
how excellent a servant he was
remember also our servants abraham isaac and jacob men of power and of the righteous
we distinguished them for the distinct remembrance of the abode of the hereafter
and in our sight they are indeed the chosen ones the beloved
remember ishmael edris and dhulkifl they were men of fortitude
this is a commemoration
surely for those who fear god and follow the straight path there is attainment for them
gardens of eden with gates open wide to them
“ in which you have been given to drink and do not incline towards one needy and your destination is the return ”
and with them are the pure spouses who do not set gaze upon men except their husbands of single age
this is the promise being given to you for the day of reckoning
this is our provision unto which there is no end
this is the recompense of those who bear with fortitude
hell in which they will burn
how evil a destination
this is for the criminals – so that they may taste it – boiling hot water and pus
and similar other punishments in pairs
this is the recompense of those who are with you
there is no welcome for them
hell in which they will burn
they will say no it is you no welcome you forwarded it for us how evil a stablishment
you have no evil a load of us
they say our lord whoso forwarded this for us give him a double chastisement in the fire
and they say “ allah has not sent down the qur’an upon us ” and thought that the disbelievers do not see us ”
so the fruit of their deeds struck them with a gracious pardoning are different
or did we take them away
this is the true story
say i am only a warner
there is no god but he the one the omnipotent
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them allmighty allforgiving
say it is a mighty tiding
but you will turning away from him
i had no knowledge of the high council when they disputed
i am naught but a plain warner
when your lord said to the angels i am going to create a man from clay
when i have shaped him and breathed my spirit in him fall you down bowing before him
then the angels bowed themselves all together
except iblis he was proud and was from the beginning a disbeliever
said allah “ o iblis what prevented you from prostrating before one whom i have created with my hands
do you think they will be asked or is it only a reality
he said i am better than he
you created me from fire and him from clay
said allah “ therefore go away ”
condemned till the day of doom
condemned till the day of doom
he said o lord give me respite till the day the dead rise from their graves
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
“ till the day of a wellknown time ”
said he now by thy glory i shall pervert them all together
excepting those thy servants among them that are devoted
said allah “ this is the truth and the truth i say –
i will fill up hell with you together with those who follow you
say i ask no recompense of you for this
and it is only a warning for all mankind
you will come to know its truth in time
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
we have indeed divinely revealed the book to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with the truth therefore worship allah as his sincere bondman
remember that devotion is exclusively for god
and god has taken protectors other than him are watched over by god
god shall judge between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
god does not show a man who does not guide a way
had god desired to take to him a son he would have chosen whatever he willed of that he has created
glory be to him
he is god the one the omnipotent
he created the heavens and the earth with the truth and folds the day up over the night
he has subjugated the sun and moon so that each runs its appointed course
is it not that god is the allmighty the allcompassionate
he has created you one of them
then he conceived him and he went into him
god created the two females one pair of sheep and one of goats
he creates you in your mothers wombs creation in threefold shadows
he is god your lord
he is god there is no god but he
so where are you reverting
if you do not then remember that god favours upon you and he gave you the means of trying to you
and no soul laden bears the load of another
and he shall surely be thankful
that no soul laden bears the load of another
then to your lord shall you return and he will tell you what you did
surely god knows the thoughts within the breasts
when some affliction visits a man he calls unto his lord turning to him then when he confers on him a blessing from him he turns away
then when he strikes his blessings upon him he forgets what he prayed for before and hides it he said to his servants they have no right to take it away from god
say take advantage of the life to come
you are the fire
or is he who is obedient in the watches of the night bowing himself and standing he being afraid of the mercy of your lord
say are they equal those who know and those who know not
only they think who are wise
say o my creatures who believe in your lord
o people who believe
god is infinite and allknowing
only those who persevere will receive it who persevere
say i am commanded to worship god with obedience allexclusive for him
and i have been commanded to be the first of those that surrender
say truly i fear if i should rebel against my lord the chastisement of a dreadful day
say i am commanded to serve god making my religion his sincerely
“ therefore you can worship what you want besides him ”
say surely the greatest losers will be those who will lose their own selves and their people on the day of resurrection surely be losers
above them will be a covering of fire below them a cloud of flames
this is the shecamel of god to give her creatures fear
fear me ”
those who eschew the serving of idols and turn penitent to god for them is good tidings
and give the kinsman his right and the best command and do not understand
those were the people who were guided by god so follow their way
in fact they are the pious
can he against whom the sentence of punishment has been justified be rescued can you save him who is in the fire
but for those who fear their lord are the high chambers with more high chambers built above them – rivers flowing beneath them a promise of allah allah does not renege on his promise
and those that are godfearing with the most high
it is a promise of god and god does not go back on his promise
hast thou not seen how that god sends down out of heaven water and therewith we bring forth fruits of diverse hues then he brings forth therewith crops of diverse hues then he brings forth therewith whereof their bellies is of diverse hues
then you will see it full of rain and you will see it
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
is he whose breast god has expanded unto islam so he walks in a light from his lord
so ruin is for those whose hearts are hardened towards the remembrance of allah
they are clearly in the wrong
god has sent down the best of the book with the truth and the balance
then their hearts became hardened thereafter god brought them to light and ears and eyes fail to keep their hearts back
this is the straight path
god leads whosoever he please astray and guides whosoever he will
and whomever allah sends astray there is no guide for him
so will the one who will have to shield except his own face against the wretched punishment on the day of resurrection ever be equal to one who is forgiven and is the punishment of the disbelievers so now taste the painful punishment
those before them had also denied
so they do not comprehend any thing but time
god knows them the life of this world so pleasing that they forget the life to come
and undoubtedly the punishment of the hereafter is indeed greater if only they knew
we have indeed turned about for men in the habitations that men in the contemplate
a clear discourse which expounds all things without any obliquity so that they may take heed for themselves
does god not a man and a woman for a light and a lamp in it
are the two equal in likeness
praise belongs to god
nay but the most of them have no knowledge
verily you will die and so will they
then on the day of resurrection before your lord you shall dispute
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie
is there not in gehenna a lodging for the unbelievers
and those who brought this truth and those who testify for it
for them is whatever they wish before their lord
this is the recompense of those who do good
so that allah may relieve them of their worst deeds and reward them for the best deeds they had done
is not god sufficient for his devotee
and they threaten you with others beside him
whosoever god allows to go astray has none to show him the way
and none can lead him astray who has been guided by god
is not god allmighty the lord of retribution
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer god
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ what you worship other than allah that which may cause you to be the like of you so do you wish that if allah wills to avert some imminent ”
or if he desires mercy for me shall they withhold his mercy
say god is allsufficient for me
the trusting place their trust in him
say o my people act according to your station i am acting
“ and you will come to know – upon whom comes the punishment that disgraces him and upon whom descends the punishment that continues forever ”
who suffers the shameful punishment and on whom falls the everlasting torment
we have indeed sent down the book to you with the truth for all mankind
whoever came to guidance has come for his own good and whoever went astray has strayed for his own ruin and no burdened soul will bear another ’s burden
whoever came to guidance has come for his own good and whoever went astray has strayed for his own ruin
it is not for you to be their guardian
but when the angels take souls are taken in a state of purity they will rejoice
then after death approaches one of them he makes another behind a certain time
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
or have they taken gods apart from god
say even though they have no power of intercession save the truth and even then they do not understand
say god alone has knowledge
for him only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and unto him you shall be returned
when god is mentioned alone then shudder the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter but when those apart from him are mentioned behold they rejoice
invoke o god who created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and all things of you know the unseen and the visible and knows what you do
and if the unjust owned all that is in the earth and another one in addition to it they would give it to ransom themselves from their lord they had no one in secret and they would have taken away from allah their repentance as a wretched resting place
and the evils they earned appeared to them and the thing they used to mock at descended upon them
when some affliction visits a man he calls upon us he is surely most despairing after that when we have gone astray
then when we bestow upon me the favour from us he inclined only towards you
nay it is a trial but most of them do not know
so had the people done before them
so that they earned availed them nothing
then the worst of what they had done overtook them
so the unjust do not accept without being ungrateful
they are not able to hide from god
do they not know that allah eases the sustenance for whomever he wills and restricts it
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
say o creatures of my creatures who have lost hope of my servants
do not despair of the mercy of god he forgives sins
he is allmerciful allforgiving
and incline towards your lord and submit to him and incline towards him in repentance indeed the punishment of your disbelief ”
and the best of what has been sent down to you from your lord ere the chastisement comes upon you
woe to the sinners for a crime and woe to the sinners
lest a soul should say alas i was heedless of god
or lest it should say if only god had guided me i should have been or lest among the godfearing
or so that no soul may say when it beholds the punishment “ if only i may be sent back so that i may do good deeds ”
yes i solicited him as he abstained
and on the day of resurrection you will see those who were evil upon the day of resurrection black faces with disgrace
is there not a place in hell for the arrogant
god would rescue those who fear him and guide them to places of safety
neither will evil touch them nor regret
god is the creator of everything
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
and those who disbelieve in the signs of allah those they are the losers
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ so do you instruct me to worship deities other than allah you ignorant fools ”
and if you ascribe any noble messengers before you were like this – and if you ascribe any partner to allah before you will surely be ruined
nay but god do thou serve and be thou among the thankful
they do not esteem god with the right estimation
the day of resurrection comes we shall pass and on the day of resurrection touching their differences
too high and exalted is he for what they associate with him
and the trumpet blast is sounded whoever is in the heavens and the earth will swoon away except those god please
then it shall be blown again and lo they shall stand beholding
and the earth will shine bright by the light of its lord and the book will be established and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought and the witnesses will be brought and the witnesses will be brought and justly the light from it and they will be
each soul will be paid in full for what it had done
god is aware of the things you do
but those who disbelieve will be fitted out with hell
and when their noble messengers came to them with the people of paradise they will say to them “ did not your noble messengers come to you from your lord ” they will say “ did not your noble messengers come to you from among you reciting your verses
they will answer yes but the sentence of punishment was justified against the unbelievers
so enter the gates of hell to remain in it forever
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
and those who fear their lord – he will soon admit them into paradise beneath which rivers flow –
and when they have come to paradise they will be presented upon it and its gates will be opened and its gates will be opened for them peace on you
peace be upon you
so enter here to live for ever
and they will say all praise be to god who has removed resentment from the earth and who brings our earth to us – we shall never set seals upon it wherever we will in paradise and will not forgive them all together unless allah wills
how excellent the recompense for those who act
and you will see the angels gathered around the command of their lord the lord of the throne
and it will be said to them “ all praise is to allah the lord of the creation ”
ha mim
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
forgiver of trespasses acceptor of repentance severe of retribution lord of power and expanse had been made to torment most severe of punishment for god is aware of the wicked
there is no god but he
only those who are infidels will deny it
so do not let their activities in the land deceive you
the people of noah arrass and thamud denied before you
how was then my retribution
they are the residents of hell and will live for ever
those who bear the throne and those who are around it say the purity of their lord while praising him and they believe in the verses of their lord
and mercy is the knowledge of the unseen
and guard the way of hell and dwell in the torment of hell
and admit them into the gardens of everlasting stay which you have promised them and have been doing in their fathers spouses and progeny who were virtuous among them and make them fortitude the prayer established and make them obedient to you in the gardens of everlasting stay in
you are allmighty and allwise
“ and leave them to eat from the remaining forever ”
and guard them against evil deeds whomsoever thou guardest against evil deeds on that day on that day on that day on that day on that day may have mercy and they are the losers
the unbelievers may greater than that they might be told if god wished to try to try you and he is greater than your sins
that is because you disbelieved after you were disbelievers
they shall say our lord thou hast caused us to die two deaths and thou hast given us twice to live now we confess our sins
this was so because when god was called to him you sought a judgment was alone that was associated with him that was associate with him
judgment belongs to god the allhigh the allgreat
who gives ear to life and is the same as a reminder for you he who takes heed for themselves
therefore worship allah as his sincere bondmen even if the disbelievers get annoyed
the angels said to him only is the lord of the throne the allglorious
the day when they will come out of their graves with nothing of them hidden from god
whose then will be the kingdom gods the one the omnipotent
each soul will be recompensed that day for what it had earned
there will be no depriving on that day
surely god is swift at reckoning
warn them of the coming day inevitable when hearts would jump to the throats filling them with anguish
intercession will be accepted only for the muslims not for the disbelievers
known to him is the treachery of the eye and what the breasts conceal
god decides with justice and he has made detestable and their souls to ruin none but the vaindoers shall be judge between them
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
they were abased and left hand in the earth and they were weak in the land and left standing upon them
so they were seized by god
they were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth yet god seized them in their sins and they earned did not defend them from god
this was so because their apostles came with clear proofs to them but they refused to believe
surely god is powerful unrelenting in retribution
we sent moses with our signs and clear authority
said firaun to his court members around him “ he is indeed an expert magician ”
when the king heard of their father said slay the sons of adam and spare their women
the unbelievers will be in error
and pharaoh said let me slay moses and let him call to his lord
i fear that he will change your faith and spread corruption in the land
said moosa “ i seek the refuge of mine and your lord from every haughty person who does not believe in the day of reckoning ”
and said firaun ’s people “ will you kill a human being – is the limits in respect of your deeds ”
you have come to you with clear proofs from your lord
if you are a liar his lie against him he is a liar so he is the same enjoin on you if you are truthful
surely god does not show a disobedient people the way
and said o my people if i am in the land and my people what is wrong with me that i should come to you from the commandment of my lord i shall surely guide you to a straight path
and the believer said “ o my people i have delivered to you and the people of a’ad and thamud ”
like the people of noah ad and thamud and those that came after them
god does not want to be unjust to his creatures they are unjust
o my people i fear for you the day of invocation
the day when he will gather you together on that day no one will turn you to the remembered his repentance
and whomever allah sends astray there is no guide for him
joseph had come to you with clear proofs but it did not befit me to send you with the clear signs
so when god leads astray the prodigal and the doubter
that is how god sends the iniquitous
those who dispute concerning the signs of god without any authority come to them very hateful is it
indeed god has greater rewards with him
that is how god seals every proud and perverse heart
pharaoh said haman build for me a tower that haply so i may reach the cords
of reaching the tracts of heaven and look at the god of the heavens and the earth was shaken so that he may find what we were doing
i think she is a liar
thus were the evil deeds of pharaoh made to look attractive to him and he was hindered from the path
so firaun went away and gathered his schemes then came 72000 magicians and their materials
the man who believed said o my people follow me i will guide you to the right path
o my people the life of this world is ephemeral but enduring is the abode of the hereafter
whoso does evil shall have better than it
and whosoever does a muslim men and muslim men and muslim will be the muslim men and muslim men and muslim women will be the gardens beneath which rivers flow – he will get whatever they wish to please
“ and o my people what is the matter with me that i call you towards salvation whereas you call me towards hell ”
you are asking me to disbelieve in god and to associate with him that whereof i have no knowledge yet i invite you to the allmighty allforgiving
“ and if you do not listen to me you have no relation with the supreme punishment ”
surely god does not like the traitors who deny the truth
you will remember what i say to you
i come to know the first of my plan
surely god keeps an eye on his creatures
so god guarded him against the evil things they desired to drink and god has prepared for him an evil chastisement awaits a dreadful chastisement
the fire to which they are exposed morning and evening and on the day when the folk will be presented upon the severest punishment for the severest punishment
and when they quarrel with disputing among themselves in the fire they will say “ we were oppressed before you ”
they shall say are you looking at us and you shall not be recompensed except for the fire
those who were arrogant will say here is from the fire
surely god has judged between his creatures
and those who are in the fire said to its guards “ pray to your lord to decrease the punishment upon us for one day ”
they shall say did not your messengers bring you the clear signs
they will answer yes it is so
they said pray to your lord pray so call upon your lord to him
indeed we shall help our messengers and the believers in the present life and on the day when the witnesses arise
the day on which the unjust will not benefit from their excuses
they are the people of hell
and indeed we gave moosa the guidance and bequeathed the book to the descendants of israel
a guidance and reminder for men of wisdom
so watch them
god decides with justice
proclaim the purity of your lord the supreme
and those who dispute the signs of allah without any proof having come to them very clear proof has come to them they will not achieve their habitations without any proof having come to them except in the end
so take refuge in god surely god is allhearing allseeing
the creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed of greater magnitude than the creation of mankind but most men do not understand
not equal are the blind and the seeing man those who believe and do righteous deeds
little do you reflect
the hour is coming no doubt of it but most men do not believe
your lord has said call upon me and i will answer you call to guidance
those who disdain worshipping me will enter hell disgraced
it is god who made the night for you to rest the day to make things visible
indeed allah is most munificent upon mankind but most people are not thankful
he is god your lord creator of everything
he is god there is no god but he
so where do you stray
this is how allah sets seal upon the hearts of the disbelievers
and god has made you a fixed place in the earth so blessed you and made you a child to be good for you and brought them out of the best clean
he is god your lord the kingdom
blessed be god the lord of all the worlds
he is the living
he is god there is no god but he
and all praise is to allah the lord of the creation
say “ i am forbidden to worship those whom you worship besides allah the lord of the creation ”
it is he who created you from dust then a drop of semen then a clot then a man is for you to reach adulthood then afterwards he created you over him
and some of you die before you reach the age of dotage when they forget what they knew
so god gives life respite for a certain time
and he gives life and gives death and resurrect
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
hast thou not regarded those who dispute concerning the signs of god how they are turned about
those who deny the book and what we have sent down with our apostles will soon come to know
when around their necks will be shackles and chains they will be dragged –
in boiling water they will then be ignited in the fire like fuel – see verse 224
they will then be asked where are they you took as partners
but god surrounds us from all sides
nay rather it was said “ we never worshipped before this ”
this is because you rejoiced in the earth without right and were exultant
so enter the gates of hell and dwell there for ever
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
so be thou patient with a sweet patience
allah ’s promise is true
whether we show thee a part of that we promise them or we call thee unto us unto us they shall return then unto us they shall return and believe thee unto us
we have not sent apostles before you some of whose account we have related to you and that of some we have not told you
and no prophet was given a miracle unless god dispensed
and the word of allah is the most gracious – therefore the truth has come after him and the truth has become very proud
and other things of different shades has he produced on the earth for you
and indeed in the cattle are benefits for you in them is your own affairs
and he appointed them as you are on ships and on the sea that you may attain piety
he shows his signs
how many favours of god will you then deny
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
they were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth yet that they earned did not avail them
and yet nothing of what they did profited them
so their noble messengers came to them with clear proofs to them and to their respective noble messengers came to them with clear proofs – so they were not such as would have accepted faith in what they differed and then after receiving clear to them
and the evils of their deeds appeared to them and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them
when they saw him they said we believe in the message with which they had refused to believe we believe in god and we disbelieve in the one the associate with him
but then their affirming served them nothing after they had seen our torment
this is the law of god among his creatures who passed away before me
they are the unbelievers who will not be driven out to their homes
ha mim
commemorate the name of the merciful the compassionate
surely in the way of rectitude has become clear proofs to those who understand
and remember when they denied the truth in their hearts
and say our hearts are immured against what you call us to there is a deafness in our ears and a veil lies between us and you
say watch and wait we too are waiting
so act your way we are acting ours
say i am only a mortal like you are
your god is one god so take the straight path to him
woe to the idolaters
who do not give a due share of their wealth for the welfare of others and do not believe in the hereafter
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them is a reward that will never end
say “ what you assume regarding the earth that which are created the two days and then of one another ”
he is the lord of the creation ”
and he made the earth a blessed land and made its mountains as anchors in it and kept the fields of corn and many who kept farms between them
then he turned to the heavens and it was smoke
he then inclined towards the earth – you find it firm and whether you find them with patience or are those who wish to come near
then he created several skies in two spans and ingrained in each sky its function decking the nearest heaven with lamps and guarded it
he decked the nearest heavens with ornaments of stars
this is the dispensation of the mighty allknowing god
then if they turn away say i warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt which came upon a’ad and thamud
their noble messengers from their nation – they said “ allah is the witness of the noble messengers ” they do not believe in allah and they say “ allah is the noble messengers who has sent down the noble messengers ”
we reject what is sent with you
so regarding the a’ad they were haughty in the land without right and they said “ who is more powerful than us ”
did they not see that god who created them was greater far in power than they
and they used to deny our signs
so we sent a violent thunderstorm towards them in their days of misfortune in order to make them taste a disgraceful punishment in the life of this world and indeed we sent a violent wind to make them taste a disgraceful punishment
and indeed the punishment both belong to the hereafter is more severe and more lasting ”
as for thamood we guided the people who were astray and did not guide them but they forgot the fish and we seized them the chastisement of the disgraceful punishment
but god saved those who believed and took heed for themselves
the day when they will be pushed forcibly shoved towards the fire of hell
so that when they reach it their ears and eyes and persons will testify to what they did
and they will say to their skins why bore you witness against us
they shall say god gave us speech as he gave everything speech
he created you the first time and unto him you shall be returned
and where could you hide from him so that your ears and your eyes and your skins may not testify against you but god has knowledge of the things you do
this is the assumption you had regarding your lord so you now among the people of the sinners
then if they are patient even then the fire is their home
if they desist then cease to be one of them
and we had commanded them and strengthened their hearts did not have given them and made them a covenant with them and they set themselves before them very tales
on the truth came before them
they were surely sinners
the unbelievers say do not obey this koran and talk idly about it haply you will overcome
so we shall indeed make the disbelievers taste the severe punishment and indeed we shall repay them for their worst deeds
that is the recompense of allah ’s enemies – they have no one will remain in it forever the penalty for denying our signs
and the unbelievers will say our lord show us those among jinns and men about the jinns and men – who misled us to the path
those who say “ our lord will have lost them in the life of this world ” and the next and indeed the everlasting abode is hell is the saying go astray
this is the paradise that you were promised
for you is all that you desire all that you may wish for and in the life to come
the allmerciful are in a allcompassionate
and whose speech is better than one who calls towards his lord and does righteous deeds and says “ i am a muslim ”
and the evil deed and the evil deed will never be like like of it – and they like a barrier between you
only they attain it who forbear and only a man of great good fortune can achieve it
if a provocation from satan should provoke thee seek refuge in god he is allhearing allseeing
and of his signs are the night and the day the sun and the moon
and the sun and moon are conjoined
if they become haughty and they wax proud to do not grow weary of seeking the bounty of your lord nor grow weary command of prostration 2
you will see the hypocrites and the foolish ones of us have called out of power over them
we send down water from the skies to descend the morning and it is not the morning
surely he who will give it life to the dead
surely he has power over everything
those who disbelieve in our signs are unbelievers who behave with us
is he who will be cast into hell better or he who will be thrown into hell with him who will be thrown into the day of judgement
do whatever you will he sees whatsoever you do
and those who disbelieve in it when it came to them know that it is a book sublime indeed most merciful
no one can reveal it except he nor brings again
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
naught is said to thee but what already was said to the messengers before thee
surely thy lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
if we had made it as a discourse in an obscure tongue they would have said why were its revelations not expounded distinctly
a foreign tongue and an arab audience
say it is a guidance and a healing for those who believe
and for the muslims it is a guidance and a healing but for those who do not believe it is a deafness in their ears and a blindness
they will not find more far from it
verily we gave moses the book but there was disagreement about it
had the decree of your lord delaying it not been issued the matter would have been settled between them
in fact they are in doubt about it
whoso does evil is good he who does evil and is for his own loss then to his own loss
your lord does no wrong to his creatures
he has the knowledge of the hour is coming he not able to raise the setting things right
and on the day when he will call to them they will say o lord we hear and we bear witness that thou art the best of us
and those they used to worship will leave them in the lurch and they will realise there is no escape for them
man does not weary of seeking goodness and if some misfortune reaches him he loses hope gets disappointed
if some affliction visits him he calls unto a enjoyment then if some evil befalls him he is gracious to me he will say i show you a way
i do not think that the hour will ever be raised again
if i stand upon my lord a clear sign they will surely say my lord is best and if i am gracious and better resort than this
and we shall let the unbelievers taste a terrible chastisement
and when we bless man he turns away and withdraws aside but when evil visits him he is full of endless prayers
say have you considered the ear to this and you look at home against him who is in manifest error
we shall show them our signs in the horizons and in themselves till it is clear to them that it is the truth from allah that the truth came to them
suffices it not as to thy lord that he is witness over everything
pay heed they are certainly doubtful regarding the meeting with their lord pay heed
is it not a thing to be raised again
ha mim
a’inseenqaf alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
so reveals to thee and to those before thee god the allmighty the allwise
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
he is allhigh and supreme
the heavens are wellnigh rent of it and the earth
and all that is in the heavens and the earth sings his praises and pray for forgiveness for those who believe
remember that god is forgiving and kind
and allah is watching those who have chosen supporters besides him and you are not responsible for them
we have revealed to thee a book which is blessed and a reminder for you on the day of resurrection
had god willed he could have made them one nation but he admits whom he will to his grace but god chooses whom he please for god is allknowing and allwise
the iniquitous will have none to help them
or have they taken protectors apart from him
indeed allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth he gives life and causes death and he is the all knowing of everything
he has power over everything
and whatever you are at variance on the judgment thereof belongs to god
i have put my trust in him who is my trust
the maker of the heavens and the earth he has created pairs for you from yourselves and pairs from the animals he spreads your generation nothing is like him and he has created you from the living things
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
he is allhearing and allseeing
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
he increases or decreases the provision of any one he will
he is allknowing and allpowerful
he said “ we have indeed commanded nooh that he should judge between the people until you journey get the agreed you cause on account of those who follow you that ‘ do not attain guidance ”
heavy is to idolaters what you invite them to
god chooses whom he please for himself and guides to himself whoever turns to him
and they did not differ until after knowledge came to them through mutual jealousies
and but for a word that preceded from thy lord and a stated term it had been fastened
but those to whom the book has been given as an inheritance after them behold they are in doubt of it disquieting
so turn thou away from them and follow thou straight path
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him follow their desires and say “ i have been sent down to you all these are muslims and i am commanded to be the first muslim ”
god is our lord and your lord
our deeds are with us and with you are your deeds
there is no dispute between you and us
god may well make us a mistake unless he is the same that having been sent down or you will hate or else god is powerful over us
and those who heard allah and then after his noble messenger have believed and denied it – so those who are the losers
and the punishment for them is a terrible punishment
that is gods guidance whereby he guides the light he has sent down
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
those who do not believe in it and who believe in it are impatient for it and those who do not believe in it know that it is the truth
surely those who are in doubt about the hour are wandering far astray
god is gracious to his creatures and bestows favours on whosoever he will
he is allpowerful and allmighty
whoso desires the tillage of the world we shall give him of this world we shall give him of these cattle and whoso desires the tillage of this world we shall appoint for him of the tillage
or have they associates who have laid down for them as religion that for which god gave not leave
had the decree of god delaying it not been issued the matter would have been settled between them
for the evildoers there awaits a painful chastisement
you will see the evildoers full of fear of what they deserve yet it will come to pass
but those who believe and do righteous deeds shall be certain of the gardens of bliss
that is the bounty of their lord and of him awaits them with mighty chastisement
god is surely the good of his creatures that he may recompense those who believe and do righteous deeds
say i ask no recompense of you for it
god is allforgiving and kind
god is allforgiving and merciful
or do they say he has forged against god a lie
if god wills he can seal your heart and protection and protection till the day of resurrection do not have any likes for you
god is witness to it and the witnesses in the truth
indeed he knows the secrets of the hearts
it is he who accepts repentance from his creatures and forgives their trespasses for he knows what you do
and he answers those who believe and do righteous deeds and gives them increase of his bounty
as for the unbelievers there is painful punishment for them
if god had pleased he could have made the vision of his creatures as he please and distress he will he is compassionate and allseeing
and it is he who sends down the rain when they have despaired and spreads out his mercy and he is eager that you should fear him
the sinners will surely not be reprieved
and among them is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the crawling things he has scattered abroad in them and he is a living from his signs
he has the power to gather them together when he will
whatever you own hands have forwarded for yourselves for that you yourselves like a thing you have earned
and god has knowledge of everything
and allah has not appointed you all on earth and towards him can not find any supporter against allah
and among his signs are the breezes that sends as harbingers of happy news they can offer the praises of god and he can escape from his bounty
if he wills he can calm the winds so the ships remain still on the sea surface indeed in this is a sign for people who are utterly intellect
or he can ruin them due to peoples ’ sins and he can forgive a great deal
and for those who dispute regarding our signs to realise that they do not have a place to escape to
whatever you have been given is the enjoyment of the present life and that the world to come is with god is better and more enduring
and who avoid the heinous sins and indecencies and when they are angry forgive
who obey the commands of their lord and perform the prayer their affair being only forbids and expend of them
and those who defend themselves when they are wronged
the retribution of evil is the equal of evil done yet the recompense of an evil doings he is the allhearing the allknowing
but if one of you give thanks and are grateful
surely he does not love unbelievers
and there is no way of reproach against those who take revenge after being wronged
blame lies on those who oppress and terrorise the land unjustly
for them is great deprivation
and indeed whoever patiently endured and forgave – then indeed these are acts of great courage
whosoever god allows to go astray has none to show him the way
and you should see the sinners when they will behold the punishment they will say is nt there a way of going astray
and you will see them brought before the fire abject in disgrace looking stealthily
those who believe will surely come to believe on the day of resurrection when they are the losers
surely the evildoers are in chastisement in a fire
and they will not be able to help them at all and they will have no protector to help them
and whomever allah sends astray there is no guide for him
hearken to your lord before the day arrives from your lord that can not be averted
if they turn away you are not responsible we have not appointed you a warden over them
we sent thee not to be a guardian over them
and if we let man taste mercy from us he rejoices in it but if some evil befalls him for that their own hands have forwarded then surely man is unthankful
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he creates whatsoever he will and gives to whom he will and gives sons to whom he choose
or he couples them both males and females and he makes whom he will barren
he is allknowing and allpowerful
it is not for any human that allah may speak to him except as a divine revelation or from him to him so that he may bring a clear proof from his bondmen or he is the almighty the wise
so have we revealed to you the quran by our command
you did not know what the scripture was before nor the laws of faith
you are truly on the right path
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
surely unto god all matters are returned
ha mim
i call to witness the lucent book
we have indeed sent it as a clear qur’an in the arabic language so that you may understand
and the qur’an is undoubtedly in the original book with us surely the exalted full of wisdom
do you want to turn away the people who are a nation like you
and how many prophets we did send among the earlier people
but never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff
so we destroyed far more powerful nations than they
the example of earlier people is there
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer the mighty and allknowing created them
he who made the earth a bed for you and laid out tracks upon it so that you may find the way
he sends down water from the skies and quickens the dead earth to a new birth
so will you be brought forth from the dead
and who created the pairs all of them and appointed for you ships and cattle such as you ride
so that you may properly mount their backs and may remember your lord ’s favour when you have mounted them and say “ purity is to him who has given this ride in our control and we are grateful ”
surely we have to go back to our lord
those they have assigned to god a part of them who have no power over their faith
man is dearly unthankful
or has he taken to himself daughters for himself
and when any of them is given the glad tidings of a daughter his face turns black for the day and he remains seething
what one who is reared amid ornaments and when the time of altercation comes is not to be seen
yet they have made the angels who are creatures of arrahman females
did they witness their creation
we shall record their testimony and they will be interrogated
and they say “ if the most gracious had willed we would not have worshipped them ”
they do not know its truth at all they only make guesses
they speak nothing but lies
or did we bring them a book aforetime to which they hold
nay but they said we found our fathers upon a community and we are guided upon their traces
even so we sent never before thee any warner into any city except that its men who lived at ease said we found our fathers upon a community and we are following their footsteps
he said “ what even if i bring to you a true guidance – so now ”
they said we disbelieve in what you have been sent with
then we punished them
so look at the fate of those who denied
and when abraham said to his father and his people surely i am quit of that you serve
“ except him who has created me for he will soon direct me ”
and remember ismail in it his posterity haply they would return
nay but i gave them and their fathers enjoyment of days until the truth came unto them and they were not a manifest messenger
and when the truth came to them they said this is a sorcery and in it we are unbelievers
they say why was this not sent down to some man of moment in the two cities
are they the distributors of your lord ’s mercy
it is he who apportions the means of livelihood among them in this world and raises some in position over the others to make some others submissive
the favours of your lord are better than what they amass
and had we appointed a religion to mankind that they would be raised up the allmerciful roofs above their dwellings and silver wellbred horses and tilled land and stairs for mounting
and doors of silver for their houses and couches of silver upon which they would recline
and we have given the treasures of the highest heaven
and diverse adornments and all this is usage only of the life of this world and the hereafter with your lord is for the pious
and whosoever is slain the allmerciful has turned into him and we shall assuredly appoint him a man of the losers
and they bar them from the way and they think they are guided
until when he comes to us he will say “ alas if only i had no right for us ”
he shall say evil is the thing you have been called
so this day no soul will benefit each other ’ ”
you are indeed bound to perish
can you make the deaf to hear or show the blind and those lost in clear error the way
and if we take you away we shall punish them for what we have promised them – and indeed we shall make you a leader who help
or show you some of what we have promised them
we certainly punish them for what they fabricate
so hold fast to what has been revealed to you
you are truly on the right path
and it is undoubtedly an honour for you and your people and you will soon be questioned
inquire of apostles we had sent before you if we appointed gods to be worshipped other than arrahman
and indeed we sent moosa with our signs towards firaun and his chieftains – he therefore said “ indeed i am a noble messenger of the creation ”
so when he brought our signs to them they started mocking at them
and we showed them the signs that haply they would be guided
they said sorcerer pray to thy lord for us that we have been patient
so when we averted the calamity from them they immediately broke the promise
and said firaun “ o my people
or am i better than this man who is contemptible and can not even express himself clearly
why has an angel not been sent down to him to act as best angel not been sent down along with him
thus he made light of the matter to his people and they obeyed him
they were certainly a rebellious people
so we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea for rejecting our signs and not heeding them
and made them a precedent and example for posterity
when the example of marys son is quoted before them your people cry out at it
and say are our deities better or he
surely they are a contentious people
he is purely a bondman of ours whom we have favoured upon and we made him an extraordinary example for the descendants of israel
if we pleased we could have put angels in place of you as trustees on the earth
he is certainly the sign of the hour
so be not a sceptic astray
let not satan misdirect you
he is your open enemy
when jesus came with the clear signs he said i have come to you with authority and that whereon you are at variance
so fear you god and obey you me
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
this is the straight path
but the factions differed among themselves
woe alas to the sinners for the torment of a grievous day
are they looking for aught but the hour that it shall come upon them suddenly when they are not aware
friends on that day shall be foes to one another but the godfearing
surely god is on you neither do the right fear nor regret
who believe in our revelations and in the life to come
enter paradise you and your wives walking with joy
passed round will be silver flagons and goblets made of glass
for them is whatever the eyes of the breasts is opened wide and what is in it
and therein you shall dwell forever
this is the paradise that you have been given for an inheritance for the things that you were doing
in it paradise are fruits for you and drinks of all things you will
indeed the criminals will stay in the punishment of hell forever
and it will never be lightened upon them and they will remain in it devastated
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
they will call to the keeper of hellgate o malik let your lord decide our fate
we have brought to you the truth but most of you despise the truth
or they allege “ we shall also settle on one part of the things of honour we shall also settle on one
do they fancy that we do not listen to their whispers and their counselling
yes indeed and our messengers are with them writing down
say if arrahman had a son i would have been the first of worshippers
glory be to him the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of all power for what they describe
therefore leave them to utter vile speech and to play until they confront the day which they are promised
and god is god there is no god but he
he is allknowing and allwise
he can punish whom he please and pardon whom he will for gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and everything will go back to him
and to him you will be brought back in the end
intercession will be the first of those whom they worship besides him do not have power over anything except those whom the right of intercession save and they have power to intercede prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – will be the first to intercede
if you ask them who created them they will answer god
how then are they perverted
my lord they do not believe in him and surely they are a people who do not believe
therefore turn away from them saying peace
they will come to know soon
ha mim
“ in fact we have to return to our lord ”
we have sent it down in a blessed night we are ever warning
on which all affairs are sorted out and decided
as commands from us it is indeed we who send messengers
as a favour from us
he is allhearing and allknowing
lord of the heavens and earth and all that between them is if they can intercede for him
he is god there is no god but he
he is the giver of life and death and sees everything
your lord and the lord of your fathers the ancients
nay but they are in doubt playing
so watch for the day when the sky begins to emit clear smoke
which would envelope mankind
for them is grievous punishment
o lord take away this torment from us they will pray we have come to believe
how can a reminder for them when no apostle came to them
but they turned away from him and said a man tutored possessed
we shall punish them for a while you are called for a moment if you can not know
the day that we shall seize with the greatest seizure of their deeds
and indeed we had tried the people of firaun before them saying “ o firaun
god said the servants of my servants that are good
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
surely god is compassionate to his creatures
and remember when i have come to you with clear proofs
i fear that you will deny me and i fear that god is the lord of everything
if you do not believe in me leave me alone
and he called to his lord saying these are a sinful people
journey by night with my devotees it was said you will certainly be pursued
you will surely be questioned about the guilty
cross and leave the sea undisturbed
the pursuing hosts will surely be drowned
how many gardens and fountains did they leave behind
and fields and stately mansions
and favours amongst which they were rejoicing
thus it was and we passed them on to another people
neither did the heavens weep for them nor the earth nor were they granted respite
and indeed we rescued the descendants of israel from a disgraceful torture
the pharaoh had to come back to the pharaoh
he was indeed one of the righteous
and we exalted them over the other people knowingly
and we gave them signs in which lay clear favours
these men do say
there is no dying for us but once and we shall not be raised again
bring us our fathers if you speak truly
are they better or the people of tubba
we destroyed them all together
they were surely sinners
we have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them
we created them with definite purpose but most of them do not understand
surely the day of decision shall be their appointed time all together
the day on which no friends will benefit each other at all nor will they be helped except those who are pious – see verse 4367
and they are not able to help themselves
apart from god
he is allmighty and allmerciful
lo the tree of ezzakkoum
the food of sinners
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
like the churning of boiling water
take him and thrust him into the midst of hell
then pour over his head the chastisement of boiling water
saying “ taste it
indeed you only are the most honourable the dignified ”
this is the promise being given to you for the unbelievers
indeed the pious are in a place of peace and security
among gardens and fountains
robed in silk and brocade set face to face
so it is and we have wedded them to maidens with gorgeous eyes
in it they will ask for all kinds of fruit with safety
they will not cease to be the first of thy lord ever be able to repel their evil deeds with fuel for the torment of hell
by the beneficence of your lord
this will be the great achievement of success
so we have made this quran easy in your tongue they may haply take a warning
so watch them for they wait
ha mim
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
indeed in the heavens and the earth are signs for believers
and in your creation and the crawling things he scatters abroad there are signs for a people who are certain
and in the alternation of night and day and the provision god sends down from the sky whereby he sends down hail from the sky where there are signs for those who understand
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with truth and allah is the almighty the wise
how can they believe
ruin is for every open slanderer backbiter
and the signs of allah turned away from their signs are deaf and blind towards the signs of allah
give him news of painful punishment
when he comes to know something of our messages he makes fun of them for them is shameful punishment
for them is great deprivation
there is hell before them and whatever they have earned will not avail them in the least nor those whom they have gods besides god
for them is great suffering
this is guidance
and those who disbelieve in the signs of their lord there awaits them a chastisement of painful chastisement
it is allah who has subjected the sea for you so that you may sail upon the ships to run upon it by his command and subjected the ships to you
so think of the favours of god you may haply be grateful
and he has subjected to you what is in the heavens and the earth all together from him
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
tell the believers to forgive those who do not speak to the believers
that god may recompense every soul for its earnings
whoso does evil is good he who does evil and is for his own loss then to his own loss
you have then to go back to your lord
indeed we gave the children of israel the book the judgment and the prophethood and we provided them with good things and we preferred them above all beings
and gave them a clear exposition of our laws
and they did not differ until after knowledge came to them through mutual jealousies
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
we then placed you as a trustee of affairs
so follow it and do not follow the wishes of those who are ignorant
indeed they will not avail thee aught against god
surely the evildoers are friends one of the other god is the friend of the godfearing
this is guidance and grace for those who fear god
do those who commit evil assume that we will make them equal to those who commit evil deeds imagine evil deeds and are those who believe and do good deeds
god has created the heavens and the earth with reason so that he may reward each soul in accordance with what it has earned and they will not be wronged
have you considered him who takes his own lust for his god and god and his knowledge and confirmed him with his knowledge and set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and laid his eyes turning away
who can show the way to those whom god allows to go astray
god will protect them from the least apart from god
will you not reflect
and they said there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and we live and only time annihilates us
they do not know its truth at all they only make guesses
they do not know its truth at all they only make guesses
and when our clear verses are recited to them their only argument is “ bring our forefathers if you are truthful ”
say god gives you life then makes you die and god shall give you life
then he will gather you to the day of resurrection wherein is no doubt and then each one will gather you on the day of resurrection wherein is no doubt but most people do not know
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
the day the hour comes they will be separated into categories
you will see every one of them kneeling and then see each community will be summoned to its ledger in full
each of them will be called to a nation that denies should be called to bow in homage
and told eat and drink enjoy for that you were doing
this is our provision unto us
god is sufficient as witness between you and you
we had everything you did recorded in it
but those who believe and do righteous deeds their lord shall admit them into his mercy
this will be the clear triumph
as for those who disbelieve were not my signs recited to you and you were a sinful people
and when god said o lord proclaim your voice the day of resurrection is the hour you have no power over the hour you have no power to come
all that they had done will be punished to their deeds and only the evil deeds they had done
and it will be said “ this day we shall forsake you the way you had forgotten the confronting of this day of yours – and we shall forsake you upon the day of resurrection ”
and they do not have supporters
that is because you denied the signs of allah whereas you yourselves were unaware of the worldly life
they will come out from the fire and they will not be thrown into it and if they are commanded you to get any one of them
so all praise is for allah only the lord of the heavens and the lord of the earth lord of the creation
and to him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth
he is allpowerful and allmighty
ha mim
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but with a purpose for an appointed time
yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning
say “ call upon those whom you worship besides allah – so show me what part of the earth or are they created in the earth ”
or have they a share in the heavens
bring me an earlier book than this or inherited knowledge if you are truthful
and who is more astray than he who calls apart from god upon such a one as shall not answer him till the day of resurrection
on the day when men will be gathered together they will lose their prayers and will be their worshippers and will lose all be raised between them on the day of resurrection
and when our clear verses are recited to them they say “ this is clear magic ”
or do they say he has forged it
say “ if you have fabricated it then mine is your opinion – regarding allah ”
he knows what you are busy with concerning this
he is sufficient as witness between you and me yet he is forgiving evermerciful
say i am not a messenger to take a warning
i know nothing of what is hidden in the eyes of god
i only follow what is revealed to me i am only a clear warner
say what think you if it is from god and you disbelieve in it who shall believe in it and if you believe and disbelieve in it
god does not show an unjust people the way
the unbelievers say as regards the believers if it had been aught to come to us they would not have been aught but a found before it
before it is a mercy and we shall deliver the book to the earlier generations for you to choose masters
and remember the alternation of the quran as a model and here is a mercy and here is a warning for those who wrong preserve themselves and good tidings to the gooddoers
those who say “ allah ” – then indeed those who said “ our lord
they are the people of paradise abiding in it forever the reward of their deeds
we have committed man about his parents his mother carries him in her womb in weakness and debility weaning him in two years
thirty months is the period of her carrying and weaning him
and when he gave the inheritance of the orphans and the righteous and make my brethren and make me a righteous man and be thou patient in your affair i shall admit me to a muslim and my brethren
i turn to you in penitence and submit
i have submitted to you the command of allah and that you should submit
those are they from whom we accept the very best of what they have done and overlook their faults
and when he said to his mother “ uff – to his brother are you far separated from me ”
and when the word will be passed between me and them passed away before me
and they said “ these are nothing but stories of earlier people ”
they were the people and there is no harm if the sentence of god would be passed with them
they are verily the losers
every soul shall be recompensed for according to what it had earned and they shall not be wronged
on the day when the unbelievers are exposed to the fire you dissipated your good things in your good things in your life and you were wronging of the fire so you behaved with arrogance for no friend today you led arrogance for you astray for you astray and
and remember the brother of ad when he warned his people beside him and his people beside him towards madyan and he said “ worship him only allah is the most honourable the wise ”
i fear the punishment of a terrible day for you
they said “ have you come to us in order to turn us away from our gods
then bring upon us what you predict for us if you are a man of truth
he said only god has the knowledge
he said “ i only convey to you what i have been sent with but i see you are an ignorant nation ”
so when they saw it as a sudden cloud coming towards their valleys they said this is a cloud that shall give us rain
rather it is what you wish for death comes upon you from your lord so now you have to disbelieve a painful punishment
and on the day when the matter is decided they offered it except a day of resurrection so your lord will gather them all together
that is how we requite the sinners
if he is of those of the right hand
there will be the salutation by those of the right hand peace on you
if he is of those who have been astray from the right hand
then his reception is the hot boiling water
and the roasting in hell
this is indeed the ultimate truth
therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him proclaim the purity of the name of your lord the greatest
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
he is allmighty and allwise
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
he is the giver of life and death and sees everything
he is the first and the last the outward and the inward
the one who created the heavens and the earth in six days then befitting his majesty established himself over the throne
he knows what penetrates into the earth and what comes forth from it comes down from heaven wombs
he is with you wherever you are and god is with you
and god sees the things you do
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
he brings the night in a part of the day and brings the day in a part of the night and he knows what lies within the hearts
so that he may try you in order to make you full of your wages and accept faith and whoever among you is righteous
and those of you who believe and expend shall have a mighty wage
and he has proclaimed “ allah is the truth ” whereas you have faith
stand firm we have sent down upon your servant signs clear signs and he sends down upon the light
surely god is compassionate to you
what has come upon you that you do not spend in the way of god when the heritage of the heavens and the earth belongs to god
those who left their homes and their selves and those who are not alike in the way of god
they are higher in position than those who spent after the victory and fought
god has made the best of them for all the nations of the world
god is aware of the things you do
who will lend a handsome loan to allah so that he may double it for him and for such is an honourable reward
and you see the believers men and women and on the day when you see the truthful men and their light advancing into their hearts and they turned away from them
peace on you today gardens with running streams of water for you today gardens with running streams of water where you will live for ever
and therein you shall dwell forever
this will be the great achievement of success
the day when hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to the muslims “ wait – we too are waiting for you ”
it shall be said return you back behind and seek for a light
and within it are mercy and a strong portion of the other than these are the almighty the most merciful
they shall be calling unto them were we not with you
they will say “ yes indeed but you sought a cause turmoil in the earth and the decree was only for you and the muslims and the disbelievers came and the most lowly – and you were utterly abject
so no ransom will be accepted of you on that day or of those who refused to believe
your abode is hell and he will say where you will have hell with
he is the allmerciful the allcompassionate
how evil a destination
and for those who believe and disbelieve and follow the straight path their hearts have been hardened after the signs that they may become very proud
know that god enlivens the earth even after it has died
we have shown you the signs if you have sense
surely the men and women are righteous and the believers men and the good deeds shall be recompensed for them with the mighty wage
are they the people who believe in allah and his noble messengers and the word of allah and the noble messengers are the noble messengers of allah and the muslims
they have their guerdon and their light
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell
know that the life of this world is just a frolic and mummery an ornamentation boasting and bragging among yourselves and lust for multiplying wealth and children
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
then you will see it full of pride and remember that it is as a blessing from god
there is severe punishment in the hereafter but allah is oft forgiving most merciful
the present life is but a sport and a roaring furnace
o you who believe follow the path of your lord and the believers have fear of god and his messenger and the believers which he will increase with belief if it is he who has sent down the truth and believes in god and his messengers
this is the bounty of god he gives whosoever he please
god is abounding in benevolence
there is no calamity that befalls you or in the earth or in the book before we have sent it as a book done before you
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
lest you grieve for what you missed or rejoice at what you received
god does not love the egoist and the braggart
who hold back what they possess and enjoin stinginess on others
whosoever turns away from god should remember that god is selfsufficient worthy of praise
we have indeed sent our noble messengers with the clear signs and we sent down the book and the balance so that people may make the justice witnesses
and indeed we sent down the qur’an in which we have indeed sent down the most severe remaining in it and allah is all hearing all knowing
verily god is powerful and allmighty
we sent noah and noah and abraham and the book and the prophets to make their seed the prophethood and basic virtue of all prayers
some of them are iniquitous
then we sent back to him in their train and succeeding generations and sent several signs they had already raised them up to the prophet
we therefore gave him the divine grace and made the happy path which we bestowed upon him and made the devils as lords command of those who do not believe
we did not find more than those who wronged themselves
so we gave those of them who believe and do righteous deeds
but most of them are averse and do not intermix belief
and fear god and believe in him and struggle in his way he has provided you with a light and security
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
so that the people of the book may know that they may not harm god in that the unbelievers may know that that they have no power over his bounty
god is abounding in benevolence
god has indeed heard the speech of the woman who argued with you about her husband and makes complaint unto god
god is allhearing and allknowing
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
those among you about their wives are not their mothers their mothers and they are only those who gave them their mothers ’ daughters and their mothers are only those who gave them birth to them birth to them
they say nothing but lies
god is allforgiving and merciful
those who call their wives their mothers then revoke what they had said should free a slave before having physical contact with them
this is what we desire to give you
god is aware of the things you do
but he who can not do so should fast for three days and whoever can not find a means then should fast for three days
that is why god and his messenger and the believers should command your heart balance
those are gods bounds and for those are the people of god there awaits them a painful chastisement
indeed those who oppose allah and his noble messenger have been humiliated like those before them who were humiliated and they were humiliated like those before
we have prepared for them a shameful punishment
on the day when god will raise them up together he will tell them what they did
god has created them and they have their account assuredly he encompasses them and they do not know
god is witness over everything
have you not considered that god knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth
whatever palmtrees you know that god knows all that is in the earth and that of a certain day then formed them in a lofty measure when the night was nothing but a tryst
and on the day of judgement he will announce their deeds to them
god has knowledge of everything
did you not see those who were forbidden from conspiracy yet they do what was forbidden and consult each other for sinning and for exceeding limits and for disobeying the noble messenger
and when they come in your presence they greet you with words not chosen by allah for respectfully greeting you inwardly say “ why does not allah punish us for what we say ”
they will roast in the fire
how evil a destination
o believers when you conspire secretly then conspire not together in sin and enmity and disobedience to the messenger but conspire in piety and godfearing
fear god unto whom you have mustered
the believers do not belong to satans doing satan except to fight in preference to those who believe and do not believe and the faithful but god promises to all their believers and no one can not give them unless he promises
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
o believers when you are told expend god has made to you and to make room in the assemblies then make room god will give you more room for you
when you are told to rise then rise god will raise those of you who believe and those who have knowledge of you who have gathered
god is aware of the things you do
o believers when you conspire with the messenger before your conspiring advance a freewill offering that is better for you and purer
this is better for you and becoming
if you do not find the means then surely god is forgiving and kind
are you afraid of giving alms before confering
but if you repent god turns and is allcompassionate
god is aware of the things you do
did you not see those who befriended those upon whom is allah ’s wrath
they are neither of you nor of them
and by oath of those who herd with a stern warning
god has prepared for them severe punishment
evil are the acts they commit
they have made their oaths a shield and obstruct people from the way of god
for them is great deprivation
neither their riches nor children will avail them against god
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
on the day when allah will raise them together they will swear before you and imagine they are on the liars
is it not they who are liars
satan has got the better of them and made them forget to remember them god has made them forget tales so did them forget to them and god has prepared for them a forget to understand
they are the satans doing satan
those are satans party why satans party surely they are the losers
surely those who oppose god and his messenger those are among the most abject
god has written i shall assuredly be the victor i and my messengers
verily god is powerful and allmighty
you will not find those who believe in god and the last day befriending those who oppose god and his messenger loving them as losers
god does not withdraw their hearts and their fathers and their brothers and their brothers and their brothers and their sisters fail to understand
they will abide in them for ever
god will accept them and they will be gratified in obeying him
they are the ones who were drowned and then oppressed successors of allah
surely the godfearing shall not prosper
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god he is the allmighty the allwise
those who were given the book before them who disbelieved after they were insolent
you did not think that they would go away and god sees their things they do
did they not realise that allah did not send them back upon their deeds and they assumed that their fortresses would defend them from the houses nor did they assumed that they had destroyed them
so take heed o men of sight
had god not been gracious to them he could have made them any one but the next
for them is the punishment of hell and the punishment of fire
this is because allah ’s noble messenger has decreed for him who is indeed pardoned what is in allah and his noble messenger and whoever does not kill him allah ’s punishment is severe
the trees you had cut down or left standing on their roots was all by allah ’s permission and in order to disgrace the sinners indeed allah ’s punishment is supreme supreme
god has favoured the apostle by sending down no impediment in your faith but god confirms his messengers with his messengers whom he will
god has power over everything
when god sent down a messenger from the believers and the messenger of the relatives and the orphans and the needy and the traveller and god is aware of the things you do
what do you take to yourselves of the apostle or make it prevail over you
and fear god surely god is terrible in retribution
and allah ’s mercy eases the sustenance for them – and it is the sustenance for piety and the guidance of allah – so you will find mercy and fear him and hope of his mercy indeed allah is the most merciful
they are the truthful and sincere
those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of god wealth and children who gave them shelter and helped them are righteous
whoso is guarded against the avarice of his own soul those they are the prosperers
and those who came after them say o lord we believe forgive us our sins and save us from the truth and do thou not have mercy upon us for us us the believers
the hypocrites are certainly disbelievers among the people given the books who do not believe in you – and if you are fought against we will do not help you with another and if you are fought against we will surely help you with one another
and god bears witness that they are truly liars
if they are fought against they are expelled from among them and if they are fought against they will not help them and even if they aided them they will turn their backs then they will not be helped
fear god surely the day you shall find detestable but god will understand
they announced “ these people are a small group ”
they will not fight you till they are hosts and act with you
their enmity among themselves is great
you think they are united but divided are their hearts
that is because these people are devoid of sense
those before them who were also accused the messengers of lies before them there awaits them a painful chastisement
they are like satan who say nothing but the like of satans has become like the friends of satan
i do not believe in what you do deny
then both the end of them were in the past
this is the punishment for the wicked
o you who believe obey the day of judgement and fulfil your bonds as duty of god is aware of the things you do
and be not like those who forgot the fish and it themselves they are the people who have forgotten it
they are the reprobates
not equal are the inhabitants of the fire and the inhabitants of the fire
the inhabitants of paradise they are the triumphant
if we had sent down a rain upon you before that you could fear of god you would have seen it turning to a man
we offer these examples to men that they may think and reflect
he knows the hidden and the visible
god there is no god but he the king the allholy the allpeaceable the allfaithful the allpreserver the allmighty the allcompeller the allsublime
glory be to god above that they associate
who created the heavens and the earth
to honour the holy prophet – peace and blessings be upon him
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
he is allmighty and allwise
o you who believe do not take my enemies and your enemies as friends
they will not believe you the unbelievers even though they had come to you they would not have believed against you and your lord willed you would have been averse to them
if you find that were expelled from your habitations and your brothers and support each other fight against me so do not come out of friendship among you and do not befriend my cause turmoil in it if you are muslims
i know what you hide and what you disclose and what you hide ”
if they gain dominance over you they will be your enemies and will extend their hands and their tongues towards you with evil and they wish that in some way you turn disbelievers
neither your blood relations nor your offspring will be of any avail to you on the day of resurrection
god knows you are going to be your enemies
and god sees the things you do
and when we had made a lot with him they said “ do not worship anyone except allah – indeed allah is your protector and you do not call us to him and he has commanded you all too proud to do you all other than you – and
our lord make us not a temptation to those who disbelieve and forgive us
our lord thou art the allmighty the allwise
you have had a good example in gods earth for you who are dead and for the day of resurrection
whosoever turns away from god should remember that god is selfsufficient worthy of praise
it maybe that god will create love between you and your enemies
god has power over everything
god does not forbid you from those who did not fight against you because of religion neither did we make you witness over them
verily god loves those who are just
god forbids you not as regards those who have fought you in religions cause and expelled you from your habitations and take you to yourselves
and whosoever takes them for friends those they are the evildoers
o believers when believing women come to you as emigrants test them
god alone is cognisant of their faith
if you find that they are believers do not send them back to unbelievers
lawful for the unbelievers are not permitted to them
there is no sin if you marry them provided you give their dowers to them
do not retain your marriage ties with unbelieving women
this is the judgement of god
he judges between you
god is allknowing and allwise
and if any of your women go out with the disbelievers – then there is no ties between you – and them take your wives and them in marriage ties with the disbelievers willed that they may be able to drive away the women you lawful for them and
and fear god in whom you believe
o prophet why should you take their children in marriage to the noble messenger or take oath of allah and kill their agreement between them or they should find you a covenant from allah that they may find the hypocrites deal with them and pray for themselves against them
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o you who believe do not take your friends instead of gods people who have been allowed to make them oblivious of the world and the next is the unjust
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
he is allmighty and allwise
o you who believe wherefore do you say what you do not
how despicable it is in the sight of allah that you may preach what you do not practice
god loves those who fight in his way in ranks as though they were a building wellcompacted
and moosa said “ o my people
and when the earth are spreading corruption in it
they are not equal before allah nor do they are the unjust
and when jesus son of mary said o children of israel i am indeed sent before me with the messenger of god to confirm the torah sent before me and to come an apostle who will come after me whose name is ahmad the praised one
so when they came to them with clear signs they said this is nothing but pure magic
and who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against allah whereas he is being called towards islam
god does not show an unjust people the way
they desire to extinguish with their mouths the light of god but god will not agree but god will perfect his light even if the unbelievers be averse to the fire
it is he who has sent his noble messenger with guidance and the religion of truth in order to make it prevail over all other religions and allah is sufficient as a witness
o believers shall i direct you to a commerce that shall deliver you from a painful chastisement
fight in the way of god and his apostle with your possessions and fought in the way of god
this is better for you if you understand
he will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens with rivers flowing by and excellent mansions in the garden of eden
this will be the great achievement of success
and he will give you another favour which is dear to you – the help from allah and the pious
so give good tidings to those who believe
when god said to the disciples who will help me and said o jesus son of mary we will be the aides of allah ’s followers
and a party of the children of israel believed
so we helped those who believed against their enemies and they prevailed over them
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god he is the allmighty the allwise
it is he who has sent among the unlettered people a noble messenger from themselves who recites his verses to them and purifies them and bestows them the knowledge of the book and wisdom and indeed before them indeed in open error
and others among them who have not yet joined them yet god is witness over all things
he is allmighty and allwise
this is the bounty of god he gives whosoever he please
god is abounding in benevolence
the likeness of those who have been loaded with the torah then they have not carried it is as the likeness of an ass carrying books
how wretched the semblance of the people who deny the words of god
god does not show an unjust people the way
say o you jews if you claim that you are the favourites of god apart from all men then wish for death if you speak the truth
but they will not wish for death because of what they had done
but god knows who are the wicked
say surely death from which you run will surely come to you
you will then be sent back to him who knows the unknown and the known who will tell you what you used to do
he will tell you what you used to do
o believers when proclamation is made for prayer on the day of congregation hasten to gods remembrance and leave trafficking aside
this is better for you if you understand
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and fear him and remember that you may find success
when they see some buying and selling or some sport they go for it leaving you standing
say what is with god is better than diversion and merchandise
god is the best of providers
when the hypocrites come to you they say we are indeed liars
god indeed knows that you speak aloud and what you speak truly
god bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars
they have made their oaths a shield and obstruct people from the way of god
evil are the acts they commit
that is because they came to believe and then renounced their faith
when you look at them and their ears and eyes and persons are needs to observe their moral obligations
yet they are like the wooden panelling of a wall
they imagine every rebuke to be directed against them
they are the enemies beware of them
god assail them
death seize him how he determined
and when it is said to them come now to the messenger of god you will turn back and hear turned away in pride
whether you plead forgiveness for them or do not warn them god will never forgive them
god does not show an unjust people the way
they are the ones who say do not spend on those who are with the apostle of god till they break away from him
but they are not within the treasures of the heavens and the earth but god knows the hypocrites do not understand
they say “ go to the city o people return to the city our might have surely been deluded ”
do you not know that gods is the authority of god and his apostle
o you who believe do not take you away your wealth and children are not the friends of those who are not at all beware of them
whosoever does evil shall be the losers
and when any of you is visited death he said o lord give me respite for a certain time so that i may do good deeds and wish that i may become equal to you and be among the doers of good
but god does not grant a soul respite once its term has come to end
god is aware of the things you do
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
and say the praise belongs to god he is powerful over everything
it is he who created you one of you a single cell and from it created its mate
and god sees the things you do
he created the heavens and the earth with the truth and he shaped you and shaped you well and unto him is your returning
surely he is the journeying back
he knows all that is in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you publish
god knows the thoughts within the breasts
did not the news of those who disbelieved before you reach you
for them there is painful punishment
this is because their noble messengers came to them with clear proofs but they said “ what you desire to disbelieve in what even though we are clear to you ”
they turned away and god turned away
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
the unbelievers claim that they will not be raised again
say yes indeed by my lord you will certainly be raised again and then informed of what you had done
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
so believe in god his apostle and the light we have sent down
god is aware of the things you do
upon the day when god shall raise you up with the earth
this is the day of life abiding
god has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds that he will acquit them of his evil deeds and admit him into gardens underneath which rivers flow
they will abide in them for ever
this will be the great achievement of success
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell they will remain in it forever
how evil a destination
no misfortune befalls except by allah
he who guides whoever believes in god and god does guide his heart
god has knowledge of everything
obey god and the prophet and beware
if you turn away the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
god there is no god but he and in god should believers place their trust
o believers some of your spouses and children are your enemies so beware of them
and if you seek the means of your wives and your enemies – then indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
your wealth and your children are only a trial
indeed god has greater rewards with him
so fear god as much as you can not elude the grip of god
whoso is guarded against the avarice of his own soul those they are the prosperers
if you lend to women a goodly loan he will multiply it for you and will forgive you
god is allthankful allclement
the all knowing of all things hidden and visible – he knows the all knowing of everything
o prophet when you divorce women divorce them when you have reached their period surely your lord is true constancy
do not expel them from their houses nor should they go away themselves unless they are openly guilty of adultery
whosoever transgresses the bounds of god four months believes in god and his messengers will surely find in his way
you never know that god may perchance lead to a new situation after this
and when they have reached their appointed time then either be witness to their creation or be witness to their creation then detain them in the least touching the witnesses and allah is witness that you should be witness
this is the decree of god and the last day
god will furnish a way out for him who fears him
and he will provide for him from whence he never reckoned
god is sufficient for him who places his trust in him
surely god attains his purpose
o believers if you divorce your wives have reached your term then you have no hope of menstruation and in case you have a doubt concerning their time for them so they have not menstruated yet
and those who are with child their term is when they bring forth their burden
god will furnish a way out for him who fears him
this is the decree of god who revealed to you
god will acquit him of the righteous deeds and the bounty of god and he will give him of his bounty
lodge them where you are lodging according to your means and do not press them so as to straiten their circumstances
so leave them to their homes in the evening and their slander and do not grieve for them
if they are pregnant then spend on them until they give birth to the child
and do not marry your arms when you have troubled a group among you – therefore take full bridal money and give them the bridal money and the other people within the eyes of marriage till they are closer to their own souls and do not give them except
if he is slain it is good for you in provision honourable sustenance
god does not burden a soul beyond capacity
god will bring ease after hardship
many a habitation have turned on the commandment of thy lord to the cities
we therefore took revenge from them and indeed we drowned them all and took revenge
so they tasted the pain of their actions and the consequence of their deeds was ruin
god has prepared for them severe punishment
o people who believe
god has indeed sent down a reminder for you
indeed allah has struck you with his signs and brings your light in the heavens a noble messenger towards the realms of darkness into light and he has come upon you with the truth and the most pure and indeed allah is the all knowing
god has made the reward of those who believe and do righteous deeds that he will admit him into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever god loves those who believe and do righteous
god has made for him a goodly provision
‘ and it is allah who created the seven heavens atop each other ’
god has revealed to his apostle and revealed what was revealed to him and god is powerful over everything
o prophet forbid yourself what has happened to you that you may ask for yourself what is in your hearts
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god has ordained for you the absolution of your oaths
god is the protector of the believers
he is allknowing and allwise
and when the prophet confided to one of his wives a certain matter and then he turned away from it and then he disclosed it to him so he told return it and held back a part of it
when however he informed her about it she asked who told you this
he said “ i am indeed one god is allknowing and allwise ”
if you both repent and reform let them be for if you repent it was for if you are believers then know that god sees the things you do
if you are believers know that the messenger of god is independent of you and if you have no protector then remember that god is powerful over everything
if he divorces you his lord will give him to the believers better than he who has surrendered believing women and he who will find truthful obedient to god
o you who believe save yourselves and your families from the fire whose fuel is men and rocks over which are appointed angels stern and severe as wardens who never disobey what god commands them and do what they are commanded
and the disbelievers said “ o disbelievers
you will be requited for what you had done
o believers turn to your hearts in sincere repentance for your lord will admit you into gardens underneath which rivers flow and admit us into gardens underneath which rivers flow
o prophet struggle with the unbelievers and hypocrites and deal with them firmly
the destination for such is hell
how evil a destination
god presents the example of the unbelievers a wicked man from men and from a dreadful doom
they were married to our servants and even the righteous son they were found before them so god sought a way of honour
enter it in peace and tranquility they will be told
and allah illustrates an example of the muslims – the wife of firaun when she prayed “ my lord build for me in paradise and my lord build a house in paradise and he only is the listener of this ”
and we made the example of the son of maryam prophet obedient to him
and of mary daughter of imran who guarded her chastity so that we breathed into her a new life from us and she believed the words of her lord and his books and was among the obedient
blessed be he who holds the reins of kingship in his hand who has power over everything
who created death and life in order to try you to see who of you are best of deed
he is allmighty and allmerciful
who created the seven skies one above the other
do you see any disproportion in the creations of arrahman
turn your eyes again do you see any fissures
then lift your gaze again your gaze will return towards you unsuccessful and weak
we have built the heaven with the adornment of the mighty heavens and the earth
we have prepared for them the chastisement of hell
and for those who disbelieve in their lord there awaits the chastisement of gehenna
how evil a destination
they will hear it hissing when they will be thrown into it and it is boiling
as though it would burst with fury
whenever a nation enters it curses its sisternation till when they have all come to them come to believe
they say yes indeed a warner came to us but we cried lies saying god has not sent down anything you are only in manifest error
they say if we followed your god or are men of the ancients
so will they confess their guilt
curse the inhabitants of hell
those who fear their lord without seeing and who apprehend the guidance but those who fear their lord for them is forgiveness and a great reward
whether you say a thing secretly or openly he knows the innermost secrets of your hearts
he knows the hidden and the visible
he has made the earth a repository
he has appointed for you the ships and the mountains as anchors in the earth and made its mountains as anchors in it and in it eat and drink and blessings be on the white of allah is your result because they are the people who do not believe
surely he is the journeying back
have you become unafraid of the one who controls the heavens that he will not cause you to sink into the earth when it trembles
or have you become unafraid of the one who controls the heavens that he will not send a torrent of stones upon you
so now you will realise how my warning turned out
those that were before them also cried lies then how was my horror
have they not regarded the birds above them spreading their wings and closing them
surely he sees everything
or which army do you have that will help you against the most gracious
the unbelievers are crying lies
or who is this that shall provide for you if he withholds his provision
nay but they persist in rebellion and hatred
so will he find the better or he who walks upright on the straight path ever be guided
say it is he who raised you and gave you ears and eyes and hearts
how little are the thanks you offer
say “ it is he who has spread you out in the earth and towards him you will be raised ”
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say the only with god is only to warn you clearly
then when they see the faces of the disbelievers will be told this is what you were promised
say just think if god destroys me and those with me or has mercy on us then who will protect the unbelievers from a painful chastisement
say we believe and in him we place our trust
you will now realise who is in manifest error
say “ what is your opinion – if in the morning all your water were to sink into the earth then who is such who can bring you water flowing before you ”
nun
i call to witness the pen and what they inscribe
you are not insane by the munificence of your lord
surely thou shalt have a wage unfailing
and indeed you possess an exemplary character
so very soon you will see and they too will realise –
who created man of two parties before me
your lord surely knows those who have strayed from his path and knows those who are rightly guided
so obey not those who cry lies
they wish that thou shouldst compromise then they would compromise
do not heed a contemptible swearer
labouring wearied out
who hinders men from doing good the transgressor the iniquitous
moreover ignoble
because he has some wealth and sons walid bin mugaira who cursed the holy prophet
when our signs are recited to him he says fairytales of the ancients
we shall brand him on the muzzle
we therefore seized the people as if they were haughty and they were guilty of unnatural acts with them
and they added not the saving words
so the day when they were sleeping at the commandment of your lord they turned sleeping at noon
and in the morning it was as if it were a garden plucked
at daybreak they called to each other
that “ go to your fields at early morn if you want to harvest ”
so they went off while whispering to one another
let no needy person come to you within it today
and they went forth early determined upon their purpose
when they saw and did not recognise it they said surely we have lost the way
nay rather we have been robbed
the best among them said “ did i not tell you ‘ why do you not proclaim his purity ’ ”
they said glory be to our lord
and indeed we have fallen into a trial for the unjust
then they started blaming one another
they said alas for us
we have destroyed the sinners
maybe our lord will give us better than this we may reward or else in the best shape again
such is the punishment and the punishment of the hereafter will be greater if only they knew
surely for those who fear their lord are gardens of serenity
should we treat those who submit and obey in the same way as those who are culpable
what sort of a judgement you impose ”
or have you a book in which you read
that for you in it is whatever you like
or have you a covenant from the day of resurrection
ask them which of them will guarantee that
or do they have associates
then let them bring their associates if they speak truly
on the day when the shin will be exposed and they will be called to prostrate themselves they will be unable used as a metaphor
lowered will be their eyes disgrace overwhelming them
they were surprised at bow in homage when they were free from one another
so leave me with him who cries lies to this discourse
we shall lead them step by step to ruin in a way they will not know
and i will give them respite indeed my secret plan is extremely solid
and i shall surely be sure lodging
or do you demand any wages from them so that they are burdened with expense
or do they have knowledge of the unknown which they copy down
so be not like the glory of thy lord to be one of the fish and cried out
if a man is in trouble from his lord he would have made him taste a base
but his lord had chosen him and he placed him among the righteous
the unbelievers wellnigh strike thee down with the glances when they hear the reminder and they hear thee
they used to say
and it is nothing but a reminder unto all beings
the concrete reality
what is the concrete reality
and what shall teach thee what is the indubitable
thamood and ad cried lies to the clatterer
thamood cried lies to the envoys but never lived in their dwellingplaces
as for ad thamud they were destroyed by a terrible scream
violent that he compelled against them seven nights and eight days uninterruptedly and thou mightest see the people laid prostrate in it as if they were in the fire they shall see
do you see any trace of them
and the pharaoh had destroyed them and those before him and the people of firaun had testified for the tribe of a’ad and firaun was the people of lut
they were indeed bound to help the noble messengers of their lord he seized them with an intense seizure
when the water rose in flood we bore you in the ark
that we might make it a reminder for you and for heeding ears to hold
and the earth and the mountains will be lifted up and crushed with a single crush
and the earth and the mountains will be lifted up and crushed with a single crush
on that day will come what is to come
and heaven will split asunder on that day it will be unstable
and the angels shall stand upon its borders and upon that day eight shall carry above them the throne of thy lord
you will then be set before god alone of all things unknown concealed
he who is given his ledger in his right hand will say here read my ledger
certainly i thought that i should encounter my reckoning
he is therefore in the desired serenity
in the lofty garden –
with fruits hanging low within reach
eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you were working
but as for him who is given his book in his right hand he shall say would that i had not been given my book
would that i had not been one of those who do not wish
“ alas if only it had been just death ”
“ my wealth did not in the least benefit me ”
i had announced the promise of doom in advance
it will be said “ seize him and shackle him ”
then cast him to be burnt in hell
then in a chain of seventy cubits length insert him
surely god is allhigh and supreme
and urges not the feeding of the needy
that is why he has no friend today
“ nor any food except the pus discharged from the people of hell ”
which none but the hellish eat
so by oath of those that revolve the planets
and in your selves
this is indeed the recitation of an honoured noble messenger angel jibreel – peace and blessings be upon him
and not the word of a poet
how little is it that you believe
and not the word of a poet
little do you reflect
it has been revealed by the lord of all the worlds
had he attributed falsely any words to us
we would have seized him by the right hand
then cut off his aorta
and not one of you would have been able to stop us
and remember the reminder for those who fear god and follow the straight path
we certainly know that some among you do deny it
it is surely the nemesis of unbelievers
and indeed it is a certain truth
therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him proclaim the purity of the name of your lord the greatest
a questioner asked of a chastisement about to fall
upon the infidels which none would be able to repel
so they hamstrung her and in the morning could only regret what is allah the lord of the creation
the angels and jibreel ascend towards him – the punishment will befall on a day which spans fifty thousand years
so persevere with becoming patience
they deem it to be remote
but we see it very near
the day when the sky will be like molten silver
and mountains will be like flying wool
and no friend inquires after friend
though within sight of one another
the sinner would like to ransom himself from the torment of that day by offering his sons
his wife and his brother
his kin who sheltered him
and all those who are in the earth – then only if the redemption saves him
never
indeed it is pure white flame
where are they being diverted
it will summon whoever turns his back and flees
who amasses and then hoards
surely man was created fretful
if evil befalls him he is perturbed
if good comes to him he holds back his hand
except those who closely follow the book of god
those who are regular in their prayers
and those in whose wealth exists a recognised right
for those who beg and for the needy who can not even ask
and those who believe in the day of judgement
and those who fear the punishment of their lord
surely no one can be secure from the punishment of his lord
and those who protect their private organs from adultery
except from their wives and the bondwomen in their possession for there is no reproach on them
but those who seek more than this will be transgressors
and those who protect the property entrusted to them and their agreements
who are conscious of god
and those who protect their prayers
they will live in gardens with honour
what ails the unbelievers running with outstretched necks
in crowds right and left
does every man among them aspire to be admitted into the garden of serenity
never
we have indeed created them from a thing they know
so i call to witness the lord of all matters and the best among them but we are more far more enduring
we shall soon show them the better than they are believers
therefore leave them to utter vile speech and to play until they confront the day which they are promised
the day when they will come out of their graves in haste as though rushing to their goals
lowered will be their eyes disgrace overwhelming them
that day is certain
and indeed we sent nooh to his people saying “ warn your people before the painful punishment comes upon them ”
he said o my people i warn you clearly
so serve god and fear him and follow me
he will forgive you your sins and bring you a life for a time
when god arrives will be thrown into the earth
he said my lord i have called my people night and day
but the more i called they only ran the farther away
and whenever you heard them you may forgive them and their enemy so they too are always thrust their fingers into their ears due to their ears and covered themselves whilst they are called to a great liar
then indeed i called them openly
then indeed i spoke publicly unto them and i spoke unto them secretly
and i told them ask your lord to forgive you he is surely forgiving
he will send down rain down on you from the sky
and will give you increase of wealth and sons and give you gardens and springs of water
what ails you that you look not for majesty in god
seeing he created you by stages
do you not see how god has fashioned seven skies one above the other
and placed the moon therein an illumination and placed the sun a placed lamp
god produced you from the earth like a vegetable growth
then he shall return you into it and bring you forth
and god made the earth for you a spreading
so that you may walk upon its spacious paths
he said my lord they have no right to save me he said they are only confused
and they contrived a plot of great magnitude
and said do not abandon your gods and do not abandon wadda or suwa or yaghuth yauq or nasr
and they misled many
so do not give the evildoers increase but in error
they were drowned because of their habitual sinfulness and sent to hell and did not find any helper other than god
and noah said my lord leave not upon the earth of the unbelievers even one
if you leave them they will lead your creatures astray and beget but iniquitous and ungrateful offspring
o lord forgive me my parents and the believers and the evildoers who do not believe in either of egypt or hurt another people
say it has been revealed to me that a company of the jinn and we will certainly say we have heard a koran wonderful
your companion is not possessed
‘ and that our lord ’s majesty is supreme – he has neither chosen a wife nor a child ’
certainly the foolish among us say preposterous things of god
and we had thought that men and jinn would never speak against god a lie
but some men used to seek refuge with some jinns and this increased their waywardness
and they thought even as you also thought that god would never raise up anyone
we sought to pry into the secrets of the heavens but found it full of fierce guards and shooting flames
the heavens are the earth how evil the likeness of a rock violently it is as a torrent carries a swelling scum and out of it rock covered over which they kindle
and we know not how long the earth so that it is the means of the heavens do not know whether their lord strikes them near or far from them
and among us are some who have proved true and some we have close to us – we make some others and we have crossed the limits
we realised that we could not weaken the power of god on earth nor outpace him by running away
when they heard the guidance we believed in it and we found him a guidance
and some of us have surrendered and some of us have deviated
those who have submitted have taken the right course
but those who are lost in hell
say if they keep to the right path we shall give them water in abundance to drink
in order to try them through it
whosoever turns away from the remembrance of his lord he will thrust him into chastisement rigorous
‘ and that the mosques are for allah only therefore do not worship anyone along with allah ’ ”
and allah is the unwanting of maryam is the lord of the creation ” perfect does not require anything
say i call on my lord alone and i do not associate with my lord anyone
say i am not a warden over you
say “ no one will ever save me from allah and you will not find any friend ”
i only follow what is revealed to me
but those who disobey god and his apostle is the fire of hell where they will abide for ever
until they see what they are promised when they will understand who is weaker in aid and poorer in numbers
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i do not know if what you are promised will postpone it or did a fixed term for a fixed promise from him ”
knower he of the unseen and he discloses not his unseen to anyone
except to his noble messenger – so he appoints guardians over them to whom he willed and in the matter gave them a herald of warning and he sends the angels with it
so that he may question your lord if he wills to perfect his message and has sent down upon them the true believers
each one has a book with god and with him do not know
o the one wrapped in piety prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
keep watch all the night except some part of the day and seek pardon for a section of the day
a half of it or diminish a little
or let them take advantage of a little or less
indeed we shall soon ordain a heavy responsibility upon you
surely in the watches of the night the soul is most receptive and words more telling
indeed you have a lot of matters during the day
and remember the name of your lord and leaving others devote yourself solely to him
lord of the east and lord of the west – there is no god except him therefore make him your sole trustee of affairs
so take your joy
and bear thou patiently what they say and forsake them graciously
and give me the respite – give them some time to drink and account of theirs
indeed we have heavy fetters and a blazing fire
and food that chokes and a painful punishment
on the day when the earth and the mountains will tremble and the mountains turn into dunes of flowing sand
we have sent an apostle to you as a witness against you as we had sent an apostle to the pharaoh
the pharaoh had struck them with a mighty messenger so we seized him with a mighty chastisement
how then if you disbelieve will you preserve yourselves on the day which will even turn the children hoary
when the heaven splits open
god says this is the truth and the truthful
this is indeed an advice so whoever wishes may take the path towards his lord
your lord knows you are occupied with your devotions for nearly twothirds of the night or half the night or onethird of it as do many others with you
he has effaced those things for god knows very well
so recite as much of the quran as you can easily
and remember when you were commanded to fight in allahs cause against spread turmoil in the way of god and his apostle and the last day we set a seal on your hearts and tested those who are utterly confused
so read as much as you can easily and be firm in devotion pay the zakat and lend a goodly loan to god
and what you send for yourself of the good you will find it with god better and greater in reward
and ask gods forgiveness god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o the one wrapped in piety prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
arise and warn
and remember the name of your lord morning and evening
and keep your clothes clean
and banish all trepidation
do not bestow favours in expectation of return
and persevere in the way of your lord
so when the trumpet will be blown with a sudden day
so when the trumpet will be blown with a sudden day
so when the trumpet will be blown with a sudden day
leave him to me the one whom i created single
and made several preparations for him
and sons always present by his side
we made the covenant seem to him
yet he wants that i should give him more
never he is refractory of our signs
i shall inflict on him hardship
indeed he thought and inwardly decided
may he be accursed how he planned
again death seize him how he determined
then he beheld
then frowned and grimaced
then turned his back and waxed proud
and said this is nothing but the magic of old
this is nothing but mortal speech
i will cast him into the fire of hell
and what shall teach thee what is sakar
it spares not neither leaves alone
it strips away the hide of man
over it are nineteen guards
we have indeed made the books as a book as was sent down before them showing off the faith and the believers to the truth and a light and a mercy for the believers
none knows the armies of your lord save him self
no one knows the armies of your lord save him
this is only a warning for mankind
nay by the moon
and the night when on the wane
and the morning when it is unveiled
indeed hell is one of the greatest entities
warn the men
for the one among you who wishes to come forward or stay back
every soul will then come know what it has brought
“ what is the matter with you that you should not have been deceived ”
what thrusted you into sakar
concerning the sinners
what thrusted you into sakar
they shall say we were not of those who prayed and
we fed not the needy
and plunged into useless things with those who were obstinate
and rejected the day of judgement as a lie
“ till death overcame us ”
the intercession of the intercessors will not avail them
fleeing away from a lion
fleeing from a lion
fleeing from a lion
nay every man of them desires to be given scrolls unrolled
no indeed but they do not fear the hereafter
never so as this is a reminder
let him then who heeds remember it
and they will not remember except as god wills
he is the benevolent evermerciful
i call to witness the day of resurrection
and the soul forbid from evil –
does man think we shall not put his bones together
yes indeed we can properly make all his phalanxes
but man is sceptical of what they have been doing
asking when shall be the day of resurrection
and the moon will be eclipsed
and the moon will be eclipsed
and the sun and moon are conjoined
on that day man will say where can i find no place where can
never there is no refuge
upon that day the recourse shall be to thy lord
on that day man will be informed of all what he sent ahead and left behind
in fact man is a witness against himself
whatever the excuses he may offer
do not forestall the revelation before its completion by acting in haste
indeed assembling the qur’an and reading it are upon us
so when we have read it you should thereupon follow what is read
then indeed to explain its details to you is upon us
no indeed but you prefer the life of this world
and leave be the hereafter
on that day some faces will shine with freshness
who give whatsoever they give in his way and go to their lord
many faces will that day be bright
who when they commit an indecency they turn away from god
yes indeed when the soul will reach up to the throat
and it is asked is there any reciter of charms and amulets
and he will realise that this is the parting
and those that draw out violently
upon that day unto thy lord shall be the driving
neither did he believe it to be true nor did he offer the prayer
but he denied and turned away
then he went to his home in pride
your ruin has come close still closer
your ruin has come close still closer
does man think that he will be left alone to himself free
was he not an emitted drop of semen
then formed into an embryo then he fashioned shaped and proportioned
and of that created two kinds male and female
what is he not able to quicken the dead
and was there not a thing that brought awaits him to a man
indeed we have created man from mixed semen in order to test him – we therefore made him hearing knowing
we surely showed him the way that he may either be grateful or deny
we have prepared for unbelievers chains and collars and a blazing fire
indeed the virtuous will drink from a cup containing a mixture of kafoor
this is from the spring of which the votaries of god will drink and make it flow in abundance
they fulfil their vows and fear a day whose evil is upon the wing
and they love not the love of him and the needy the orphan the captive
we feed you only for the face of god we desire no recompense from you
we fear the dismal day calamitous from our lord
so god saved them from the evil of that day and made them freshness and joy
and gave the reward for the virtuous and the highest reward for the best of all
reclining in it upon thrones they will not see the hot sunshine in it nor the bitter cold
the shadows will bend over them and low will hang the clusters of grapes
passed round will be silver flagons and goblets made of glass
and crystal clear bottles of silver of which they will determine the measure themselves
and in paradise they will be given to drink cups filled with a mixture of ginger
a fountain from which only they who are honoured drink
cups of wine will be presented to them in rounds from a spring flowing in front of them
when you look around you will see delights and great dominion
in it they adorn clothes of fine green silk and gold embroidery and they are given silver bracelets to wear and their lord gave them pure wine to drink
their lord heard them of their patient
this is the expiation for an eye and an excuse
we have revealed the quran to you gradually
so be thou patient under the judgment of thy lord and obey not one of them sinner or unbeliever
and remember the name of your lord morning and evening
and proclaim his purity during the night and at the ends of the day and the stars bow in homage
surely these men love what they have been doing
we created them and fixed their bones and joints and we could replace them when we like with others like them
this is indeed an advice so whoever wishes may take the path towards his lord
but you will not desire except as god wills
god is allknowing and allwise
he admits whosoever he will to his benevolence
but for the evildoers he has prepared a painful punishment
then by those that clearly differentiate the right and wrong
and those that strike violently
and those that revive by quickening
and those that distinguish distinctly
and those hurling a reminder
or to bring to life or to death or that he may either be lost or removing the souls good
indeed what you are promised will surely befall
when the stars are obliterated
when the sky is split asunder
when the mountains shall be scattered
and when the time comes for raising the little girls buried alive
for what day is that time fixed
for the day of decision
and what shall teach thee what is the day of decision
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not destroy the ancients
we shall then send the latter after them
that is how we deal with sinners
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not create you from an abject fluid
then made him a drop of fluid in a secure shelter
for a certain appointed time
so it is we have made the promise to you
how well do we calculate
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not make the earth a storehouse
for the living and the dead among you
and placed in it lofty and broad stablisers and gave you sweet water to drink
ruin is for the deniers on that day
depart to that you cried was lies
depart to a triplemassing shadow
unshading against the blazing flame
indeed hell throws up sparks like huge castles
so like golden camels
ruin is for the deniers on that day
they will not be able to speak that day
nor given leave to make excuses
ruin is for the deniers on that day
on that day he shall gather you all together and the people before him
if you do not desist i shall have more
ruin is for the deniers on that day
indeed allah will admit the pious with the fire –
and such fruits as they desire
eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you were working
that is how we reward the good
ruin is for the deniers on that day
eat and drink enjoy for a while
you will surely be sinners
ruin is for the deniers on that day
and when it is said to them “ offer the prayer ” – they do not
ruin is for the deniers on that day
in what manner of discourse then will they after this believe
of what are they asking one another
about the great tidings
about which they have been differing
again surely yes they will soon come to know
no indeed they shall soon know
did we not make the earth a spreading
and the mountains as pegs
and it is we who created you in pairs
and made your sleep a rest
and made the night a cover
and made the day for seeking livelihood
and built seven strong roofs above you
and we appointed a blazing lamp
and we sent down rain down from waterladen clouds pouring in torrents
that we may bring forth thereby grain and plants
and orchards full of trees and interlacing boughs
surely a time is fixed for the day of judgement
the day when the trumpet will be blown – you will therefore come forth in multitudes
the heavens will be opened wide and turn into so many doors
and the mountains are set in motion and become a vapour
and hell made visible to him who can see
the destination of the rebellious
where they will remain for aeons
finding neither sleep nor any thing to drink
except boiling water and benumbing cold
a fitting reward
they were those who did not expect a reckoning
and they denied our signs to the extreme
and we have kept recorded everything in a book accounted for
so now taste the punishment
so will the warner come to you suddenly and you shall not increase anything for except in chastisement
surely for those who fear god and follow the straight path shall be amidst gardens and bliss
gardens and grapes
and maidens of a single age
and flasks full and flowing
in which they will remain forever neither will they be helped
a recompense from your lord a sufficient gift
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them most benevolent to whom none may dare address a word
the day when jibreel and all the angels will stand in rows none will be able to speak except one whom the most gracious commands and who spoke rightly
that day is certain
so whosoever likes may prepare a way to his lord
we have indeed warned you of a calamity near at hand a day when man will see what he had sent of his deeds ahead and the disbelievers will say “ alas if only i were dust ”
i call to witness those who dive and drag
and those that draw out violently
and those that glide swimmingly
and who quickly present themselves
then those that distribute it by command
the day the convulsive first blast shatters convulsively
and the second blast follows it
many a heart will flutter on that day
unable to lift their gaze
they say shall we go back to our original state
what when we are bones old and wasted
the unbelievers say this is a plot
it was only one cry and lo they are the warners
so they will immediately be in an open plain
hast thou received the story of moses
when his lord called him in the holy valley of tuwa
go to pharaoh he has waxed insolent
and say hast thou the will to purify thyself
‘ and i may guide you to your lord so that you may fear ’ ”
so moosa showed him the magnificent sign
but he cried lies and rebelled
he then turned away striving in his effort
and assembled his council and proclaimed
saying i am alone your lord the highest of them all
so god seized him for the punishment of the hereafter and this world
surely in that is a sign for him who takes heed for themselves
do you think that it is harder to create you or the heavens
god has created it
he raised its roof and made it proper
and he made its night dark and started its light
and afterwards spread out the earth
and from it produced its water and its pasture
and solidified the mountains
in order to benefit you and your cattle
about the great tidings
upon that day man shall remember what he has striven
and hell made visible to him who can see
then as for him who was insolent
and preferred the worldly life
will surely have hell for his abode
and remember your lord within your hearts humbly and with fear and softly with him
then indeed paradise only is his destination
they ask you when will the hour be when is its time fixed
what art thou about to mention it
towards your lord only is its conclusion
you are but a herald of warning for one who fears it
when they see it nigh at night or they will drive it towards the day of resurrection then morning it will be fixed for them
he frowned and turned away
because a blind man had come in his august presence
and what should teach thee perchance he would cleanse him
or that he may accept advice so the advice may benefit him
for him who is care to him
you pay full attention
and what shall teach thee what is the pit
and for him who came to you striving
and is also fearful of god
you neglect
never so as this is a reminder
let him then who heeds remember it
exalted pure
exalted pure
written by the hands of emissaries
noble and pious
perish man
how unthankful he is
of what substance god created him
from a single sperm he created then proportioned him
then eased the way for him
then gave him death so had him put in the grave
then when he willed he brought him out as during the night of holy prophet ’s ascension when all the prophets gathered behind him in the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem or when allah will raise everyone on the day of resurrection
no indeed he has not fulfilled what was enjoined on him
let man consider his nourishment
we poured down rain abundantly
then we split the earth properly
thereby produced grain in it
and grapes and herbage
olives and dates
orchards thick with trees
and fruits and grass
in order to benefit you and your cattle
so when the deafening shout arrives
on that day man will run away from his brother
mother and father
as well as his wife and children
each man will have enough cares that day
many faces will that day be bright
laughing and full of joy
many a face will be glittering on that day
blackness overcoming them
they are the people who do not believe
when the sun is folded up
when the stars are obliterated
and when the mountains are driven
when the pregnant camels shall be neglected
and when wild animals are herded together
when the oceans begin to flow
when souls are reunited with the bodies
and the little girl buried alive is asked
upon what sin was she killed for
when the ledgers are laid open
when the heaven splits open
when hell is set ablaze
and paradise brought near
then every soul will know what it had prepared for itself
i call to witness the night star
the planets withdrawing into themselves
and the night when on the wane
and the morning when it is unveiled
and indeed it is a despair for the disbelievers
full of power wellestablished in position with the lord and master of the throne
throw down your staff
your companion is not possessed
he truly saw the clear horizon
he is not niggardly of the unseen
and remember allah is not the recitation of an intelligent son
so where are you going
it is but a reminder for all the people of the world
for those of you who desire to walk the path that is straight
though you can not desire except as god will the lord of all the worlds
when the sky is split asunder
when the stars are obliterated
when the oceans begin to flow
when the tombs are overthrown
then will they return into the terrible punishment
o man
who created you then formed your symmetry then gave you right proportion
who created you then formed your symmetry then gave you right proportion
shaping you into any form he pleased
not at all – but rather you deny the establishment of justice
and indeed there are some guardians over you
noble writers
knowing all what you may do
indeed the virtuous are in serenity
and indeed the sinners are in hell
they will burn in it on the day of judgement
they will not be able to escape from it
and what shall teach thee what is the day of doom
again what shall teach thee what is the day of doom
the day on which no soul will have the authority over any other soul and on that day the entire command belongs to allah
woe to the stinters who
who insist on being given full when they take from others
whilst when they measure for them give less
do they not think that they shall be raised up
unto a mighty day
the day all mankind and have to return to your lord the lord of all the worlds
never
do not follow the path of those who do not believe in the hereafter
surely your lord is the protector of the things you do
it is a repository of distinctly written record
ruin is for the deniers on that day
who call the day of judgement a lie
and none cries lies to it but every guilty aggressor
when our signs are recited to him he says fairytales of the ancients
never
in fact the disbelievers have misled them from the land
no indeed but upon that day the station of his lord
then they shall roast at hell
and told this is the fire which you denied
never
surely the ledger of the pious will be in illiyun heights above the heights
and what shall teach thee what is the pit
it is a repository of distinctly written record
witnessed by those who are honoured
surely the pious shall be in bliss
on couches face to face
on their faces you will see the glow of beatitude
they will be given pure wine to drink which is kept preserved sealed
with a sealing of musk which those who aspire for the best should desire
blended with the water of tasnim heights ultimate of evolution
a fountain from which only they who are honoured drink
indeed the guilty used to laugh at the believers
and winked at one another as they passed by them
and whilst returning to their homes they used to return rejoicing
and upon seeing the muslims they used to say “ indeed they have gone astray ”
but they were not sent to be guardians over them
so the believers will laugh at the infidels on that day
on high thrones watching
did not the disbelievers get repaid for what they used to do
when the sky is split asunder
and hearkens to its lord and is dutiful
when the earth shall be rocked
and casts forth what is in it and voids itself
and hearkens to its lord and is dutiful
o man you have to strive o man do so then go on striving towards your lord
and he who is given his ledger in his right hand
will have an easy reckoning
and will return to his people full of joy
but as for him who is given his book behind his back
will pray for death
and will go into the blazing fire
he lived rejoicing among his people
never thinking he will return
never
surely yes why not indeed his lord is seeing him
i call to witness the mount sinai
and the night and all it gathers
and the moon when at the all
that you will climb from stage to stage
what is the matter with them that they do not accept faith
and when the quran is recited to them bow thyself
in fact the disbelievers keep denying
god knows what they hide in their hearts
so give them the glad tidings of a painful punishment
except those who believe and do righteous deeds
there is perpetual punishment for them
i call to witness the sky bespangled with the signs of the zodiac
and the promised day
and the witness and the witnessed
the fire abounding in fuel
the fire abounding in fuel
they are the people of hell
witnessing what they had done to the believers
they were the idolaters and god was most exalted most high
whose kingdom spreads over the heavens and the earth
god is witness over everything
surely for those who persecute believers men and women and do not repent afterwards is the punishment of hell and for them is the punishment of hell
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow – in it they will abide for ever
this will be the great achievement of success
indeed the seizure of your lord is very severe
and that it is he who creates the dead then reverts it
and he is the allforgiving the allloving
the lord of the glorious throne
performer of what he desires
did the story of the armies reach you
did the story of the armies reach you
nay but the unbelievers still cry lies
and allah is after them has them surrounded
nay but it is a glorious koran
in the preserved tablet
i call to witness the heavens and the night star
and what shall teach thee what is the pit
it is the star that shines with a piercing brightness
there is not a soul that does not have a guardian over it
let man consider what he was made of
he was created of gushing water
issuing from the pelvis between the backbone and the ribs
god has certainly power to bring him back from the dead
the day when the secrets will be examined
so man will have no friend today against a friend or helper
i call to witness the sky bespangled with the signs of the zodiac
and the earth which opens up with verdure
that this quran is a decisive word
and no trifle
they are hatching up a plot
and yet i too am devising guile
so bear with unbelievers with patience and give them respite for a while
glorify the name of your lord most high
who creates and proportions
who determines and directs
who brings out the pastures
then reduces them to rusty rubbish
we shall make you recite the quran so that you will not forget it
unless god may please
he knows the visible and knows what is hidden
and we shall create the means of ease for you
therefore advise indeed you are a proclaimer of advice
god warns you that you beware of him and those who fear him who will take heed
and the most wicked will stay away from it
who will burn in the terrible fire
then he shall neither die nor live
surely he will succeed who grows in goodness
and who mentioned the name of his lord then offered prayer
no indeed but you prefer the present life
and that which is the best with god is better and more lasting
indeed this is in the former scriptures
moses said all of you are not in it
did the story of the armies reach you
many faces will be contrite on that day
labouring wearied out
burning in the scorching fire
watered at a boiling fountain
there is nothing but a cup one to another
which neither give strength nor satisfy the hunger
many faces will be contrite on that day
wellpleased with their endeavour
in the high empyrean
never hearing idle talk
in it is a flowing spring
in which are high thrones
goblets set
cushions arranged
and linen spread out
do they not then ponder how the clouds were formed
and the heaven – how it has been raised
and the mountains – how they have been established
and the earth how it was spread out
therefore advise indeed you are a proclaimer of advice
you are not at all a guardian over them
except whoever turns away and disbelieves –
allah will mete out to him the greatest punishment
surely unto us is their return
then indeed only upon us is their reckoning
i call to witness the dawn
and the ten nights
and by oath of the even and the odd
and the night when on the wane
is there not an evidence in this for those who have sense
did you not see how did your lord deal with the tribe of aad
and the tribe of thamud who hewed rocks in the valley
like whom no one else was born in the cities
and the tribe of thamud who hewed rocks in the valley
and the mighty pharaoh
who terrorised the region
and multiplied corruption
so your lord poured a scourge of punishment over them
surely thy lord is allclement allcompassionate
and when man is gracious to him he says my lord has given him much as a favour from him he says my lord has given me a garden of eden
but if his lord had pleased him could have taken him as a garden of bliss
no indeed but you honour not the orphan
and do not urge one another to feed the poor
and you readily devour the inheritance with greed
and love wealth with all your heart
and indeed when the earth is spread out a thing creation
and angels row on row and row on row
hell is the refuge of gehenna that day
and on that day man will remember what he strove for
if only they had done evil good deeds he would have done it to me
upon that day none shall chastise as he chastises
and no one binds like he does
o soul at peace
return unto thy lord wellpleased wellpleasing
enter then among my votaries
enter thou my paradise
i call this earth to witness
and you are free to live upon it
and the parent and the offspring
we have indeed created man surrounded by hardships
does he think that no one sees him
he says i have wasted a great deal of wealth
does he think that no one sees him
did we not give him two eyes
one tongue and two lips
and showed him two highways of good and evil
but he could not scale the steep ascent
and what have you understood what the valley is
the freeing of a slave
or to feed in times of famine
of a related orphan
or to feed in times of famine
then that he become of those who believe and counsel each other to be steadfast and counsel each other to be merciful
these are the people of the right hand and will succeed
and those who disbelieve in our signs they are the companions of the left hand
burning in the scorching fire
i call to witness the sun and his early morning splendour
and the moon will be eclipsed
and by oath of the day when it reveals it
the night when it covers him over
the heavens and its architecture
and by oath of the earth and by oath of him who spread it
and by oath of the soul and by oath of him who made it proper
and inspired it to lewdness and godfearing
he who nourishes it will surely be successful
and he who confines it will surely come to grief
the thamud denied the truth in their perverseness
when the most wretched of them uprose
then the apostle of god had cut off his council and the messenger of god then said come to them to fight with running water
but they called him a liar and hamstrung her
so god obliterated them for their crime and destroyed all of them alike
and he fears not the issue thereof
i call the night to witness when it covers over
and the day when it shines in all its glory
and by oath of the one who created the male and the female
that your endeavour is for different ends
and is intractable in his love of worldly goods
and believed the best matter to be true
we shall ease the way of fortune for him
and for him who hoarded wealth and remained carefree
and denied the best matter
we shall surely ease him to the hardship
his wealth will not avail him when he falls into ruin
indeed guiding is upon us
and to us belong the end and the beginning
i therefore warn you of the fire that is ablaze
none but the most wretched shall enter it except the most wretched
who denied the truth and turned away
and he who ordains death and life to the sake of allah is most appreciative rewards virtue
who gives his wealth in order to be pure
and no one can have done a favour which he should have a place of refuge and a great deal
other than seeking the glory of his lord most high
soon he shall know the very soon
i call to witness the early hours of morning
and the ten nights
your lord has neither left you nor despises you
and undoubtedly the latter is better for you than the former
your lord will certainly give you and you will be content
did he not find you an orphan so provided you shelter
did he not find you perplexed and show you the way
did he not find you poor and enrich you
do not oppress the orphan
and do not rebuke the beggar
and abundantly proclaim the favours of your lord
did we not widen your bosom
and lift from thee thy burden
which had left you devoid of hope
and exalted your fame
indeed with hardship is ease
indeed with hardship is ease
so when you are free work diligently
and incline towards your lord
i call to witness the fig and the olive
the mount sinai
and this land secure
we have indeed created man in the best shape
then brought him down to the lowest of the low
except those who believe and do righteous deeds
there is perpetual reward for them
in what manner of discourse then will you then believe after this
is not allah the greatest judge upon all judges
read with the name of your lord who created
created man from an embryo
read for your lord is most beneficent
who taught by the pen
taught man what he did not know
yes indeed man is surely rebellious
for he thinks himself selfsufficient
surely your returning is to your lord
what thinkest thou he who forbids
a votary when he turns to his devotions
what thinkest thou if he cries lies to the straight path
or bade to godfearing
say what think you if god were to guide him out of the right hand or helper
did not god not know that god sees
yes certainly if he does not desist we will seize him by the forelock
that the sinners will surely be in error
so let him call on his concourse
we shall call the guards of hell
no indeed do thou not obey him
command of prostration 14
truly we revealed it on the night of determination
and what shall teach thee what is the night of power
the night of power is better than a thousand months
in it descend the angels and jibreel by the command of your lord – for all works
it is peace till the dawning of the day
the unbelievers of the people of the book and the idolaters would never have been freed from false beliefs until the clear proof came to them
a messenger from god reciting pages purified
and indeed we gave moosa the clear proof from him a clear proof and a clear proof against mankind
those who were given the book were not one to change the word of god clear proof
but god with devotion allexclusive faith in him
this is the straight reckoning
and the unbelievers among the people of the book and the idolaters will abide in the fire of hell
they are the worst of creatures
but those who believe and do righteous deeds are the inhabitants of paradise
their reward is with their lord and gardens with everlasting stay in eden beneath which rivers flow – in it they are the greatest favours of allah
god will accept them and they will be gratified in obeying him
and that for one who fears his lord
when the earth is shaken with its appointed tremor
and the earth throws out its burdens
and man enquires what has come over it
on that day earth will narrate its news
for your lord will have commanded it
men will be segregated on that day
and whoso has done an atoms weight of good shall see it
and whoso has done an atoms weight of good shall see it
i call to witness those who dive and drag
then those striking sparks of fire
and those that draw out violently
blazing a trail of dust
penetrating deep into the armies
indeed man is very ungrateful towards his lord
and is himself witness to it
surely he is passionate in his love for good things
does he not know when the contents of the graves are laid bare
and the secrets of the hearts exposed
surely their lord will be aware of their deeds
what is the startling calamity
what is the startling calamity
and what shall teach thee what is the indubitable
the day when men will be like scattered moths
and mountains will be like flying wool
then he whose deeds shall weigh heavier in the scale
he is therefore in the desired serenity
and for one whose scales prove heavy
his paternal uncle
and what shall teach thee what is illiyun
a blazing fire
the avarice of plenitude keeps you occupied
until you confronted the graves
yes certainly you will soon realise
yes certainly you will soon realise
yes certainly if you can understand
you have indeed to behold hell
again indeed you will see it with certainty
then on that day you will surely be asked about the verity of pleasures
time and age are witness
surely man is in the way of loss
except those who believe and do righteous deeds and counsel each other to be steadfast and counsel each other to be merciful
ruin is for every open slanderer backbiter
woe to every slanderer backbiter
does he think that his wealth will prolong his stay on earth forever
no indeed he shall be thrust into the crusher
and what shall teach thee what is illiyun
the fire of allah that is ablaze
the fire of allah that is ablaze
indeed it will be shut over them
in extended columns
hast thou not seen how thy lord did with the men of the elephant
did he not put their scheme into ruin
and sent hordes of chargers flying against them
hurling against them stones of baked clay
so god turned them into pastured disgraced them
peace be on you
united to fit out caravans winter and summer
so these are the angels of worship – the lord of this house at all those who are related by our lord
god has given them the means of hunger and bestowed them safety from a great favour
have you seen him who denies the day of judgement
it is he who pushes the orphan away
and urges not the feeding of the needy
woe to those who pray
and are heedless of their prayers
those who make a display of their deeds
and withhold things of common use from others
surely we have given thee abundance
so offer the prayers for your lord and perform the sacrifice
indeed the virtuous are in error
say o you unbelievers
i do not worship what you worship
nor will you worship who i worship
i do not worship what you worship
nor will you worship who i worship
to you your way to me my way
and when the prophet confided to the two of one another then you will come to him your lord turning to him in repentance indeed he is most merciful
and you see men enter gods discipline horde on horde
and proclaim the praise of thy lord and seek his forgiveness for the sins of thy sins
he is certainly forgiving and kind
perish the hands of abu lahab and perish he
his wealth did not benefit him in the least nor did whatever he earned
he will roast at a flaming fire
and his wife the carrier of the firewood
will have a strap of fibre rope around her neck
say he is god one
god has power over everything
he has begotten no one and is begotten of none
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
say i seek refuge with the lord of rising day
and the evil of evening darkness when it overspreads
and the evil of evening darkness when it overspreads
from the evil of sorceresses who blow incantations on knots
from the evil of the envier when he envies
say i seek refuge with the lord of men
the king of men
the god of men
from the evil of what he has created
“ those who instil evil thoughts into the hearts of men ”
from among the jinns and men
all praise be to allah lord of all the worlds
most beneficent evermerciful
owner of the day of recompense
you alone we worship and to you alone turn for help
guide us on the straight path
the path of those you have blessed not of those who have earned your anger nor those who have gone astray
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
this is a clear declaration for mankind and a guidance and a mercy for those who preserve themselves from evil
who believe in the unknown and fulfil their devotional obligations and spend in charity of what we have given them
who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you and what was revealed to you and believe in the hereafter
they are on guidance from their lord and will prosper
they are the people who will prosper
as for those who disbelieve it is all the same they will not believe
god has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing and on their eyes fail
for them is great suffering
and among men there are some that say we believe in god and the last day in reality do not believe
they think they are the believers and ears and eyes and god has knowledge of everything but they do not know
sick are their hearts and god adds to their malady
for them there is painful punishment for their disbelief
when asked to desist from spreading corruption in the land they say why we are reformers
truly they are the workers of corruption but they are not aware
and when it is said to them “ believe as the others believe ” they say “ shall we believe as the foolish believe ”
truly they are the workers of corruption but they are not aware
when they meet the faithful they say we believe but when alone with the devils their fellows they say we are really with you we were joking
god shall mock them and shall lead them on blindly wandering in their insolence
they are those who bartered away good guidance for error and did not increase the way of guidance for error and they are rightguided
the semblance of them is that of a man who shouts to one that can not hear the call of a call and a cry deaf dumb when they discuss such partners to god does not mislead the people who have no sense
deaf dumb and blind and they are not to return
or he who shows the lightning water from the sky and sends down hail from the sky where there are mountains for them and they are mountains of it
verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes
when it flashes forth they walk in its flare when darkness returns they stand still
and if allah wills so he wills and leaves them – like hills – so it is likely that allah will put it down they are all knowing
surely god has power over all things
o you people adore your lord who created you as he did those before you that you could take heed for yourselves and fear him who created you and hope for the transgressors
who made the earth a bed for you the sky a canopy and sends forth rain from the skies that fruits may grow your food and sustenance
so do not make another the equal of god knowingly
and if you are in doubt concerning what we have sent down upon our distinguished bondman prophet bring forth a single surah like it if you are truthful
and if you can not as indeed you can not then guard yourselves against the fire whose fuel is men and rocks which has been prepared for disbelievers
so those who believed and did good deeds – for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow
they shall have what they wish and shall live there abidingly
god is not ashamed to strike a similitude even of a gnat or aught above it
those who believe say god has indeed made the truth among the believers who disbelieve say what does god mean by this parable
thereby he leads many astray and thereby he guides many and thereby he leads none astray save him from the path
those who break the covenant of allah after ratifying it – and sever what allah has ordered to join and who cause turmoil evil religious chaos in the earth it is they who are the losers
then how can you disbelieve in god he gave you life to life and inquired how long did you do
then he will give you life to the dead and he will give you death and he will make you die
he created for you all that lies within the earth then turning to the firmament he proportioned several skies he has knowledge of everything
he is allknowing and allpowerful
and when thy lord said to the angels i am setting in the earth a viceroy from clay and do thou take refuge in god and do thou serve
and god said i know what you do not know
adam learnt them if you are truthful
they said glory be to thee
we do not have any knowledge except what you have taught us
indeed you only are the all knowing the wise ”
and said adam he truly i said to them o adam
and when he had told them their names he said i know what you know not
and when we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
then he conceived a fear of the mighty device
and we said o adam
and we said adam both you and your spouse live in the garden eat freely to your fill wheresoever you like but approach not this tree or you will become iniquitous
we said “ o lut
and we said to him dwell in the earth for a while
then adam learnt from his lord certain words of revelation therefore allah accepted his repentance indeed he only is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful
surely he turned towards him and is allcompassionate
we said to them go down out of it out of hell and shall find no fear upon them nor shall they sorrow
and those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell
they will abide in them for ever
o descendants of israel jacob
remember my favour which i bestowed upon you and fulfil your covenant towards me i shall fulfil my covenant towards you and fear me alone
and believe in it and do not be the first part of those who believe in it and do not believe in it and do not be the people who do not believe in it and do not believe in it and fear me
and do not mix the truth with falsehood nor purposely conceal the truth
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and bow with those that bow
would you bid others to piety and forget yourselves while you recite the way
do you not understand
and seek help in patience and prayer surely god is gracious to all patiently enduring
who know that they have to meet their lord and that it is to him they are to return
o descendants of israel jacob
remember the favour of mine which i bestowed upon you and made you superior to all others of your time by sending noble messengers among you
and beware of the day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction and no intercession shall be accepted from it nor any counterpoise be taken neither shall they be helped
and remember when we rescued you from firaun ’s people who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters and in it was a great favour from your lord
and when we split the sea for you thereby rescuing you and drowned the firauns people in front of your eyes
and moses said to his people you took as for a calf after him and make an ample recompense those who earned after him
then after that we pardoned you so that you may be grateful
and we gave moses the book and discernment of falsehood and truth that you may be guided
and moosa said to his people “ o my people
and indeed it is the same you were unjust – in the sight of allah – you commit the same way you bondmen ”
this is best for you you may haply take heed for yourselves
surely he turned towards him and is allcompassionate
and when you said “ o moosa
we will not believe you until we see when we see you are promised – blind and the thunderbolt took you for a while
then we brought you back to life after your death so that you may be grateful
and we outspread the cloud to overshadow you and we sent down manna and quails upon you eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you and quails upon you eat of the good things we have provided and they eat of it but god has provided and
and we said enter this city eat and eat easefully of it wherever you will and enter in at the gate if you like any other but draw nigh in it
we shall give more excellence to those who do good
but the unjust changed the word that had been ordered for another one so we sent down on them a punishment from the skies the recompense of their disobedience
and when moses said to his people o my people what do you take to yourselves out of the earth a covenant from the sky
and when moosa asked for water for his people asked for water strike with rock and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains all the people turned out examples for themselves stayed in the fire and they remain dejected
eat and drink enjoy gods gifts and spread no discord in the land
and when you said “ o moosa
we have not told one to eat of its fruits and drinks so that you may not find the fruits of all things
he said you are better than a people who are believers
and told go to the one you to get your recompense with your own hands
they will be in the land and there will be no escape
that is because they denied the signs of god and killed the prophets unjustly and rebelled and went beyond the limit
evil was that they were forging
indeed those who accepted faith and the jews and the christians – their seed and the sabeans and the good deeds and the christians – so there shall be no fear upon them neither shall they grieve
remember the day we made the covenant with you and exalted you on the mount and said hold fast to what we have given you and remember what is in it that you may attain piety
then after that you turned away and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you you would be among the losers
and what shall teach thee what is the day of resurrection
and we made it a reminder for those who fear and a reminder to the godfearing
and moses said to his people god commands you to preservation or make fun of us
he said god forbid that i should be of the ignorant
call on your lord for us they said that he might inform us what kind she should be
he said “ my prayers ” and completed my tongue – so the distance between the spectacle and the beloved of his bondmen and the one was a big or small sin ”
call on your lord for us they said that he might inform us what kind she should be
he says she shall be a golden cow bright her colour gladdening the beholders
the event that terrifies the hearts
call on your lord for us they said that he might inform us what kind she should be
they said “ if allah wills we are truthful ”
he said “ allah says ‘ do not create anything for you – he has no right to occur ”
they said “ they have brought the truth to us
they said “ you have lost us and have no right to be ungrateful ”
and remember when you slew a man and disputed thereon and god disclosed what you were hiding
we had pronounced already slay the murderer for taking a life
so does god make the dead to life and shows you his signs that you may understand
then after this is your hearts so like the fate of those who are ruined
with two streams of water flowing through them both can not water the sweet water to drink and rivers flowing through them and sweet and fresh springs of water
and god is allsufficient alllaudable
and god is aware of all that you do
so do you believe a part of them who heard a cause whereas allah heard the wondrous quran
and when they meet the believers they say “ we believe ” but when they go privily with their necks they say “ what
do you not understand
do they not know that allah knows all whatever they hide and whatever they disclose
and among them are the unlearned that do not know anything of the book except to recite something therefrom or parts of the book they only themselves whereas it is nothing but a certain truth
those who were given the book were given the book and they will say it is a little gain from god but a little did you know
so ruin is for disbelievers because of their own hands
say the fire is a touch if only they will not be able to not touch us except a number of days
and allah has commanded this promise – you do not know ”
and whoso earns evil and is encompassed by the transgression there awaits the fire the mighty chastisement
but those who believe and do righteous deeds are the inhabitants of paradise
they will abide in them for ever
and when allah took the taurat in the book and the salvation upon the devotion of prophethood and the people and the zakat and his parents and kinsmen orphans and the neighbours who speak kindly to people and the good things
then you turned away all but a few of you swerving aside
remember when we took a covenant from you that “ do not shed the blood of your own people nor turn out your own people from your colonies ” you then acknowledged it and you are witnesses
then you will be told your witness god and you will be witness
then you will become arrogant and you will find peace among you and kill one another and you turn disbelievers in their homes
do you then believe a part of the book and reject a part
and the punishment of the day of judgement is but a sport and on the day of resurrection you will fully aware of the things you do
they are the people who bought the worldly life in exchange of the hereafter and because the wealth of the world to come
so they will neither be able to escape from their pardon and none will help them
we have indeed sent down the book to moosa and the judgement after him
even so did a noble messenger come to you with a people turn away from it
and they say our hearts are uncircumcised
in fact allah has cursed them for their unbelief
and they will not accept faith
and when the book was sent to them by god verifying what had been revealed to them already even though before it they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers
then god shall those who disbelieve the sinners shall be mustered
god is gracious to his creatures his apostle the kingdom and the wisdom of those who do not believe in what he please and what they hoard
so they deserved wrath upon wrath and the disbelievers is a disgraceful punishment
the punishment for disbelievers is ignominious
and when it is said to them believe in what god has sent down they say we believe what was sent down they possess no other true but we believe what was sent down
and when they are recited to them they say this is the truth confirming what is before it
say why then were you slaying the prophets of god in former time if you were believers
and moses came to you with the clear signs then you took to yourselves the calf after him and you were evildoers
and when we took compact with you and raised over you the mount take forcefully what we have given you and give ear
they said we have heard and obey shuaib they said we hear and their cry lies
say vile is your belief if you are believers indeed
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ if the abode of the hereafter in the sight of allah is for you alone and none else then long for death if you are truthful ”
and they will not be wronged themselves for what they earned
but god knows who are the wicked
and thou shalt find the eagerest of men for life and god is more powerful than those who are idolaters
if every one of them is a hundred will not go forth except to waste
and they shall not know its punishment from the hereafter
god sees the things you do
say “ what is your opinion – regarding the qur’an guides to him who has sent down the book upon his which he sent down the book and the salvation and a guidance and a light and a clear explanation ”
whosoever is an enemy to god and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael surely god is an enemy to the unbelievers
we have indeed sent down to you clear signs and none will disbelieve in them except the sinners
is it a covering of believers
nay but the most of them are unbelievers
and when there has come to them a messenger from allah confirming what was with their hearts that were before it they said “ if you obey allah ” then they set in their hearts a seal is not at all beware
and they followed what the satans recited over solomons kingdom
solomon disbelieved not but the satans doing heralds of error do not believe
they said we disbelieve but the two disputants who are unbelievers do not believe
it is not for any soul to bring a soul save by its leave and god is swift at the reckoning
they knew indeed whoever bought this had no place in the world to come
if they had no sense
had they come to believe instead and taken heed for themselves they would surely have earned from god a far better place
o believers do not say observe us but say do not say with the advantage of the days have superiority to us
and for the disbelievers there is painful punishment
those who disbelieve – the people given the books or the polytheists do not wish that good should come to you from your lord
in gods bounty is the bounty of god which he bestows on whosoever he please and the bounty of god is infinite
and when we cancel a message sent to an earlier prophet or throw it into oblivion we replace it with one better or one similar
did you not know that allah has the power over all things
do you not know that allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and there is none to save them from allah
do you too o moses do you too o moses or hear your revelation or too moses
whoso exchanges belief for unbelief has surely strayed from the right way
many of the people of the book who disbelieve after the clear signs had come to you when you believed and disbelieve after the clear signs had come to them
and you went away for god to fight them until they confront a day that was unconcerned
surely god has power over all things
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and lend to piety
surely god sees the things you do
and they say the jews or christians shall be christians
such are their fancies
say produce your proof if you speak truly
yes why not whoever submits his will to his lord and does good deeds and is virtuous his reward is with his lord and no fear shall be on them neither shall they grieve
the jews say the christians stand not on anything the christians say the jews stand not on anything yet both read the book
and the ignorant say “ we are the same as if they are ”
god shall judge between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
and who is more unjust than one who prevents the name of allah being mentioned in the mosques and strives for their ruin
they were the jinn before them yet they did not speak except to one of them
for them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come
and the east and the west all belong to east and the west god is the allsufficient merciful
god has power over everything
and they said “ allah has taken an offspring for himself ” – purity is to him
glory be to him
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
all men honour and the refuge is certain to come
he created the heavens and the earth with reason
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
and they that know not say why does god not speak to us
so had others denied before them
like those before them who are also alike
but to those who believe our signs and make fun of us
we have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn
you will not be questioned about those and who are inmates of hell
the jews and christians are not the christians and the christians and they are not pleased with you nor are they pleased with you
say it is god who shows the way to the right way
and if you follow their caprices now that you have been given knowledge you will have no protector or helper
those to whom we have given the book read it in read it as it should be read believe in it truly but those who deny it will be losers
but those who disbelieve will be losers
o descendants of israel jacob
remember the favour of mine which i bestowed upon you and made you superior to all others of your time by sending noble messengers among you
so fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will they be set free in lieu of compensation nor will they be helped
remember when his lord tried abraham by a number of commands which he fulfilled god said to him
said allah “ indeed i shall make you a leader for the people
and remember when ibrahim prayed “ my lord
and god chose my pledge
so o men we have now rule the earth for all mankind and made the people who have sure faith
remember when we made a covenant with abraham and ishmael purify my house for those that cleave to it and ishmael thou wilt of those that cleave to it
and remember when ibrahim prayed “ my lord
and he said to his people “ appoint a city as a muslim men from the city who believe in allah and the last day and performs good deeds – so allah will then forgive them their sins and then give him of all things ”
remember when he was raising the plinth of the house with ishmael he prayed accept faith and prayed
and do not place on us a heavy burden responsibility as you did on those before us
indeed you only are the all hearing the all knowing ”
“ o our lord
and make us submissive to you and from our offspring and from your lord and give us a nation obedient to you – and give us the most of the offspring of the common people ”
you are the forgiving and merciful
“ o our lord
and among them is one who made a covenant from them the holy prophet ’s verses and blessings be upon him
you are allmighty and allwise
none except one who turns his face except the other therefore turn away from the remembrance of ibrahim
indeed we chose him ibrahim in this world and indeed in the hereafter he is among those worthy of being closest to us
when his lord said to him “ submit ” he said “ i have submitted to the lord of the creation ”
and abraham charged his sons with this and jacob likewise my sons god has chosen him over everything
and do not die but as your fathers or that god has surrendered you to belief
or do you think that he will be raised again and he will say “ my lord
they said we shall serve thy god and the god of thy fathers abraham ishmael and isaac one god to him we surrender
those were the people and they have passed away
theirs the reward for what they did as yours will be for what you do
you will not be questioned about their deeds
they say become jews or become christians and find the right way
say no we follow the way of abraham the upright who was not of idolaters
say god and what was sent down to us and what was sent down to abraham and ishmael isaac and jacob likewise jacob and the tribes jesus and job jonah and aaron and solomon and we have submitted to the prophets as we have accepted faith in you we
we make no distinction among them and we submit to him
if they come to believe as you did they will find the right path
so if they turn away then god suffices for a guardian
he is allhearing and allknowing
say who is the lord of ear and eye
him alone we worship
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ what you dispute with us concerning allah whereas he is our lord and your lord
our deeds are with us and with you are your deeds and only to us are our deeds
we are debtloaded
or do you claim that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and their offspring were jews or christians
say have you more knowledge than god
and who does greater evil than he who conceals the testimony received from god
and god is aware of all that you do
theirs the reward for what they did as yours will be for what you do
you will not be questioned about their deeds
the foolish will now ask and say what has made the faithful turn away from the qiblah towards which they used to pray
say to god belong the east and the west
he guides who so wills to the path that is straight
and so we have made you a witness over mankind and appointed you are the people as witness over them
we have decreed the qiblah which you faced before that we may know who follow the apostle and who turned away in haste
this was on guidance for the people of the right path
but god will not suffer your faith to go waste for god is to men full of mercy and grace for god is forgiving and kind
we have seen you turn your face to the heavens
so turn towards the holy mosque and turn towards it wherever you are turn your faces towards the sacred mosque
those who were given the book know it is the truth from their lord
and god is aware of all that you do
even though you bring all the proof to the people of the book they will not face the direction you turn to nor will they follow each others direction of theirs you will they face to face
and if you follow their whims after all the knowledge that has reached you then surely you will be among transgressors
those to whom we have given the book recognize it as they recognize their sons
yet there are a section among them conceals the truth knowingly
this is the truth from your lord so do not be one of those who doubt
each has a goal to which he turns so strive towards piety
wherever you may be god will bring you all together
surely god has power over all things
wherever you come from turn towards the holy mosque from turn towards the right path
this is the truth from your lord so believe not in it
and god is aware of all that you do
whichever term come from turn towards you from turn your face towards the holy mosque and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it therefore fear them not so that people may be prosper
as we have sent down to you a messenger from among you to recite our signs and to teach you the book and the wisdom and to make clear to you that you do not know
so remember me i will remember you and listen to me ”
so do not be one of those who are extravagant
o people who believe
and seek help in patience and prayer and truly it is hard except for god
god is with those who are patient and persevere
do not utter regarding those who are killed in allahs cause as they are dead in fact they are alive and are not aware
nay but you are not generous to the dead
and indeed we have heavy hearts in fear of fear of mighty and allwise and power and blessings be upon him and when he gave them the glad tidings of a generous reward
who when they are visited by an affliction say surely we belong to god and assuredly we are the godfearing
these are the people upon whom are the blessings from their lord and mercy and it is they who are on guidance
they are the people who are on guidance
truly safa and marwa are the symbols of god
safa and marwa are among the waymarks of god so whosoever makes the pilgrimage to the house or the visitation it is no fault in him to circumambulate them and whoso volunteers good god is allgrateful allknowing
and whosoever does righteousness being at a right settlement is better for god knows very well
those who conceal the clear signs and the guidance that we have sent down after the clear signs had come to them and will surely find the curse of god for them is cursed
except those who repent and do reform and disclose the truth
they are those who turned to god in repentance
i incline towards you and your lord indeed he is most acceptor of repentance most merciful
indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from allah ’s way and the angels stern ’s punishment – and they had died as disbelievers – and they had died of the prophets and all that allah is the curse of the world and of the angels and of the
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
it will not decrease for them dumb with despair they will stay in it
your god is one god there is no god but he the allmerciful the allcompassionate
and in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day and the mountains are signs for the intelligent to make trees and beasts and many an journey and beasts and many signs for a people who understand
and there is a way that are those who take protectors besides allah who are firm in devotion and fear allah and allah is severe in punishment for the great success
when those that were followed disown their followers and they see the chastisement and their cords are cut asunder
“ and if only we could return to earth and be among the muslims ”
and god shall show them their works and he shall not show them any way to hell
o mankind
eat of the things of the earth and do not follow the footsteps of the devil undoubtedly he is your open enemy
he is your open enemy
he will ask you to indulge in evil indecency and to speak lies of god you can not even conceive
and when it is said to them follow what god has sent down they say no but we will follow such things as we found our fathers doing what
and if their forefathers had no intelligence or guidance
the semblance of the infidels is that of a man who shouts to one that can not hear more than a call and a cry
they are deaf dumb and blind and they fail to understand
o people who believe
eat of the good things we have provided you and be grateful to god if it be him that you serve
these things only he has forbidden you carrion blood the flesh of swine what has been hallowed to other than god
and whosoever is constrained not desiring nor transgressing no sin shall be on his own company of them
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
those who conceal the book and the fire god leads astray and they shall not share in the fire as protectors to him they shall be exposed to the fire
god will judge between them on the day of resurrection nor regret
for them there is painful punishment
they are the people who purchased error in exchange of guidance and torment in exchange of pardon so how much can they bear the fire
how evil the end of the workers of corruption
that is because god has sent down the book with the truth
indeed those who caused the book are in doubt concerning the book are the far error
and when you have accepted the prayer and pay the charity and the day of resurrection it is a protector or that he may pay the zakat and purified the good deeds
they are the truthful and sincere
those are the godfearing and the godfearing
o people who believe
o believers prescribed for you is retaliation touching the slain freeman for freeman slave for slave female for female
and whoever is slain regarding his own soul should desire to set up promises and follows her we have no scribe should be brother
this is a concession from your lord and a kindness
whoso transgresses in spite of it shall suffer painful punishment
in retribution there is life and preservation
it is ordained that when any one of you nears death and he owns goods and chattels he should bequeath them equitably to his parents and next of kin and do not walk in the least
this is binding on those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
and whosoever has done evil shall remember it shall be guilty of sin
verily god hears all and sees everything
and there is no sin on those who hurt another people shall not be guilty of sin
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o people who believe
o believers prescribed for you is prescribed for those of you who were before you haply so you will find the way to be godfearing
but if you are sick or on a journey then a number of days and for those who have no means should fast for you but do not have a just fasting is made compulsory for those who can not find another must fast for you so that you
ramadan is the month in which was sent down the qur’an and the clear proof of the guidance and the clear criteria to judge between right and wrong so whoever does not wish for the wrong will be repaid for the wrong from wrong
but if he finds not the means let him fast two successive months gods turning a complete ten days
so god makes clear to you his signs haply you will be guided
when my devotees enquire of you about me i am near and answer the call of every supplicant when he calls
enter thou among my servants
permitted to you is the night of the fast of the fast of pilgrimage
leaving the consorts your lord has made for you
god knows the worth of your deeds and is clement
so eat of its fruits and spend your sustenance and give you a time to the extent that when you will be fully accepted faith
then it is so as they keep away from women
these are the limits set by god and do not exceed the bounds set by god
so does god make his signs clear to men that they may take heed for themselves
do not unjustly devour the property of each other except through trade by mutual agreement and do not kill one another indeed allah is most merciful upon you
they ask you of the new moons
piety does not lie in entering the house through the back door for the pious man is he who follows the straight path
enter the house through the main gate and obey god you may haply find success
fight those in the way of god who fight you but do not be aggressive god does not like aggressors
god does not love transgressors
and slay them wherever you come upon them and expel them from where they expelled you persecution is more grievous than slaying
do not fight them by the holy mosque unless they fight you there so do not fight you in the end and fight them slay them wherever you find them
this is the punishment for the disbelievers
if they desist then verily god is forgiving and kind
fight them till sedition comes to end and the law of god prevails
if they desist then cease to be hostile except against those who oppress
fighting during the holy month if the sanctity of the holy month is violated is just retribution
if one avenges himself after he has been wronged there is no way of blaming him
and fear god and remember that god is with the godfearing
and expend in the way of god and cast not yourselves by your own hands into destruction but be gooddoers god loves the gooddoers
do good to your parents and do good
verily god loves those who do good
perform the pilgrimage and holy visit umra to makkah in the service of god
but if you are prevented send an offering which you can afford as sacrifice and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice
but if you are sick or have ailment of the scalp preventing the shaving of hair then offer expiation by fasting or else giving alms or a sacrificial offering
when you have security then perform your acts of prayer befittingly and praying at fixed hours is prescribed for you
but if you are prevented send an offering which one of you is sick and on a journey then a number of days and those who do not have a just think that you fear allah knows your deeds
this applies to him whose family does not live near the holy mosque
and fear god and know that god is terrible in retribution
the pilgrimage is no fault in the appointed period for those apart from the pilgrimage but if one resolves to perform the pilgrimage and fear god and whosoever fears god
and the good you do shall be known to god
provide for the journey and the best of provisions is piety
so fear god o men possessed of minds
there is no fault in the bounty of your lord and the bounty of your lord
when you start from arafat in a concourse remember god at the monument that is sacred almashar alharam and remember him as he has shown you the way for in the olden days you were a people astray
yes were you in this fact you were disobedient
then move with the crowd impetuously and pray god to forgive you your sins for god is aware of the things you do
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and when you have completed your hajj rites remember allah as you used to remember your forefathers in fact more than that and among them is one nation of the other
our lord give us sufficient endurance in the life of this world
there is nothing in the world to come
and among them are some that say “ our lord
give us good in the world o lord to come and save us from the torment of fire ”
they are those they have no strength to escape
surely god is swift at reckoning
and remember when you were few of the night
and whosoever fears god having no fault in him to help him
and fear god and remember that unto him you shall be mustered
and some men there are whose desire the present life beside the world to come and god is a witness over all things that he is worthy of praise
but when he turns his back he hastens about the earth to do corruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock and god loves not corruption
and when it is said to him fear that god will ask him what is in his heart and fear him
hell is sufficient for you to be an evil destination
and there is a man who became rich yet allah has forgiven what is in your hearts so that he has forgiven these people are not at rest in it and allah is all hearing all knowing
o people who believe
enter islam in full – and do not follow the footsteps of the devil
he is your open enemy
but if you slip after the clear signs have come to you know then that god is allknowing allwise
do they look for aught else but god shall come to the angels and the prophets who are mountains
but all things rest with god in the end
ask the children of israel how many a clear sign we had given them
and whosoever changes the blessing of god after it god will find his messengers after he has pardoned it god is terrible in retribution
enamoured are the unbelievers of the life of this world and scoff at the faithful
the issue ultimate is to the godfearing on the day of resurrection
miracles occur through the friends of allah
mankind was only a nation and to warn mankind of the day before them that god may judge between men and their differences in between them
those to whom the book was sent down with the clear book the holy prophet after the clear proof came to them
god will judge between the believers touching their differences
god says what is in your hearts god will guide whom he will
do you think you will find your way to paradise even though you have not known what the others before you have gone through
and when they commit hardship that befalls them they pray to some of them they used to kill and say “ if allah wills ”
remember that god intervenes between man and his heart is the help of one
they ask you of what they should give
they ask you concerning the decree concerning the orphans the needy the wayfarers so that you make the neighbour who is made a thing and your parents and kinsmen and the traveller and those who desire to come to set aright is for god knows everything
and the good you do shall be known to god
enjoined on you is fighting and this you abhor
and allah knows whereas you do not know
tell them to fight in that month is a great sin
but those who disbelieve also gods way and obstruct others from the way of god is severe punishment
they will always seek war against you till they turn you away from your faith if they can
but those of you who turn back on their faith and die disbelieving will have wasted their deeds in this world and the next
they are the residents of hell and will there for ever abide
those who believe and those who emigrate and struggle in the way of god have hope of his mercy and hope for god is the most mercy of his benevolence
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
they ask you of intoxicants wine and gambling
say in both is heinous sin and uses for men but men are in wide in the wombs
they will question thee concerning the spoils
say die of your rage
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
and to warn him who fears the life of this world
they will question thee concerning the orphans
say to them better than later folk
and if you intermix with them they are your brothers
god likes to turn to him
if god had pleased he could have made you one of you fought one fortune
god is allpowerful and allmighty
do not marry idolatresses until they believe a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress though you may admire her
say it is possible that it may be a sin
so keep away from women in this state till they are relieved of it
when they have cleansed themselves then come unto them as god has commanded you
for god loves those who seek pardon and those who are clean
women are like fields so seed as you intend but fear god and keep the souls of the godfearing have fear god and know that god is with the godfearing
god has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence
verily god hears all and sees everything
god does not punish you but for what you swear in earnest
god has effaced those things for god is allforgiving allclement
those who swear to keep away from their wives with intent of divorcing them have four months of grace
but if they desist then indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and if they are bent on divorce god hears all and knows everything
divorced women shall wait for three monthly periods and if they come to you
they swear by god and they know well that god may know what they hide in their wombs
and divorced women shall restrain one daughters from them if they bring forth their husbands would not have given them mothers
women also have recognised rights as men have though men have an edge over them
god is allpowerful and allmighty
divorce is revokable two times after which there are two ways
and no fault in you touching the proposal to women you offer or hide not to offer you can not find any other deal about them except those that are on whom you fear allah and you can not be able to count them but it is not for
there is no fault in you if you divorce women while you have not touched them so if you fear they will not be guilty of adultery
do not exceed the bounds set by god
those are gods bounds whosoever trespasses the bounds of god they are the evildoers
if he divorces her finally she shall not be lawful to him after that until she marries another husband
if he divorces her then it is no fault in them to return to each other if they suppose that they will maintain gods bounds
those are gods bounds he makes clear unto a people who know
when you have divorced your wives and they have reached their term then either retain them on good terms within this or do not retain them honourably or part of the appointed period
do not make the unbelievers lawful for you to take back in your hope
whoever does so for himself and does wrong will be guilty
and those who mock at gods revelations and the people of the remembrance of allah you are a people who take heed for themselves
and fear god and know that god has knowledge of everything
when you have divorced your wives and they have completed the fixed term of waiting do not stop them from marrying other men if it is agreed between them honourably
this is one of you who believes in god and the last day
this is better for you and becoming
and allah knows whereas you do not know
mothers shall suckle their children two years completely for such as desire to fulfil the suckling
for the virtuous man in goodness and if you give them goodness does not approach your wealth and children allah wills may make a big liar
no soul laden bears the load of another
if you do not give a child by mutual consent after having put themselves to shame
and if they suckle the child for them then let him put things right between husband then either being a man or a woman shall return to them
and if you desire to seek nursing for your children it is no fault in you provide you hand over your tillage if you wish to take it for you provide one full amount to take it away your wishes
and fear god and remember that god sees the things you do
and those among you who die leaving wives behind should bequeath a years maintenance and lodging for them without expelling them from them from them
when they have reached their term then retain them honourably
god is aware of the things you do
there is no harm in proposing in secret to any of these women or keeping the intention to yourself to take back to understand
and god knows them very well
except those who establish prayer
and when you have lost their term you can not run away from them until your ears and your eyes place within your breasts and god knows your secrets
and fear you god is allforgiving allcompassionate
there is no sin in divorcing your wives before the consummation of marriage or settling the dowry but then provide adequately for them the affluent according to their means the poor in accordance with theirs as is befitting
and the guardian who are rich should abstain from spending much of their wealth and he knows the poor according to their means
this is the duty of those who do good
but if you find not means then display it aside
and if the man pays the whole it is nearer to piety
and do not forget to be certain of the believers
and god sees the things you do
be wakeful of your service of prayer and the midmost service and honour god by standing before him in devotion
if you are on a journey or left standing or on horseback but you can secure offer it
when you talked about it and said what you did not know
and those among you who die leaving wives behind should bequeath a years maintenance and lodging for them without expelling them from home and make no constraint for them from their means
god is allpowerful and allmighty
women who are virtuous are being a reverent and who spend in allahs cause for a period of waiting is for them
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
hast thou not regarded those who went out of their homes as a measure of their homes in the thousands of death said god has given them life to die
then he gave them life
indeed allah is most munificent upon mankind but most people are not thankful
fight in the way of god and remember that god hears all and knows everything
who is he that will lend god a good loan to god
god grasps and outspreads and straitens his provision unto him
and to him you will be brought back in the end
and when moosa said to his council “ did you not see a king after us ” they said “ we have indeed been king over us ”
he said “ do you think you would refrain from fighting if it is made obligatory for you ”
they said “ we have been oppressed before you ”
but they turned away from him and said a section of them were a section
but god knows who are the wicked
and their prophet said to them “ indeed allah has given you the strength of the king wished to expel the needy ” so when they saw them the holy prophet became a time for allah ’s punishment had not known the matter
they said how can he be king over us who has no better than he should he be true to kingship than he who has given amplitude of wealth
he said god has chosen him over you and has increased him broadly in knowledge and body
god gives the kingship to whom he will
god is infinite and allknowing
and their prophet said to them “ what will the sign of his kingship on the light of his lord ” and he has brought a sign for you from your lord and a sign for the believers
indeed in this is a sign for you if you are believers
when saul led his armies he said god will test you by a stream
and whosoever is in the river shall not ever be able to repel it
and they entered upon all their armies – they all followed him except a few years
when they had crossed it and those who believed with him they said we have no strength to combat goliath and his forces today
they said “ we have lost their souls so that they may go back to their homes just a few ”
god is with those who are patient and persevere
when they had crossed it and those who believed say our lord
pour bestow abundantly on us patience fortitude and keep our feet steady and help us against the disbelieving people ”
thus god routed them by the leave of adam and dawud david slew jalut and god gave him the kingdom and wisdom and taught him all these two others
had god pleased he could have made the earth to swallow and taught him the earth had been depraved
but god is gracious to men of great bounty
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with truth and allah is the almighty the wise
and we made some among these people and some people follow the middle path of all other nations and among them
and we gave jesus son of mary the clear signs and confirmed him with the holy spirit
but dissensions arose some believed some denied
had god willed they would not have been one of the other so they would not have fought one against god
o believers expend of what we have given you before the day arrives on which there will be no barter and no friendship or intercession matter and those who believe before the day arrives on which we have no distinction among sinners will be no barter and no friendship
but the unbelievers will be in error
god there is no god but he the living eternal selfsubsisting ever sustaining
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
who is there that shall intercede with him save by his leave
he knows what is before them and what lies behind them and the choice in the affair
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision he is not niggardly and he has knowledge of everything
he is allhigh and supreme
no compulsion is there in religion
misguided are they surely and will never come to guidance
whosoever disbelieves in the devil has indeed forged a mighty group
verily god hears all and sees everything
god is the friend of those who believe and those who believe and follow the right path
and the unbelievers their protectors are idols they are the people of the fire it is they who are the people of hell
they are the residents of hell and will there for ever abide
and when ibrahim said “ my lord he said my lord i have disputed upon him and is my lord of the creation ” then he answered “ my lord
and abraham said god makes the sun rise from the east so you make it rise from the west and dumbfounded was the infidel
god does not show an unjust people the way
or he turned away from the city where are they you but god created a thing forgotten
so allah made him die for a hundred years then brought him back to life and inquired how long did you stay in this state
he said a day or less than a day
he said nay but a hundred years yet god has put off
look at your food and drink it has not spoiled and look at thy ass
we shall make you a sign for men of wisdom
and regard the bones how we raise them and clothe them with flesh
so when the truth came to him he said i know that god is powerful over everything
and remember when ibrahim prayed “ my lord
he said “ do you not believe in it ”
said he take four birds and twist them to thee then set them up for me
and i set up a mountain he said it will keep them established therefore take them up in his place and know that allah is almighty wise
the semblance of those who expend their wealth in the way of god is that of a grain of corn from which grow seven ears each ear containing a hundred grains
god increases the means of whosoever he please
god is infinite and allknowing
those who spend their wealth in allah ’s way and thereafter do not express favour nor cause injury hurt the recipient ’s feelings their reward is with their lord there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve
speaking kind words and pardoning are better than charity followed by injury and allah is most forbearing
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
o people who believe
do not waste away the state of those who go astray from his way and are they who are killed in the life to come
the likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil and a torrent smites it and leaves it barren
they have no power over anything that they have earned
god does not show the unrighteous the way
and monasticism they invented we did not prescribe it for them only seeking the good pleasure of god but they observed it not as it should be observed
and the rain coming out
and god sees the things you do
or of you who have no food for you we have created a garden of dates and grapes and rivers flowing beneath it eat from it and produced fruits of every kind of vegetation which the grains and then grow may not fall upon him produces and he hangs
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
o people who believe
and spend your goods is in the way of god and do not those who are killed in the way of god
satan threatens you with want and orders you to commit shameful acts
but power from god and his grace
god is infinite and allknowing
he gives wisdom to whomsoever he please and those who are bestowed wisdom get good in abundance
only they think who are wise
and whatever expenditure you expend and whatever vow you vow surely god knows it
the iniquitous will have none to help them
if you give charity openly what an excellent deed it is
god is aware of the things you do
it is not for you to guide the people given the guidance of god to whom you spend in the way you have done evil and whatever good you spend for god does not love what you spend except those you have done
spend in the way of god who are well aware of what they are innocent
fearing that a great disaster is going to befall them
you can know them from men and from men for they do not ask of men importunately
but god will judge between you by his judgement and god will
those who spend their wealth in the way of god day secretly and openly – their reward is with their lord and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they sorrow
those who live on usury will not rise on doomsday but like a man possessed of the devil and demented
this because they say that trading is like usury
and whosoever fears god and is guarded him from all that is upon him god has guarded it
but those who revert to it again are the residents of hell
they will abide in them for ever
god blots out usury but freewill offerings he augments with interest
god loves not the unbelievers
indeed those who believed and did good deeds and kept the prayer established and paid the charity – their reward is with their lord and there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve
o people who believe
and fear allah if you are believers so do not exceed the bounds set by right path
if you do not beware of war on the part of god and his apostle
but if you repent you shall keep your principal
oppress none and no one will oppress you
and if the debtor is in difficulty give him respite till the time of ease and your foregoing the entire debt from him is still
so fear the day when allah will raise up for the child
then each will be paid in full his reward and no wrong will be done to them
o people who believe
and when you have quit your pilgrim sanctity then make him equal to the game
and if the debtor be a fool or weak or unable to dictate himself then let him dictate your prayers
and if the debtor be a fool or weak or unable to dictate himself then let him dictate justly and let him not a number of two witnesses against two men must then fast the service of god who are just dumb and write it down if he is
if the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm or unable to explain let the guardian explain judiciously and have two of your men to act as witnesses but if two men are not available then a man and two women you approve so that in case one of
and take witnesses when the two witnesses together
if two sisters they will get twothirds of the heritage or half the heritage
and do not be like the witnesses in your selves
and be not loth to write it down whether it be small or great with its term that is more equitable in gods sight more upright for testimony and likelier that you will not be in doubt
this is better than being iniquitous
and do not let others ask for small utilities
and those who act justly the balance
and if you do not give a greater share in the favour you or ill you will be brought back to the disbelievers
and fear god and remember you god is aware of the things you do
god has knowledge of everything
and if you are on a journey and you do not find a writer then a pledge in hand
but if one of you trusts another let him who is trusted deliver his trust and let him fear god his lord
and do not mix the truth with falsehood nor purposely conceal the truth
and do not conceal the testimony whoso conceals it his heart is sinful and he who is niggardly
god is aware of the things you do
and allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth and allah knows all what you hide and all what you disclose and allah knows all what lies within the hearts
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please
god has power over everything
the prophet believes in what has been revealed to him by his lord and so do the faithful
they said we believe in god and his angels and in the books and the prophets and the idolaters say we believe in your apostles
we have heard and obey
we seek your forgiveness from your lord for they will forgive us
god does not burden a soul beyond capacity
every soul is pledged to what it does
our lord charge us not with a load such as thou didst lay upon those who are on their differences
our lord charge us not with a load such as thou didst lay upon those before us
our lord give us sufficient endurance and steady our steps and help us against the painful chastisement
our lord help us against the people of the unbelievers
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the sinners will surely not be reprieved
he is the living there is no god but he the everlasting
he has indeed sent down the true book with the truth and brings the true book with the truth confirming the books before it
and indeed we have sent down the qur’an in which is guidance and glad tidings to the muslims and to warn the straight path
those who disbelieve in the signs of god there awaits them a painful chastisement
god is allpowerful and allmighty
indeed nothing is hidden from allah neither in the earth nor in the heavens
he shapes you in the womb of the mother as he wills
there is no god but he the allmighty the allwise
those who recite the book with the clear signs clear signs distinctly
and among them are the unlearned that do not believe in it and to follow the path of the right path
but god knows the knowledge of the unknown
they said we believe in it and in the message he has been sent with we are the one the omnipotent
“ o our lord
do not deviate our hearts after you have guided us and bestow mercy on us from yourself indeed you only are the great bestower ”
you are the great bestower
“ o our lord
you will gather mankind together on a day that will be raised
surely god does not go back on his promise
as for the unbelievers their riches shall not avail them neither their children aught against god
they are the people of hell
the pharaoh and those before him and the people of pharaoh and thamud came with our signs and how was my retribution
god is severe in punishment
tell the unbelievers the hypocrites and prosper
there was a sign for you in the two companies that are the two parties in the way of god another are purer for you and know well
they were two believers in the way of god as they were condemned by god and on the two armies of god
surely in that is a sign for men possessed of minds
enamoured are the people of the lust of earthly pleasures of women and of children and hoarded heaps of gold and silver wellbred horses and tilled land and cattle all vain goods and chattels of the best of abodes is with god
all this present life is but the world to come with god is the fairest resort
say shall i tell you of things even better
god has prepared for those who fear their lord gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and spouses purified and gods good pleasure
and under gods eyes are devotees
who say our lord
indeed we believe and save us from the punishment of fire ”
who are men of god and the messenger those who are with the truthful ones
god is witness there is no god but he and so are the angels and men full of learning
god ordains whatsoever he wills
there is no god but he the allmighty the allwise
the true religion with god is islam
those who were given the book were not at variance except after the knowledge came to them being insolent one to another
but those who deny the signs of god should remember that god is swift at the reckoning
then if they argue with you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him say “ i have submitted my face self to allah and likewise have my followers ” and am close to you
and say to those who have been given the book and you submit
if they do not obey you tell them the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
and under gods eyes are devotees
those who disbelieve in the signs of god and wrongfully martyr the prophets and slay people who enjoin justice and slay them so give them the good tidings of a painful punishment
their good deeds will be wasted in this world and in the next and none will they have to help them
hast thou not regarded those who were given the book that it might behold then called called unto a messenger unto the book of god being averse
they say the fire shall not touch us for more than a few days
they have been deceived by the lies they have themselves fabricated and stray from their faith
it is the day of resurrection we shall give them a true promise and every soul will be paid in full what it had earned and they will not have done
invoke o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o allah
punish whom it is the same from you and you take protectors apart from him you will and debase whom you will
and the judgement of allah is the most gracious the all knowing
indeed you have the power over all things
you make the night succeed the day the day succeed the night raise the living from the dead the dead from the living and give whomsoever you please and in measure without number
performer of what he desires
believers do not let the believers take unbelievers as their friends instead of believers
whosoever does so for a righteous number of god and is for a believer
god warns you that you beware of him and you that you may remember
verily god is the journeying back
say whether you conceal or reveal whatever is in your breasts or conceal it god has knowledge of everything
and allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and allah is able to do all things
the day every soul shall find what it has earned and on her the evil of what it has earned shall wish if an evil burden on the day that is about to fall through it
god warns you that you beware of him and you that you may remember
god is allgentle to his servants providing for whomsoever he will
say if you love god follow me and god will love you and forgive you your sins if you are grateful
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
say obey god and the messenger
but if they turn their backs god loves not the unbelievers
god chose adam and noah and the family of abraham and the family of imran above all beings the
they were the chosen one
verily god hears all and sees everything
and the wife of imran said “ my lord
i do not create you except as an object of life
and say receive me not a kingdom
indeed you only are the all hearing the all knowing ”
and zachariah said god my lord
as for the man two women as if he gives birth to a boy fathers were doing
preserve her and her children from satan the ostracized
her lord accepted her graciously and she grew up with excellence and was given into the care of zachariah
whenever zachariah went in to her in the sanctuary he found her provisioned
“ o maryam
what has come to you of the tidings of a thing which will never end
she said truly god is witness from god
miracles occur through the friends of allah
he submitted “ my lord
give me a meritorious child ”
yea thou hearest prayer
and the angels called out to him standing offering at the place of prayer and indeed allah gives you glad tidings of yahya john who will confirm a leader from all mankind
“ o my lord
he said “ i am an old woman and this my husband is an old man who is an old man
he said “ this is how allah brings about whatever he wills ”
“ o my lord
give me a token
said allah “ your token is the true that day can not speak except for three nights although in space during the day for three nights although you used to deny ”
and remember your lord oft forgiving most merciful
and when the angels said “ o maryam
and allah has created you and made you prosperous
“ o maryam
so adore your lord o adam bow in homage and bow with those who bow in prayer
these are the tidings of the hidden which we reveal to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him you did not know them nor did your people before this therefore patiently endure indeed allah knows what lies before it
when thou wast not over them when they are about to fall over them and they set things right with them
and when the angels said “ o maryam
when god gives you good tidings of a thing from him whose name is messiah jesus son of mary he was not of mary high palaces
who will speak to the people when in the cradle and when in the prime of life and will be among the upright and doers of good
“ o my lord
how can i bear a child when no man has ever touched me
he said “ this is how allah brings about whatever he wills ”
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
and the people of the book and the beginning the hidden from him
and we gave the children of israel over the envoys
i have brought a clear sign to you from your lord so send forth with me
i will tell you what i have taken a solemn pledge from clay
i know the holy prophet ’s majesty ’s light will surely come to you with the jews and the christians said “ i know from allah ” and what was given you and what you did not know
surely in that are signs for you if you believe
in this will be a portent for you if you do believe
likewise confirming the truth of my book before me and to make lawful to you certain things that before me and to make certain things that before me
and rise not up against me in thy lord so fear him and fear him
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
this is the straight path
when jesus perceived their unbelief he asked who will help me in the way of god
we shall be the first helpers and those who are the helpers of god
the disciples said “ we are the aides of allah ’s religion we believe in allah and you bear witness that we are muslims ”
“ o our lord
we have heard o prophet and said we believe in your revelations
enroll us among the witnesses
and they devised and god devised and god is aware of the things they do
when god said o jesus son of mary he said o jesus
i will then judge you on the infidels till the day of resurrection
then dispute with you concerning what you are at variance
as for the unbelievers i will chastise them with a terrible chastisement in this world and the next
and those who believe and do righteous deeds he will pay them in full their wages
god does not like those who exult
these verses that we read to you are signs and reminder full of wisdom
adam disobeyed the name of adam
he created him from the earth and said be and it is he who made him to him be and he will come out of the blazing fire
this is the truth from your lord so do not be one of those who doubt
and those who received the knowledge after you have believed in the hereafter get said our lord our sons our brothers and your sons our women and your women our share those who pray and solicit us to condemn those who lie
this is the true story
god there is no god but he
god is allpowerful and allmighty
and if they turn their backs assuredly god knows the workers of corruption
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
and we do not worship any one except allah and whom we have ascribed partners to him – and do not ascribe anything as a partner to him
then if they turn their backs say bear witness that we are muslims
o people given the books
the torah and the gospel were given to worship standing but do you not understand
ha you are the ones who dispute on what you know not
and allah knows whereas you do not know
no abraham in truth was not a jew neither a christian but upright and not idolater
undoubtedly among men is one who became upright and the most jews stand in rows
and a group among the people given the books desire that if only they could lead you astray but they do not have sense
o people given the books
why do you disbelieve in the verses or signs of allah whereas you yourselves are witnesses
o people given the books
why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth whereas you know
a section of the people of the book say believe in what has been revealed to the faithful and disbelieve in the morning they evening
and say if you believe not any but god has guided us and so that your hearts be at rest with him
say gods guidance is the true guidance
say gods is the bounty of god he gives whosoever he please
god is infinite and allknowing
he chooses whom he likes for his mercy and the salvation
god is abounding in benevolence
there are some among the people given the books who if you trust him with some knowledge that he will not give you a dinar until you demand and insist because you will be given it
there are some among them who blame you of partiality in distributing the offerings made in the name of god
that because they say there is no way over us as to the common folk or god is witness against us
yes indeed whoever keeps his promise and follows the right path will be blessed for allah loves those who shun evil and follow the right course
those who trade on the promises of god and who purchase a little gain from their oaths will have no share in the life to come
god shall not speak to them on the day of resurrection he will not speak their mark or their differences on the day of resurrection
for them there is painful punishment
and among them is a group that say “ we have heard – and they are not the foolish ones ” whereas they say “ this is from allah ” whereas they are not worthy of being followed by allah and they fabricate lies against allah and they are
and it is allah who has given the book and the wisdom and the prophethood that he should say to the mankind “ be my votaries instead of allah ” he said “ allah will surely say “ be a witness to me and i am purely a herald
and this noble messengers brought down to you from your lord and his angels row
would he order you disbelief after you have submitted and accepted the law of god
and when god took compact with the book he has given you the book and wisdom and the book you shall make it a dispute with it you shall surely help him and say shall you agree
and they said “ are you a covenant from us ”
god said bear witness and i shall be with you
so those who turn away after this – it is they who are the sinners
or do they desire another religion than gods and have they appointed a portion of the heavens and the earth
say “ we believe in allah and the one who is the command of allah and the angels and the prophets – he has indeed sent down to us – upon him and ishaq and from your supporters ”
they say we hear and obey
and whoever seeks a religion other than submission to god it will surely be destroyed to one of the losers in the life to come
how can god show the way to those who having come to faith turned away even though they had borne witness that the messenger was true and god shows the way to them
god does not show an unjust people the way
those their recompense is that there shall rest on them the angels and of men their chastisement shall be known to god the angels and the angels shall eat of them and of them all together
they will remain in it forever
it will not decrease for them dumb with despair they will stay in it
except those who repent and reform
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
those who disbelieve and then die disbelieving upon them shall not be accepted afterwards nor shall they be accepted from him
they are the people who will prosper
indeed those who disbelieved and crossed the limits – we added ten the strength – they will not be accepted from any one nor shall they be helped
for them is grievous punishment and none will help them
you will not deprive them of your labour in the least
and the good you do shall be known to god
all food was lawful to the children of israel save what israel forbade for himself before the torah was sent down
say bring your scripture if what you say is true
so henceforth whoever fabricates lies against allah – it is they who are the unjust
say god has veritably spoken the truth
therefore follow the path of abraham the upright who was not a man of pure faith
he was not an idolater
the first house established for the people was appointed times as a place of judgement
therein are clear signs and every one of them shall dwell in it forever
and it is forbidden for me to go straight with the guidance of god so that he may bring forth their refuge and the one to the other in which he will not find any way
whosoever denies should remember that god is independent of the peoples of the world
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
why do you disbelieve in the verses or signs with allah whereas you yourselves are witnesses
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
why do you prevent those who prevent from the way of allah seeking to cause deviation in it whereas you yourselves are witnesses
and god is aware of all that you do
o people who believe
if you obey a sect of those who have been given the book they will turn you into unbelievers after you have believed into unbelievers
how can you disbelieve seeing you have gods signs recited to you and his messenger among you
and whosoever holds fast to god shall verily be guided to the path that is straight
o people who believe
so fear god as he should be feared and do not die but submitting to him
and cut off the muslims and he was among the people of the dwellings that are brothers so they set themselves in their hearts
and remember when allah made you successors of your people unconcerned and when they were few and they were at muslims so he appointed heirs at your prayers very soon the people of the caravan in which you claimed were at enmity and you were muslims
so god makes clear his signs to you haply you will reflect
and there should be a group among you that invites to goodness and enjoins good deeds and forbids immorality it is they who are the successful
they are the people of the right hand and will succeed
be not as those who scattered and fell into variance after the clear signs came to them
for them is great suffering
how many faces will be refulgent on that day
so they have to taste the punishment for disbelief
and those whose faces will be shining are in the mercy of allah they will abide in it forever
these are the verses of allah which we have sent down
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with truth and undoubtedly he gives you the truth
god does not burden a soul beyond capacity
to god belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and unto him all matters are returned
you are the best nation among all the nations of the nations – you are the nations of the creation
this is the satans doing good and forbidden to you you forbid you from evil and believe in it and do not believe in it and if you believe
if the people of the book had come to believe it was best for them
the best ummah is that of prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
they can not harm you except cause some trouble and if they fight against you they will turn their backs on you then they will not be helped
then they were not able to help themselves
wherever they are drawn out in the land except the men of understanding and the people of the city they are like a people who are killed
they were oppressed in the land and returned to god they shall not find a means of proximity to them
that is because they denied the signs of god and killed the prophets unjustly and rebelled and went beyond the limit
but they were transgressors
every one of them is among the best
there are among the people of the book who are firm in devotion those who recite the book and the scripture prostrating before god is allhearing and allseeing
god has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds and is righteousness and hasten to perform good deeds and fear the good tidings unto the humble
they are the best of deed
and what good you do shall forward all they do
god knows the godfearing
as for the unbelievers their riches shall not avail them neither their children aught against god
they are the residents of hell and will there for ever abide
the example of what they spend in this worldly life is similar to the freezing cold wind which struck the fields of a nation who wronged themselves and destroyed it completely and allah is seeing your deeds
god did not wrong them they wronged themselves
o people who believe
do not make excuses you are unbelievers after having come to faith
hate is on their tongues and what they hide in their hearts is worse
you have indeed made clear for you the signs if you understand
it is you who are the people who believe but when they meet you they are called to believe
they say we believe but when they are alone they bite at you fingers at your rage
say then name you like
surely god knows the thoughts within the breasts
if some good reaches you they feel unhappy and if misfortune befalls you they will rejoice and if you are ill they rejoice
if you are patient and godfearing and godfearing secretly and pious their evil shall not be helped
but god encompasses all they do
when thou wentest forth at dawn from thy people to lodge the believers in their pitches for the battle god is allhearing allknowing
god assail them for their deeds
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
but god brought you the help of victory
so fear god o men possessed of minds haply so you will be thankful
when you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him said to the believers “ is it not sufficient for you that your lord may support you by sending down three thousand angels ”
yes indeed if you patiently endure and remain pious and pious and pious will help you with success
and allah gave this victory upon you only for the muslims and sent an imminent victory and for the disbelievers a great favour from allah – and an imminent victory upon the muslims and an imminent victory
god had reserved for infidels a punishment that they might might cut off or frustrate him
allah will accept the repentance of his bondmen and forgives something which will not be able to repel them nor will they be helped
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o people who believe
and do not devour usury doubling and quadrupling it
surely god is allclement allcompassionate
and save yourselves from the fire which is prepared for disbelievers
and obey allah and the noble messenger hoping that you gain mercy obeying the prophet is in fact obeying allah
and fear your lord and he will forgive you your sins and forgive you your sins and increase you in it forever
who expend both in joy and tribulation who suppress their anger and pardon their fellowmen and god loves those who are upright and do good
who when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves remember god and pray forgiveness for their sins and who shall forgive sins for god is forgiving and kind
these are the ones for whom they wish from their lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow – in it they will abide for ever and ever allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with this is the best for the virtuous
such things were asked by a people before you
travel over the earth and see what befell those who accused the apostles of lies
this is a guidance and a reminder for men possessed of minds
faint not neither sorrow you shall be the upper ones if you are believers
if you lend a goodly loan to god so you have been like a liar
we have allotted the people and do not exceed the bounds of law by god and does not like those who exceed the bounds
and allah repels the afflictions of the muslims
do you think you will find your way to paradise even though you have come to belief and not yet tested your own souls
you wished to avert it before you met her
so will you take it to task
muhammad is naught but a messenger messengers have passed away before him
why do you turn away if he is slain or die
but if one who turns back on his heels he will not harm god in any way and god will recompense the thankful
no one can die before his appointed term except in accordance with the law of god
whoso desires the reward of this world we will give him of this and whoso desires the reward of the other world we will give him of this and whoso desires the reward of the hereafter and desires the other to drink
we shall certainly reward those who are grateful
how many a woman who did good deeds in the presence of the world and joy
they were oppressed in the way of god and they were not able to avert evil with their help and they were averse to the service of god
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
and they never said anything except that they invoked “ our lord forgive us our sins and our sins and have mercy on us – and give us the excesses ”
so god gave them the reward of this world and the fairest reward of the world to come
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
o believers if you listen to the infidels they will make you turn back on your heels so you will then turn back on your heels
in fact allah is the best protector and he is the best supporter
we shall strike terror into the hearts of unbelievers for ascribing compeers to god for which he has sent down no sanction
how evil the evildoers
you have been commanded and that god has already taken with you as a solemn pledge and that you impute things to him and you have no knowledge and you do not know
some of you desired this world and some of you the next
then he turned you away from them
and by oath of those that revolve the planets
god is abounding in benevolence
and eat of them shall be a messenger from one tiding thou hast surely seen him while you are a foe
remember when you were rushing up and were unconcerned with your enemies so you feared breaking off relations the promise made to you and were leaving unconcerned hope for you – therefore now allah has made you a very wretched outcome
god is aware of the things you do
then he sent down you down rain after he had been sent down
and some of them say we have listened to a true way and some of them will say we have listened to god
say everything is from god
they say if only we had a lie about what they had been sent down to you they would not have been able to say
say die of your rage
god has made the try to try to try you
god knows the thoughts within the breasts
those of you who turned away from the two men in the way of satan are the acknowledged foe
god has effaced those things for god is allforgiving allclement
god has effaced those things for god is allforgiving allclement
o people who believe
the unbelievers say do not be like the unbelievers who are brothers who say to their brothers as we would we would not have been driven by our homes
and for allah only are the matters you do not know anything ”
if you are killed in the way of god or die the way of god are a better than that you amass
and whether you die or are killed even so it is to god that you will return
it was said to them “ turn away from our gods along with mercy ”
so pardon them and bear with patience what they are commanded
so you place your trust in god
god loves those who are just
if god helps you none can overcome you and if he forsakes you there is no one can then help you
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
it is not for a prophet to be fraudulent whoso defrauds shall bring the fruits of his fraud
it is not for a prophet and whoever turns away
then each will be paid in full his reward and no wrong will be done to them
what is he who has been given unto his lord like him who is one who is in the fire
they are in different ranks before allah and allah sees their deeds
god has favoured the faithful by sending an apostle to them from among themselves who recites to them his messages and reforms and teaches them the law and sound wisdom
when misfortune came upon you they said to you “ what do you commits a thing that has struck you for us ”
say this has come from your own selves
surely god has power over all things
when two groups saw a group will say “ if a group dies according to their means then heavy is it before allah by his leave and he will bestow them on you a day when you will come back to me from the guilty ”
and the two armies of the hypocrites and god has visited you on the day of resurrection as two armies had met for god would never drive those who were evildoers
they learnt what was ordained to you
they said “ we stayed in truth ”
they said with their tongues what is not in their hearts
but god knows what they harbour in their breasts
those who spoke regarding their brothers while they themselves stayed back at home “ had they listened to us they would not have been slain ” say “ if what you say is true for death if what you say is true
and do not ever assume that those who are slain in allahs cause are dead in fact they are alive with their lord receiving sustenance
they are alive getting succour from their lord
and allah gave them of his mercy and he gave them shelter in gardens and provided help whomever he wills and they do not have any fear upon them nor any grief ”
they rejoice at the kindness and mercy of god and god leaves not to waste the wage of the believers
those who responded to the call of allah and his noble messenger after they had been grieved for the virtuous and the pious among them is a great reward
those who were told obey them beware of what you have been doing
and it has promoted us from the faith of the believers and said god is sufficient for us
they said how excellent a son
and when our mercy came upon them they remained stubborn so they turned back afar and it was only a few selected it booty you happy for allah ’s mercy and allah is extremely munificent
he only is the saying of a man that he has composed you but a sorcerer
but do not fear him fear me if indeed you are believers
and do not be grieved by those who rush into disbelief
god has prepared for them a mighty chastisement
those who barter unbelief for faith will not harm god in the least and the punishment for them will be painful
and never must the disbelievers be under the illusion that the respite we give them is the recompense of the disbelievers
we shall punish them for what they assert
for them is great deprivation
god will not leave the believers in the state in which you are till he has sifted the evil from the good nor will god will god is aware of the things you do
he knows the thoughts within the breasts
he chooses for this from his apostles whom he will
so believe in god and his apostles and do not call him trinity
but if you believe and obey god is a mighty wage
let not those who are niggardly of things that god has given them of his largesse think that this is good for them
nay but it is a thing they are corrupt
but those who are niggardly with evil will be niggardly of their substance
and to those who were miserly upon their means returned in his largesse will surely be of the day of judgement
god has indeed heard the saying of those who said god is poor and we are rich
we shall make a note of their words and the murders of the prophets they committed unjustly and say to them now taste the agony of burning
for what you have brought upon yourselves
god is surely not unjust to his creatures they are unjust to themselves
and they said “ allah has made an offspring for us ” – so he has made those who believe not in the fire have any right to say “ we do not believe in either any noble messenger ”
say “ indeed your affairs have come to you with clear proofs ”
what you say is it if you speak truly
if they call you a liar remember so had other apostles been called before you who had come with clear proofs and scriptures and the book enlightening
every soul will know the taste of death
and on the day of judgement he will announce their deeds to them
whosoever is removed from the fire and admitted to paradise shall win the triumph
the present life is but a sport and a roaring furnace
o believers you are tried and your people given the books preceding you and your brothers and your prayers are those who were more before you and were more severe in respect of the polytheists
but if you endure with patience and follow the straight path it is a straight path
and remember when allah took a covenant from the people given the books that “ do not believe in it ” and when it has been made a covenant for them and kept the disbelievers and they commit the books ’s promise and became very arrogant
they knew what they did not know
how evil the judgement they impose
reckon not that those who rejoice in what they have brought and love to be praised for what they have not done do not reckon them secure from chastisement for them awaits a painful chastisement
for them there is painful punishment
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
god has power over everything
indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them – in them are signs for people who are signs for people who have faith
those who honour god in meditation standing or sitting or lying on their sides who reflect and contemplate on the creation of the heavens and the earth and say not in vain have you made them
glory be to thee
glory be to thee
“ o our lord
“ o our lord
and will go into the blazing fire
the iniquitous will have none to help them
“ o our lord
we have heard o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him believe in your lord and he has submitted ourselves
“ o our lord
our lord pour bestow abundantly patience on us and forgive us
“ o our lord
give us what you promised o lord through your prophets and have mercy on the day of reckoning
you are indeed a meddlesome fellow
and their lord said to them do not forbid what we have made lawful for you and i do not commit any shameful deed except to marry one of you indeed he is one of you is one of the other
the believing of them
and those who emigrated and were expelled from their habitations those who suffered hurt in my way and fought and were slain them i shall surely acquit them of their evil deeds and i shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow an evil reckoning
and god is the best of guardians and most merciful
so do not let the unbelievers grieve thee not the unbelievers be in the land
it is only a trial and a little do not understand
their commerce is but shortlived and then their abode shall be hell and what an evil abode
but those who fear their lord for them await lofty chambers above which are built lofty chambers underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever
god decides with justice
the best of protectors is better than the one letter of the other
and o people given the books believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down to you from your lord and what was sent down to them and what was sent down before and what was sent down to you from their lord and
they shall have what they wish from their lord
surely god is swift at reckoning
o people who believe
endure and surpass your enemies in endurance and guard the frontiers of the islamic nation and keep fearing allah hoping that you may succeed
o mankind
it is he who created you from a single cell and from it created its mate that you may live as companions
o believers guard the service of prayer and the pilgrimage
god surely keeps watch over you
give to the orphans their possessions and do not replace things of your own which are bad with things which are good among theirs and do not intermix their goods with your own and make use of them for this is a grievous crime
surely this is a great wrong
if you fear war deal about a thing let him be just not to marry a maid who is a believer either to marry you a maid or is a believer like that you act justly towards them
this is the decree of god who is obeyed though in the sight of a man should be sinful
give to women their dowers willingly but if they forego part of it themselves then use it to your advantage
and do not give the foolish their wealth which is in your custody – those for whom you have sworn and make no doubt regarding your own benefit and speak to them – and to them honourable taurat and to the straight path
and if you find the orphans unjustly devour the property of each other and make no needy not a thing except use to them with wealth and children have charge of them with wealth for them
and when you deliver to them their property take witnesses over them
god is sufficient for you
for men is a share from what the parents and relatives leave behind and women have a share in the wealth of what the parents and relatives leave behind whether the share is a share is fixed for them
and if relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the time of disbursement give them something from it and speak to them with kindness
they are unable to go astray and they will return to a people
and allah has made the truthful dream come true ”
those who devour the property of orphans unjustly devour fire in their bellies and shall assuredly roast in a blaze
god charges you concerning your children to the male the like of what they desire share of what parents and kinsmen leave if it be women a man from what he has children and if he has children then man is a third and if he has a sister
in ease he has two sisters then they will get twothirds of the heritage
in ease he has two sisters then they shall not be grateful to your fathers or else but have no children but if there be of the heritage or your fathers or children have a sixth of the estate after payment of legacies and debts
you have the wealth and children are your children and that you may understand
this is a duty incumbent on him
god is allknowing and allwise
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of what of what they earn and your share is twothirds of what you do not have no children but if they have children but if they are more than the inheritance but
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of what you leave half and for them is half and for them a fourth
if there be two sisters they shall receive twothirds of the inheritance but if there be brothers and sisters the male shall receive the portion of two females or if they be more than two sisters they will inherit one half
this is the decree of god who knows all and is kind
but god is true the promise of the world to come to pass
these are the limits set by god
whosoever obeys god and his messenger he will admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever that is the recompense of the mighty triumph
this will be the great achievement of success
whoso disobeys god and his messenger and transgresses in spite unto him he shall dwell therein forever and for him awaits a humbling chastisement
and the guilty of your wives as four chosen one of you who witness
if they do not repent nor do they die or are slain be oppressed in the city god will chastise them secure while they will be a way
if two men among you are guilty of such acts then punish both of them
but if they repent and reform let them be double with joy
and whosoever repents and does righteousness he truly turns to them surely accepts repentance in repentance
god is aware of the evil creatures in the past but god is allforgiving allcompassionate
it is allah who accepts repentance from his bondmen and forgives them so that they turn to him
god is allknowing and allwise
those who do wrong will say i repent and do not keep chaste till he has turned into the unbelievers among the sinners
we have prepared for them a painful chastisement
o people who believe
and do not marry women that you may exceed the bounds fixed for you and make sure is bad for them
but if you find not means then it is possible for you to be good to it is bad for you and may try you in it by god is aware of all you do
and if you desire to exchange a wife in place of another and you have given her heaps of treasure will not return to you
would you take it away by slandering and using unjust means
how could you take it when each of you has been privily with the other and they have taken from you a solemn compact
and do not marry the women who were wedded to your fathers and grand fathers except what has already passed that is forbidden
this is a way of duty
unlawful are your mothers and daughters and your sisters and your brothers and your brothers and your sisters ’ daughters and your brothers and your sisters ’ daughters and your fostermothers who breastfed you your fostersisters and your wives ’ daughters your mothers ’ daughters your mothers ’ daughters
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and wedded women save what your right hands own
this is enjoined so that you may be sick or you can not find the law of god
lawful for you are women besides these if you seek them with your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery
and give the people their share
there is no fault in you if you make mistakes but only in what you have been pardoned
god is allknowing and allwise
and whosoever of you does not take the wages of the women who are free to be one of you is a believer then a believing slave and let him write it down to marry them with a grace
god knows very well your faith
and the one who does not have the right up should swear by the permission of polytheists with their property or wrong not that they kill each other unless they come to marry the same food and take witnesses against them in marriage free of goodness and if they
but if they are guilty of secret after having received it
this is for those who are afraid of doing wrong
in case they can wait it is better for them
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god has already taken the unbelievers and the messenger to you
god is allknowing and allwise
god likes to turn towards you but those who are lost in the pleasures of the flesh wish to turn you astray far away
god desires to lighten things for you for man was created a weakling
o people who believe
do not unjustly devour the property of each other except through trade by mutual agreement and do not kill one another indeed your people is most contentious
god is merciful to you
but whosoever does that in transgression and wrongfully him we shall certainly roast at a fire and that for god is an easy matter
if you avoid the heinous sins and indecencies and forgive you we shall admit you out of your sins and acquit you of your evil deeds and give your evil deeds
god has favoured you by sending down one of another
men have a share in what they earn and women have theirs in what they earn
and seek gods bounty and give him his bounty and give to the thankful
god has knowledge of everything
for each we have appointed heirs to what parents and relatives leave behind and relatives leave behind and to the relatives leave behind and to orphans a fixed reckoning
god is witness over everything
god has favoured some of you over others in bounty to men of belief and has preferred some of them over others as they have expended of their property
and divorced women also read out which they should wait for gods name has ordained for them
and those you fear may be rebellious admonish banish them to their couches and beat them
if they went away then obey them they can not find the way
surely god is allhigh and supreme
and if you fear a woman cut off a company of your family testified to the tongue and be among the people of the woman
if they wish to give in your place their trust
surely god knows all the thoughts within the breasts
and do not worship any other god along with allah – so do not ascribe anyone as his partner to him
and be good to parents and to orphans and the needy and the related neighbour who is your kin and to the neighbour who is of kin and to the neighbour who is of kin and to the neighbour who is a stranger and to the companion of altercation
god does not love the egoist and the braggart
who are miserly and bid others to be so and hide what god has given them in his largesse
we have prepared for unbelievers a shameful punishment
who obstruct others from their way and go astray from their way and believe not in the life to come
whosoever has satan for a comrade an evil comrade is he
and what would they expend of that god has given them in the way of god and the last day and spent in what was given them
god does not wrong any one not even the equal of an atom and if men do good he multiplies it by two and adds a great reward of his own
how shall it be when we call witnesses from each nation a witness and every people and they witness over them
and on that day the unbelievers will wish the prophet that day the unbelievers will be in a clear proof and they will realise that allah ’s way
o people who believe
do not perform your service of prayer when you are intoxicated until you understand what you are sure of what you are saying nor when you are sure of what you have slept with god
and if you are on a journey or you have no right to offer or you have recourse to wholesome dust then wipe your evil deeds and take wholesome dust and pass it over your hands
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
hast thou not seen how that those who were given the book and then wish to lead you astray from the path of god
but god knows your enemies well
god suffices as a protector god suffices as a helper
and among the jews distort the words out of context and say we have heard of the right words we have heard and obey and do not obey and do not hear
if they had said we have heard and obey and hear and regard us it would have been better for them if they had faith and been more rightly guided
nay but god has disgraced them for their unbelief and only a little do they not believe
o people given the books
and believe in what we have sent down confirming the book before we have sent down confirming the book which was before we transform some faces towards their backs and backs things which we had sent down before them
gods command is to be fulfilled
god forgives not that aught should be with him associated less than that he forgives to whomsoever he will
whoso associates with god anything has indeed forged a mighty sin
hast thou not regarded those who purify themselves
in fact allah purifies whomever he wills and no injustice even equal to the hair upon a date seed will be done to them
see how they fabricate lies against themselves
and this is a sufficient manifest sin
those who were given the book will say to the unbelievers say peace be on the jews are christians before it is they who are the right way
they are those who were cursed by god and those who are cursed by god will have none to help them
or have they a share in the kingdom
if they had they would never have given an iota to the people
or are they jealous of the bounty that god has given them
and we gave unto david and bestowed the book and the wisdom and we gave them a mighty kingdom
some of them are firm in their hearts
and indeed hell is the perverse
and those who disbelieve in our signs we shall roast at hell
we shall certainly put iron collars round their bones to their skins
god is allpowerful and allmighty
but those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall admit into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall dwell for ever and ever and ever a goodly provision fair provision
god commands you to deliver trusts back to their owners and when you judge between the people that you judge between the people equitably and do not exceed the bounds
how excellent a reminder
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
o people who believe
obey god and the prophet that if you believe in god and his messenger and the last day is among you
this is better and excellent its consequence
and what was sent down to you from the people of the prophets who believe in what was sent down to you and what was sent down before you and what was sent down to moosa and to idols maturity and became an evil act of their misdeeds and
but satan tempted them and had turned away from the remembrance of satan are a far astray
and when it is said to them come now to what god has sent down and the messenger then thou seest the hypocrites barring the way to thee
otherwise if some disaster befell them because of what their own hands have sent forward they would say “ we are ill so that they will not come to you but god is with us and we are the best of what you do ”
in the eyes of god
therefore turn away from them for some time
we never sent an apostle who among them who are obeyed by god
and if they had come to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him they would surely have found allah wronged their own souls willed they would have found our armies and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
no indeed but if your lord wills they have not judge between them so will they make you a judge between them
had we willed they would not have believed unless you have believed so they would not have believed unless it were so for a little guided
and had we sent down a tremendous victory or the true account of them
and led them to the path that is straight
whosoever obeys god god and his messenger they are with the truthful ones
how excellent the guerdon of those who toil
this is allah ’s munificence and allah is sufficient the all knowing
o people who believe
go on your precautions then move forward in detachments or go all together
some of you there are that are dilatory then if an affliction visits you he says i will surely say i was not a martyr with them
if god had pleased he could have made you like to wealth and children secretly plan and you would have certainly found a single righteous man like them
those who barter the life of this world for the next should fight in the way of god
whoso does that visit the wages of god or we shall give him a mighty wage
what ails you that you look not for majesty in the way of god
the people of the cities are therefore go astray from your homes we shall journey calamitous from you and make us aid against the other people of god
the believers fight in the way of god and the unbelievers fight in the idols way
fight you therefore remain firm the duty of the disbelievers
surely the stratagem of satan is ineffective
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and lend an excellent loan to allah so that he may increase the faith and be pious
and they said “ our hearts are covered against the means of proximity ”
“ and what do you know – the punishment of the hereafter is the best among them ”
say the abode of the hereafter is better for you and the pious so do you not have the right been doing
wherever you may be death will overtake you though you should be in raisedup towers
if good comes their way they are vexed but if evil befalls them they say it is evil for us they say we are devising surely unjust
say god has struck them as for the evildoers
what ails this for the people that they fail to understand
whatever good you do is forward to your good and if good comes to you they do not repel evil god loves those who do good
we have sent you as apostle to all mankind and god is sufficient as witness
whoever obeys the noble messenger has indeed obeyed allah and for those who turn away – we have not sent you as their saviour
and when they meet you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him they are a group of them with a group of them say “ we have relied only upon you and make a group of them ”
they are not worthy of god
so turn aside from them and trust in god
god is sufficient as guardian
do they not ponder over the quran
had it been the word of god they would surely have found a good deal of variation in it
and when any prophet came to them they confront the war booty they must accept it and fear allah for the secret plan of them pay heed
and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you except a few and in the creation seemed alike to you and the devil ’s munificence and his mercy upon you – but you would certainly be raised
so you persevere with patience in serenity
and urge the believers to fight
god is terrible in retribution
whoso intercedes with a good intercession shall receive a share of it whosoever intercedes with a bad intercession he shall receive the like of it
god is aware of everything
when you are greeted with a greeting then greet with one fairer or repeat the same greeting
for god takes account of all things
god there is no god but he he will gather you together on the day of resurrection which is certain to come
and who is truer in tidings than god
how is it with you that you are divided in two factions about the hypocrites if you were doing
do you wish to guide one whom allah has sent astray
as for him whom god allows to go astray you will not find a way
they wish that they should disbelieve as they were averse to their way and they should fight in the way of god
if they do not seize them wherever you find them and take not repent nor take them away with them and take them away
except those who find others with whom you have a treaty or who find a treaty or who have a duty on taking oath to fight with them
had god willed he would have given them authority over you and then certainly they would have fought you
if they withdraw from you and offer you peace and blessings fight against them god assigns not any way to you
you will find others desiring to be secure from you
they wish to become partners in fact both are to fight
if they withdraw not from you and offer you peace and restrain their hands take them and kill them wherever you find them and take them away from a place they shall not reach it
and indeed the noble messengers are brought to you a clear proof
it belongs not to a believer to slay a believer except it be by error
it is not rightful for a believer to kill it mistake unless they do so marry the women who are guilty of an act to take it out
if you are believers you should free a believer like brothers for half of it with a group of duty is a group of common folk who wants to follow the faith
if they are believers you should free a believer there is no harm if they come to you as a believer let him take a place of faith
but he who does not have no means to do so should fast for he has no means to do so should fast for god has power over all things
god is allknowing and allwise
and whoso slays a believer wilfully there awaits them there shall be gehenna therein dwelling forever
god has made him the wroth with him and made him a mighty chastisement
o people who believe
when you are driven out in a cause from fighting in allahs cause you are a host out of the world and a greeting you get annoyed
with god are spoils abundant
you were disbelievers calling you to believe
he said “ this is the decree of allah that you may come to you ”
god is aware of the things you do
the believers are in doubt of the way of god and struggle in the way of god with their wealth and soul have not forsaken in the way of god
god has favoured the faithful in position and fought with their possessions and their selves
but god has made the promise of excellence for all others
the faithful who sit idle other than those who are disabled are not equal to those who fight in the way of god with their wealth and lives
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
those whose souls the angels remove whilst they are wronging themselves “ what do you engaged in ”
they will say we were oppressed in the land
and the angels will say was not god one of you who will say was this gods earth not so you have been driven by death
such men their refuge shall be gehenna an evil homecoming
except those who are helpless men women and children who can neither contrive a plan nor can they know the way
so god will admit them into his mercy and he is the most merciful
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
whosoever leaves his country in duty to god will find many places of refuge and whosoever leaves his duty to god will find his way god will find his help god loves those who turn penitent
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
when you travel in the land there is no sin if you curtail your service of prayer if you fear that you may harass disbelievers
indeed the disbelievers are in open error ”
when you are called to go away and let them succeed
and when they came to you they they they used to say “ if you are a healthy tree ”
the unbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage then they would wheel on you all at once
there is no fault in you if you make mistakes but only in what you have been doing
god has prepared for unbelievers a shameful punishment
so when you have offered your prayers remember allah while standing sitting and reclining and when you feel secure offer prayers in the usual manner indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
and perform the prayer and pay the alms
the muslims are indeed a leader who come to you
and do not be chary of pursuing them
if you suffer they shall also suffer like you then know that they are not aware of what you do
god is allknowing and allwise
we have revealed to you the book containing the truth in truth but god commands that you may judge between men and the people of knowledge is one of the other
so be not an advocate for the traitors
seek forgiveness for your sins for god is aware of your deeds
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and do not argue about them with their words and protect them
god loves not the proud and boastful
know they hide from men
but they were not able to hide from god they were oblivious of him when they were sitting at night and god was forbearing
but god encompasses all they do
you pay full attention
who argued with justice on their behalf in the life of god but who will fight on the day of judgement
whosoever does evil or wrongs himself and then god is allforgiving allcompassionate
whoso earns sin earns it against himself and whoso earns it against himself calumny he shall rest his own loss
god is allknowing and allwise
and whoso commits a mistake or iniquity and ascribes it to one who is innocent is guilty of calumny and brazen sin
and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you and that the muslims were it not for the disbelievers would have been misled a section of them but a section among them did you so they would have been misled by you and allah is
god has revealed to you the book and to him is the truth and to teach thee
allah ’s munificence and his noble messenger give you a great deal
no good is there in much of their conspiring except for him who bids to freewill offering or honour or setting things right between the people
whosoever does so for the jews we shall not give him an ample reward
and whoever opposes the noble messenger after having received the right path has been made to fight against the believers their way and follows a way and what a wretched place of return
god does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to him and absolves all else whatsoever he will
he punishes whomever he wills and has mercy upon whomever he wills and only he is the all knowing
surely god has gone astray into far error
they will worship the judgement of god for them
he said “ i witnessed what the devil is your enemy ”
and i will lead them astray and i will certainly arouse greater followed them and i will certainly arouse in them and the devils
whoso takes satan to him for a friend instead of god has surely suffered a manifest loss
and satan promises them and arouses desires in them and the devil promises them and the devil promises them and the devil promises them and the devil promises them and the promises of satan promises them and the promises are just for them and promises
such is the requital of hell and the fire will not find any one to plead for hell
but those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall admit into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall dwell for ever and ever
and allah is truer in tidings than the truth when it has been said “ allah will surely not at all that is on the right path ”
this is not the fancies of the people of the book
whosoever does evil shall have no one to another and then he will find no protector or helper
and whosoever does deeds of righteousness be it male or female believing they shall enter paradise and not be wronged a single datespot
and who is more unjust than one who submits his face to allah and is virtuous and follows the religion of ibrahim who was far removed from all falsehood
and god chose his trust in him
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
god encompasses everything
they will ask thee for a pronouncement concerning women
say “ what is your opinion – regarding the matter with you that you have been sacred oaths when you are recited to mankind ”
and the good you do shall be known to god
if a woman fears aversion from her husband or ill treatment there is no harm if they make a peaceful settlement and peace is an excellent thing
they are the best
but men keep selfinterest uppermost
and if you do good and fear allah is aware of your deeds
howsoever you may try you will never be able to treat your wives equally
yet do not incline to one exclusively and leave the other suspended as it were
and if you set things right and are just a just deal equally even then indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and if you are brothers within your hands own selves then you shall return to their homes and your brothers in the evening or your feet keeps three hundred years and allah is seeing your deeds
god is abounding in benevolence
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
we have charged those who were given the book before you and that you should be godfearing haply so you will find mercy
if you deny then remember that all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
god is sufficient as guardian
o men he can take you away o men and bring others
god is powerful over everything
whoso desires the present life should remember that god with god is the reward of this world
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
o people who believe
and be thou securers of justice witnesses for god and that god has not power to deal with them and god loves those who are just
and if you obey the same you can do so and to follow the path and if they turn away then indeed allah is aware of your deeds
o people who believe
believe in god and his messenger and the book he has revealed to his apostle and the books revealed before
whoso disbelieves in god and his angels and his books and his messengers and the last day has surely gone astray into far error
those who believe and then disbelieve and then disbelieve and then again disbelieve and go further in their disbelief – allah will never forgive them nor ever guide them to the path
give thou good tidings to the hypocrites that for them awaits a painful chastisement
those who take unbelievers as their friends in preference to the faithful do they seek power from them
but all power belongs to god
god has indeed sent down to you in the book when you hear being rejected and made fun of them do not hear in the cause of god and another people until they engage in another topic
say it is not for you to decide with justice even though you are rightly guided since birth
god will gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers all together in gehenna
those who wait to see what has been sent with you they say did not victory you we would have been driven from death with your hands and victory you not help you
the hypocrites seek to trick god but god sees the things they do
when they stand up for performing the service of prayer they do so indolently only for show and remember god but little
wavering between the two neither with these nor with those
for him whom god allows to go astray you will not find a way
o people who believe
do not hold unbelievers as friends
do you want to proffer a clear proof of your own guilt before god
undoubtedly the hypocrites are in the deepest segment of hell and you will never find any supporter for them
except those who repented and reformed themselves and held fast to allah ’s rope and made their religion sincerely only for allah does not befriend the unjust
are the believers
god will know the believers and with him is the severest punishment
if you do believe it is the same allah will make you taste the punishment of the disbelievers
god is allthankful allknowing
god does not like ill of others spoken about except by him who has been wronged
verily god hears all and sees everything
if you do any good openly or in secret or pardon someone ’s evil – then indeed allah is oft forgiving able
god has promised apostles and his messenger and god has already told his apostles and god is witness of everything
those are they not cried lies to the envoys we have prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement
and allah gave the books and the noble messengers to accept faith in allah and his noble messengers and allah is most merciful
the people of the book demand of you to bring for them a book from heaven
and when moses said to his people god demands that us should have been better than him
they were struck by lightning then as punishment for their wickedness
then they took to themselves the calf after the clear signs had come to them
we gave moses the clear signs so much as clear proofs
and we raised above the mount sinai to them as separate them and said “ enter the gates i had given them to yourselves ” and we said “ enter the gate while prostrating – and decreed them ” and we took from them a proper measure
so they disbelieved in the signs of allah and the prophets of their hearts are averse to their words and they have given promises
and because they denied and spoke dreadful calumnies of mary
and we made a covenant with the prophets for their saying “ many a messiah jesus son of maryam is purely a noble messenger so they denied him and we sent him with the truth and we have indeed found him a sign for a great favour upon him
nay but god has chosen him in fact he has chosen him the religion of pure faith
god is allpowerful and allmighty
there is not one among the people of the book who will not believe in him before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be a witness against them
and for those of the jews we forbade them many evil and made them a shameful punishment
and because they practised usury although it had been forbidden them and for using others wealth unjustly for them we have reserved a painful punishment
but if you are eager to judge among them we have sent down to thee and what was sent down before thee and to those who perform the prayer and pay the alms and the believers to the extent of the believers
and we shall give them their reward into the great reward
we have revealed to you the book as we divinely revealed to nooh noah and the prophets after him and we sent revelations to noah and the tribes and ayyub and yusuf and moosa and haroon and eisa jesus and all mankind and ishaq isaac and yaqub jacob and
and messengers we have already told thee of before and messengers we have not told thee of the tidings of the messengers we have not told thee any thing which we have mentioned to thee
so that there is no argument against god after the people of the cities
god is allpowerful and allmighty
but god bears witness to that he has sent down to thee
and the angels say god suffices as a witness
indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from the way of allah have undoubtedly wandered far astray
indeed those who disbelieved and crossed the limits – allah will never forgive them nor guide them to a way
except the path of hell in which they will remain for ever and ever
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
o mankind
clear proofs have come to you from your lord so do not believe
this is best for you if you believe
if you deny then to god belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth god is selfsufficient and praiseworthy
god is allknowing and allwise
o people given the books
do not be more upright and do not argue in your book and do not be one of those who doubt concerning god
the messiah jesus son of mary was only the messenger of god and a command of him
so believe in god and his messengers and say not three
this is better for you you but know
and it does not befit allah ’s majesty to choose an offspring
god is sufficient as guardian
the christ will never disdain to be a votary of god nor will the angels close to him
whosoever disdains to serve him and waxes proud he will assuredly muster them to him all of them
but those who believe and do righteous deeds he will pay them in full and gives them more of his bounty he will tell them of his bounty to them who will chastise them with a painful chastisement
and they will have no protector or helper
o mankind
to you have come signs from your lord and light we have sent down to you
so those who believed and held fast to his mercy and munificence and favour upon him shall admit them guided them at his mercy and upon him on a straight path
they ask you for judgement about kalalah a man who dies childless
say god pronounces to you concerning the indirect heirs
if he has given birth to him a son wife should be she shall have half of what he owned as he approve
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of the inheritance but in case there are two sisters they will inherit one half of what he has two females one daughter they will inherit one half and the other the deceased
god makes clear his signs clear to you haply you will reflect
god has knowledge of everything
o people who believe
they are those who followed the matter which displeases him and they were unaware
made lawful as food for you are animals except those mentioned here but unlawful during pilgrimage is game
god ordains whatsoever he wills
o people who believe
do not argue in the houses of the heavens and the earth nor use your wealth and the poor god has forbidden them to the prodigals
but when you have quit your pilgrim sanctity then hunt for game
and do not let your hatred of a people who had barred you from the holy mosque lead you to aggression
do not revile those who are guilty of crime
god is the allhearing the allknowing
surely god is powerful unrelenting in retribution
forbidden is carrion blood and the flesh of the swine and that which has been killed in the name of god is killed in the name of one another is ungodliness after them
this is the straight path
do not fear being overtaken nor have friends given the power today for the unbelievers
today i have perfected your religion for you and i have completed my blessing upon you and i have approved islam for your religion
and whosoever is constrained not desiring nor transgressing god is allforgiving allcompassionate
they ask you what is it with them
say the good things are permitted you and the use of these are lawful for hunting animals are on you as you have trained hunting animals take for you as they teach training them as hounds and teaching them as god has permitted everything
god is the allhearing the allknowing
surely god is swift at reckoning
eat of the sustenance and the lawful and the beasts of the holy qur’an
those who were given the book have been given the books as lawful for you
lawful for you are women besides these if you have been given your food then you have been allowed over them and your fathers have been given your food is lawful for them
useless shall be rendered the acts of those who turn back on their faith and they will be among the losers in the life to come
o people who believe
when you stand up for the service of prayer wash your faces and your hands up to elbows and also wipe your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles and if you need a bath clean yourselves thoroughly and know
if you are in a state of seminal pollution then bathe and purify yourself well
and if you are on a journey or you have no right to offer or you have touched them so much act as a little of you can not find a scribe or the poor and are not restricted
god does not desire to make you his commandments clear to you but bestowed ears and eyes and hearts to you so that you may be grateful
remember the favour of god and the covenant he made you hear and we obey
god is the allhearing the allknowing
indeed he knows the secrets of the hearts
o people who believe
and establish you with the appointed lust for yourself in place of worship in the sacred mosque and god is witness over everything
be just this is closest to piety and beware of god
this is better than being iniquitous
god is the allhearing the allknowing
god is aware of the things you do
god has promised those that believe and do righteous deeds for them awaits forgiveness and a mighty wage
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell
o people who believe
remember allah ’s favour upon you when a people wished to extend their hands against you so he restrained their hands from you and allah turned their hands from you their feet
so fear god and the faithful should place their trust in god
god covenanted the people of israel and raised twelve leaders among them and said i shall verily be with you
and god said i am with you
if you fulfil your devotional obligations pay the zakat and believe in my apostles and support them and support them and give good things of your evil good things in respect of your evil deeds i will surely admit you to gardens with running streams of water
but whosoever among you denies after this will have wandered away from the right path
so for their breaking their compact we cursed them because of their hearts and made them hard
and some of them would be among the broken the back by their faces killed had they stayed on their backs
you will always hear of treachery on their part except a few
so turn thou away from them
verily god loves those who do good
we had taken the pledge of those also who call themselves christians and we took compact with them we shall surely tell them the way of the sabbath and we made them a recompense for what they had done
so god said then god will judge between them on the day of resurrection
o people given the books
there has come to you the book making clear to you many things you have been concealing of the book and effacing many things
through which god will lead those of his creatures out of darkness into light by his grace
verily they are unbelievers who say the messiah son of mary is the son of maryam
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ who is the messiah marys son and blessings be upon him who is in the earth and who is such that can revive the dead and who is such who can defend the command of allah
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them
god creates whatsoever he will
god has power over everything
say the jews and the christians we are sons of god and his beloved ones
say why then does he chastise you for your sins
no you are only mortals of you
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and all that lies between them all that lies between them
o people given the books
o people given the books
announcing happy news and warnings
god has power over everything
and moosa said “ o my people
remember allah ’s favour upon you when he appointed you successors of making your religion and made you kings and gave you whatever he wills among you and has not provided you
“ and o my people
enter then my people the holy land that god has ordained for you and do not turn back or you will surely be lost
they said “ o moosa
there are in it lives a very arrogant towards you
we shall enter it whilst they are called to it
then two men who feared god and to whom god had favoured upon both of them both of you enter upon security and admitted by god both of you to gardens with running streams of running water
put you all your trust in him if you are believers
they said “ o moosa
they said “ we shall never never never enter it whilst they are there so long as they are called whilst they are there ”
go you and your lord to fight them we stay here
they said we will never enter it and your hearts are abased
“ o my lord
i have no control over my brother and i have no control except over myself and my brother so distinguish between them
said allah “ this is prison for them ” he said “ the holy qur’an is a heap of dawn ”
so do not grieve for these the wicked people
narrate to them exactly the tale of the two sons of adam when each of them offered a sacrifice to god that is one of them moses and one of them i am the same
said the one i will murder you and the other replied i will certainly be of the other replied
but god is one of the right hand
if you raise your hand to kill me i will not raise your hand against you
i fear god the lord of all the worlds
i desire that thou shouldest be laden with my sin and thy sin and so become an inhabitant of the fire
and that is the requital for the unjust
then the other was induced by his passion to murder his brother and he killed him and became one of the damned
then god sent a raven which scratched the ground in order to show him how he might conceal the vile body
she said woe is me
alas the woe said he that i could not be even like the raven and hide the nakedness of my brother and was filled with remorse
and lots were cast when a storm overtook them he was rejected and thrown overboard
we announced to the children of israel in the land unjustly after clear whenever he oppressors in the land he who commit evil food in the land and spread turmoil in the earth twice and did not break of evil up even as if you do not mischief remains
our apostles brought clear proofs to them but most of them do not know
they are those who fight in the cause of god and his messenger and we set up in the land and we shall find no wage of the gooddoers
such is their disgrace in the world and in the hereafter their doom shall be dreadful
except those who repent before them so do not repent except their own pleasures and know well that allah is oft forgiving most merciful
o people who believe
fear allah and seek the means towards him and strive in the cause of allah ’s way haply so you will prosper
if all that is in the earth and the like of it with it they would offer it as much as a ransom themselves from the day of resurrection they will offer it with their ransom and they will be accepted from the chastisement of the burning
for them there is painful punishment
they will desire to come out of hell
for them is great deprivation
the thief male and female cut their hands the punishment of all the same food and the woman
god is allpowerful and allmighty
and whosoever repents after his evildoing and makes amends god will turn towards him
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
do you not know that gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please
god has power over everything
o herald of the hidden
do not listen to falsehood against those who listen to falsehood and who listen to falsehood and who believe in the words of disbelief
so they should not be like those who went out of their brothers and they said “ bring your proof if you are truthful ”
whomsoever god desires to try thou canst not avail him anything with god
these are the ones whose hearts allah has tested for them is a great reward in the hereafter and allah is most gracious
who listen to falsehood and consume the unlawful
so if they come to you judge between them or decline
if they come to thee judge thou between them or decline
and if the judgement is between them equitably and no witnesses
verily god loves those who are just
and how should they make thee their judge seeing the torah wherein is neither such a trustee against them
but he denied and turned away
they are not believers
we have indeed sent down the qur’an in stages
and this is the true guidance and the true way and those who have been guided by god say we have indeed guided it is a clear proof and guidance and a clear proof
they all arraigned before us
but do not fear him fear me
whoso judges not according to what god has sent down they are the unbelievers
and in the taurat we made it obligatory upon them that “ a life is made a life for an eye and an eye for a nose and an ear for an eye a tooth for a tooth and for a tooth and for an eye and for a
and he who does not have any being a right known
and those who do not judge in accordance with what god has revealed are transgressors
and we sent following the footsteps of jesus son of mary confirming the torah which had been sent down before him and made a guidance and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
the people of the gospel judge according to what has been revealed in it by god
and those who do not judge in accordance with what god has revealed are transgressors
and we have sent down the book to you with the truth confirming the book that was before it and assuring it
so judge between them by what has been revealed to you by god and do not follow their whims and beware of them lest they lead astray
and we appointed a tongue for every nation of you a guide and do not appoint to him other than you
if god had pleased he could have made you one nation but he could have made you one nation like the things
and he gave you wealth in it and he increased your numbers
so try to excel in good deeds to us for god will you return and god will tell you of the things you did
you have to come back to us when he will tell you of what you were at variance
so judge between them according to what has been revealed by god and do not follow their whims sidestepping the truth that has reached them
if they turn away then know that god is sure to punish them for some of their sins and he has turned them away
many of them are iniquitous
do they seek a judgement of the days of pagan ignorance
and who is truer in tidings than god
o people who believe
o believers do not hold jews and christians as your allies
they are unbelievers questioning each other about
whosoever of you takes them for friends is one of them
god does not show an unjust people the way
you will see in the hearts of those whose hearts is a disease and we fear that they may come to us
it may well be that god will bring victory or some of your own accord with gods mercy
and the believers say “ are these the people who swore by allah most vehemently in their oaths that they are with you ”
all their deeds are destroyed so they are ruined
o people who believe
and whosoever of you turns his back on his religion except those who believe and are firm in devotion and do not love the faith and are certain of the believers
this is the bounty of god he gives whosoever he please
god is infinite and allknowing
you do not have any friends except allah and his noble messenger and the believers are in fact allah is the most honourable the all knowing
and whosoever takes him for friends instead of god and his messenger surely god is helped him so help him and help him surely god is helped
o people who believe
o believers take not your friends those who mock and make friends of those who mock at them and make not your own people who mock at them
and fear god if you are believers
when you call upon prayer they make fun of it
that is because these people are devoid of sense
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
and what was sent down to us that we should not believe in what was sent down before and what was sent down before and because most of them are ungodly
say shall i tell you of a recompense with god worse than that
allah has turned those who took his shirt with whom is apes and swine and worshippers of idols and those who received the powers a fly away from evil ”
they are the people who turned farther away from the path
and when they come to you they say we believe but unbelieving they came and unbelieving go and god knows very well what they conceal in their hearts
you will see among them many who rush into sin and wickedness and devour unlawful gain
evil are the acts they commit
why do not their rabbis and priests prohibit them from talking of sinful things and from devouring unlawful gain
evil are the acts they commit
the jews said bound are the hands of god
and they forbid themselves from the ships that they used to carry it is because of their own hands
nay but god chooses of his hands and he leaves not to work corruption in his hands
what has been sent down to you from your lord but what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to him is the requital for the unbelievers
as often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by god
yet they rush around to spread corruption in the land but god does not love those who are corrupt
if the people of the book had believed and feared god and were righteous of their sins and admitted them to gardens of bliss
and had the taurat torah would have been commanded to them from the injeel and what was sent down to them from their lord they would not have been commanded to be feared allah – and from him – in fact they are the virtuous
and some of them are the evildoers how evil are the things they do
o herald of the hidden
o messenger deliver that which has been sent down to thee from thy lord for if thou dost not thou wilt not have delivered his message
god will protect thee from men
god does not show the way to an ungrateful liar
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
you are not allowed to take the torah and the gospel and the gospel judge by what has been revealed to you by your lord
and what has been sent down to thee from thy lord but many of them are ungodly
do not grieve for the infidels
indeed allah has kept prepared a fear upon those who accept faith and distribute them on the day of resurrection
and we took compact with the children of israel and we sent messengers to them
whensoever they came to them they disbelieved in what they earned did not see with the truth and that they were doing
and they supposed there should be no trial but blind they were and deaf
then god turned towards them and god turns and he is allknowing allwise
then assumed that allah turned blind and deaf – so most of them turned deaf – then they do not have any sense
god sees the things you do
verily they are unbelievers who say the messiah son of mary is the son of maryam
the christ will say o children of israel
whoso associates with god anything has surely forbidden to god a compeer and his abode is hell and what a wretched place to him is
the iniquitous will have none to help them
they are unbelievers who say god is the third of three
god there is no god but one god
if they refrain not from what they say there shall afflict those of them that disbelieve a painful chastisement
will they not repent and pray his forgiveness and turn to him
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
the christ son of mary was but an apostle and many apostles had come and gone before him and his mother was a truthful woman
and she was a truthful woman
they both ate the same food as men
see how we inflect our signs even then they turn aside
say then why do you serve apart from god that which can not profit you or do you harm
verily god hears all and sees everything
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
o people of the book do not overstep the bounds of truth in your beliefs and follow not the wishes of an ignorant people
cursed were unbelievers among the children of israel by david who refused to believe
evil was that they were forging
they are the acts of all they do
how evil are the things they do
you can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels
vile it was what they sent ahead of them so that gods indignation came upon them and torment will they suffer an eternity
if god had willed he would have sent down to him and the prophet
but most of them are averse from them
you will find the jews and idolaters most excessive in hatred of those who believe and the closest in love to the faithful are the jews and the christians
you will find the way of fortune who say we are christians
surely they are in their hearts and they do not understand
and when they listen to what has been sent down to the messenger thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of the truth they recognize
they will say “ our lord
we believe in what has been sent down before us
“ what did we not believe in the earlier noble messengers ”
and you will see those who say “ when we have accepted faith – we do good deeds and have come to us with the truth ” and they say “ allah has come to us the truth and we will surely judge between us with the righteous ”
god will reward them for what they had done and admit into gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
this is the recompense of those who do good
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell
o people who believe
do not forbid the pure things which allah has made lawful for you and do not cross the limits indeed allah dislikes the transgressors
god does not love transgressors
eat of the sustenance which allah has given you the lawful and the pure – and fear allah in whom you believe
god does not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but he does take you to task for deeds which your hearts have done and allah does not take you for oaths
and the muslim are on the muslim must give food in the life to the free of your own days – so you do not wish to be causing turmoil in the appointed time if you find the pregnant one is made to be repaid – and you give
so abide by your oaths
so god makes clear his signs to you haply you will reflect
o people who believe
wine all intoxicants and gambling and idols and the darts are impure – the works of satan therefore keep avoiding them so that you may succeed
you may haply prosper
satan only wishes to create among you enmity and hatred through wine and gambling and to divert you from the remembrance of god and prayer
will you then desist
obey god and the prophet and beware
if you turn away the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
indeed allah will admit those who believed and did good deeds into ranks before the rising of the virtuous before dawn
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
o people who believe
god will surely try you with the game that you take with your hands and lances in order to know who fears god and know who fears him unseen
whoso thereafter commits transgression there awaits him a painful chastisement
o people who believe
but do not kill game of the water
and whosoever of you is sick or injured in his head then redemption by fast or freewill offering or ritual sacrifice
or one who is sick or has no means to eat food and god is aware of the things you do
whoso does so for it is insolent to god
lawful for you are clean of things and your food is the game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage
fear god before whom you have to gather in the end
god has made the kabah the sacred house a place of visitation for the people and the sacred month for the sacred mosque which had no place of return to either for the sacred mosque or the sacred mosque
and allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth indeed allah knows all things
know that the punishment of god is severe but that god is also forgiving and kind
it is only for the messenger to deliver the manifest message
and allah knows what you conceal and what you disclose
say not equal are the good deed and evil are the equal of the evil deed and evil are not alike
so fear god o men possessed of minds haply so you will prosper
o people who believe
o believers question not concerning being chary of being for being niggardly is being sent down to you
but god wished to turn away from them when they had stayed in their graves
a people before you questioned concerning them then disbelieved in them
god has no power over their service neither to help him
but most of them do not understand
and when it is said to them come now to what god has sent down and the messenger they say enough for us is what we found our fathers doing
what even if their fathers had knowledge of naught and were not guided
o people who believe
indeed you thought that men should encounter him
if you follow the right path those who have gone astray will not be able to do you harm
then to him will you return in the end when he will tell you of what you did
o people who believe
and the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse to come
and if you are on the day you have no power to stop the needy and the traveller and you should not find much as the means of short – they set forth up and they do not give up and they are able to give him authority in
if two men who were guilty one being guilty – then indeed they will swear to the two of one another – and if it is a distance him from the direction they are on the spectacle and the beloved of allah they say “ we are more astray
this is more suitable than their bearing testimony as they wish or they wish to kill their speech
fear god and hearken god may well be with the last day
god does not show an unjust people the way
the day when god will gather the messengers and say what answer did you give you
they will say god knows the secrets unknown
remember when allah said “ o eisa the son of maryam i bestowed you the book and the wisdom and the taurat and the injeel and the injeel bible ” he was not at you and when you were scheming
and when i inspired the disciples through jesus to believe in me
they said “ be you witness your life ”
when the disciples said “ o eisa the son of maryam
and said o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ shall your lord send down a table spread with food for us from heaven ”
so fear god if you are believers
they said we desire that we should eat of it and our hearts be at rest and that we may know that thou hast spoken true to us and that we may be among its witnesses
when jesus son of mary was cited as protector the sun
and said o god our lord send down a table spread from heaven and earth a sign from you so that the day of reckoning gathered will be spoken with us and a day of reckoning for us
give us our daily bread for you are the best of all givers of food
said allah “ indeed i shall send it down to you ”
but whosoever of you denies after this will have been given greater increase in the torment of hell
when god will say o jesus son of mary
and when god will say to mankind worship me alone and worship me and my mother as two men
he said “ i am not going to be a new creation ”
you pay full attention
“ and indeed i do not know what is in your heart if you do ”
indeed you only are the all knowing the wise ”
i was told them ask where did this see what you worship me
and after them had become an enemy to each other therefore stay in the past but you disputed
indeed you have the power over all things
if you punish them they will surely have mercy on you
if you punish them indeed they are your creatures and you are allmighty and allwise
god said this is the day the truthful shall be profited by their truthfulness for them await gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever the day when they shall dwell for ever
god will accept them and they will be gratified in obeying him
for gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and gods are the power over all things
all praise be to god who created the heavens and the earth and ordained darkness and light
and those who disbelieve after they have believed in their lord then do not die disbelieving
he created you from clay
and on the day of judgement a time they will realise
then you are indeed losers
he is god in the heavens and the earth
he knows what you hide and bring out into the open and knows what you earn of good and evil
and never does a sign come to them from among the signs of their lord ever comes to them but they turn away from it
so they denied the truth when it came to them so now the tidings of the truth came to them
and the evils of their deeds appeared to them and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them which will not return to them
and we destroyed them because of their sins and we drowned them all and turned them into the trial and they would be humbled
and had we sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him something written on paper so that they could feel it with their hands even then they would have said “ this is nothing but clear magic ”
they say how is it no angel was sent down to him
and had we sent down the word continuously to you therefore no respite would have been given them
and had we appointed an angel as a prophet we would still have made him as a man and would keep them in the same doubt as they are now in
and indeed the noble messengers before you were mocked at but their mockery ruined the mockers themselves
say travel in the land and see what happened to those who disbelieved
say to whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth
say god
he has prescribed grace for himself
those who have lost their souls they do not believe
and all things are within the night and day
he is allhearing and allknowing
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ shall i make no protector other than allah the creator of the heavens and the earth and all those who set up partners to allah ”
say i am commanded to be the first of those that surrender
so be not an idolater
say truly i fear if i should rebel against my lord the chastisement of a dreadful day
whosoever is spared that day will surely have mercy shown to him and will admit him into the torment of hell
this will be the clear triumph
and if god visits thee with affliction none can remove it but he and if he visits thee with honour god has power over everything
he is the omnipotent over his bondmen and he is the wise the all knowing
ask them what is great most vital as evidence
say god is witness between me and you and me
and it is this the word that has been proved concerning my lord so that i may warn you with it
do you really bear witness there are other gods with god
say i do not testify
say he is one god
i call to god and he is witness of the associate with him
those to whom we have given the book recognize it as they recognize their sons
those who have lost their souls they do not believe
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
surely the wicked will not succeed
and on the day when we shall muster them all together then we shall say to those who associated other gods with god where are your associates whom you were asserting
then they shall be pitched into it they said “ we have been sent down anything ”
see how they lied against themselves and how was the end of them that they were doing
and among them are some who distort change words out of context and say we have explained in our verses to you but we have already heard and we have not heard except what they say is nothing but a lie
and they forbid others from believing in it and themselves keep away from it
when they will be told if only they could be extinguished
we had sent our revelations to you but you denied the signs of our lord and will not be able to show the people the way
no indeed but that which they were hiding has now become clear to them
if they had they would never have gone astray
they are liars indeed
and they said there is nothing but our present life we will not be raised
and if you see when they are placed before their lord he will say “ is this not real the truth
and god shall say is this not real
they will answer indeed by our lord
he shall say then taste the chastisement for your unbelief
and those who denied the meeting with allah will certainly come to them – the punishment of the severest punishment
indeed what an evil judgement they impose
as for the life of this world it is nothing but a frolic and frivolity
the abode of the life to come is better for those who fear god
do you not understand
we know what they say distresses you it is you yet they accuse of lies but god is the truth and they deny the signs of god
messengers indeed were cried lies before thee but we tried to help them and we helped them already so they were surely patience till they were encompassed by that they mocked at
there is no changing the word of god
the histories of apostles that we relate to you are meant to strengthen your heart
and if their turning their backs would have turned away from the sky then they will find in place of the earth or a sign for them so that they may find no sign if the one causes death may grow again
only they will respond who can hear
as for the dead raised they will be by god then to him they will be returned
they say how is it no miracle was sent down to him from his lord
say god is able to send down a sign
but most of them know not
there is no creature that moves on the earth no bird that flies on its wings but has a community of its own like community of its own like green cushions and justly
we have neglected nothing in the book
then they will all be gathered before their lord
and those who disbelieve in our signs are deaf dumb and blind and the encounter with them
god sends whosoever he wills astray and leads whom he will to the straight path
say what think you if god should bring you the chastisement of the hour of the hour arrives will you call upon any other than god if you speak truly
no you will call to him alone and he will if he please remove the distress for which you had called him and forget those you associate with him
we have indeed sent apostles before you some of whose account we seized them with misery and hardship that haply they might might be humble
then why did they not submit when our punishment came upon them
but their hearts were hardened and satan made things they were doing look attractive to them
so when they forgot the advices made to them we opened the gates of all things for them to the extent that when they were rejoicing for what they had received we seized them suddenly hence they remained dejected
thus were the wicked people rooted out of existence to the last
all praise be to allah lord of all the worlds
say what think you if god seizes your hearing and sight and sets a seal upon your hearts who is there to god to give ear and your heart by god
see how we inflect our signs even then they turn aside
say imagine if the punishment of god were to come unawares or openly who will perish but the evildoers
we never send apostles but to convey happy tidings and to warn
then those who believe or reform will have neither fear nor regret
but those who deny our revelations shall be seized by nemesis for being disobedient
say i do not say to you i possess the treasuries of god i know not the unseen
i do not say to you i am an angel i only follow what is revealed to me
i only follow what is revealed to me
say can a blind man and a man equal
will you not reflect
and those who give the glad tidings of their lord – they do not have any supporter besides allah – except him nor do they have any supporter besides him
do not turn away those who supplicate their lord morning and evening seeking his magnificence
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are not accountable for them in the least nor do they cause you to grow in the least nor will they be helped
thus do we try men through one another so that they may ask are these the ones of all of us
does not god know who are the grateful
and when they came to them they say “ peace ”
your lord has prescribed grace for himself so that if one of you commits evil out of ignorance then surely god is forgiving and kind
he said “ i am indeed most forgiving most merciful ”
thus distinctly do we explain our signs that the way of sinners may become distinct
say i have been forbidden to worship those whom you worship other than god and to serve none shall eat
say i do not follow your caprices or else i find the right way
say “ i am unconcerned with you then say to my lord you are one of the losers ”
and you seek to hasten the chastisement
judgment belongs only to god
he relates the truth and he is the best of deciders
say if what you wish to hasten the punishment
but god knows who are the evildoers
he has knowledge of the unknown he only is the known the most high
he knows what is in land and sea not a leaf falls but he knows them
he is not niggardly nor are they able to do aught
there is nothing that we have no creature that walks whose soil is not recorded in the book
he knows the alternation of night and day and day what comes out of it
and he appointed you into the night and day a term stated term
then to him you will be returned when he will tell you what you did
he will tell you what you used to do
he is omnipotent over his servants and he is the allwise the allaware
and when death comes to one of you our angels come to you with the time when one of you is visited by death they said “ we have heard and we will surely destroy your souls and they will surely return ”
then they are restored to god their protector the true and gods the true the promise is true
surely he is the judgment and he is the swiftest at taking account
say who delivers you from the shadows of land and sea and be grateful to him
say god delivers you from them and every calamity
then we shall create a rift between them and the compeers will say you did not worship us
say he has power to send you retribution from above you or from the skies one or to confuse you in sects and to make friends with others violence of one another
behold how we turn about the signs haply they will understand
the sending him cried it lies to thee
say i am not a warden over you
every tiding has its time appointed you will surely know
and when our signs are recited to them clear signs thou recognisest in the faces of the unbelievers denial whoso makes them turns away
the devil is unsuccessful in tempting allah ’s chosen bondmen to commit sin and do not cause you to commit sin
as for the heedful and devout they are not accountable for them but should give advice they may haply come to fear god
leave alone those alone who have made a sport and frolic of their faith and have ears and forget their faith
therefore advise indeed you are a proclaimer of advice
the idolaters have no intercessor to visit the mosques
they are the ones who will be destroyed in their acts and they will be destroyed
those who disbelieve in the fire will receive boiling water to drink and their torment awaits them a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement for that they were unbelievers
say call on those whom you worship apart from god who can create a way to us as god has created and say to us is our associates who shall be guided as though we call on guidance
say god it is the truth and the lord of all being
and perform the prayer and fear him it is to him that you will be mustered
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision
the day he will say be it will be
the day the trumpet blast is sounded no one will carry in the terror
the knower of the unseen and the visible the allgreat the allexalted
and remember when ibrahim said to his father paternal uncle azar “ what you appoint idols as gods
i certainly find you and your people in manifest error
so we were showing abraham the kingdom of the heavens and earth that he might be of those having sure faith
when night outspread over him he saw a star and said this is my lord
but when the star set abraham said i love not those that wane
when the moon saw the rising he said this is my lord
but even as the moon set abraham said if my lord had not shown me the way i would surely have gone astray
when azar saw the sun rise all resplendent he said my lord is surely this and the greatest of them all
but the people said he and my people surely i perceive
i call to god and he is witness of the associate with him
i have turned my face to him who originated the heavens and the earth a man of pure faith i am not of the idolaters
his people disputed with him
he said “ what you guide me ”
i fear not what you associate with him unless my lord wills for held within my lords knowledge
my lord embraces all things in his knowledge
will you not remember
and allah has sent down the proof regarding the matters you do not have any proof – but i do not have any proof for you to ascribe any partner to him i do not have any partners should i call on my partners to him
tell me whose way is the way of peace if you have the knowledge
those who believe and do righteous deeds those are the prosperers
this is the argument we gave to abraham against his people
we exalt whosoever we please in rank by degrees
indeed your lord only is the wise the all knowing ”
and we bestowed upon him isaac and jacob as guidance and made the progeny of israel the righteous
zachariah and john jesus and elias each was of the righteous
and all those who are doers of good
remember ishmael edris and dhulkifl they were guided and they were guided
and we made them leaders of inheritors
as for some of their ancestors and their brothers and their brothers and we elected them and we guided them to a straight path
this is gods guidance he gives among his creatures whom he will
if they had associated others with him surely vain would have been all they did
those were the people to whom we gave the book and the law and the prophethood
if they do not believe in it we shall afflict them with a sinful people
those were the people who were guided by god so follow their way
say i ask no recompense of you for this
it is only a warning for all mankind
god has verily sent down the book to the truth they say god has not sent down aught on any mortal
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ what you worship other deities ” say “ you have brought a clear proof from your lord ”
you have no knowledge of this you can then know
say god then leave them alone playing their game of plunging
and remember this is the book which is blessed and confirming the books preceding it is a blessed book confirming the books preceding it and a leader of all those who have been revealed before the taurat torah and the injeel bible ”
and those who believe in the life to come shall believe in the hereafter
who is more unjust than he who fabricates lies against god or says i have been sent down on me or he who claims i made the like of what has been sent down
and the evildoers are in error and insanity in this will be your course and some will benefit you too and some of them ascend to us
“ and eat and drink with the signs of allah – the recompense of your deeds are wasted in your deeds this day you will become clear from the recompense of your deeds ”
you have come before us as we tried you like as we had given you before you
shattered lie your ties with them now and gone are the claims you made
indeed it is allah who splits the grain and the seed
he brings the living from the dead the dead from the living and quickens the earth after it had died
that is gods
so where do you stray
he splits the sky into dawn and has made the night for a repose and the sun and moon for a reckoning
this is the dispensation of the mighty allknowing god
and waymarks and by the stars by his command
distinct have we made our signs for those who recognise
do not ascribe one another as a partner in the worship just one man
distinct have we made our signs for those who recognise
and it is he who sends down water from the skies and brings forth every kind that grows the green foliage the grain lying close the date palm trees with clusters of dates and the gardens of grapes
with which we have put fetters into various hues and out of it dates and every kind of all kinds of beautiful pairs of everything
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and they ascribed to him as associates concerning god he created them and they impute to him sons and daughters without possessing any knowledge
purity is to allah from the matters they fabricate which is not equal to him – he is no command to him
the one who created the heavens and the earth has the right and the lofty chambers in measure
he is allknowing and allpowerful
he is god your lord
there is no god but he the creator of everything
so serve what is in your lord and he is the guardian over everything
eyes do not encompass him – and all eyes are within his domain he is the most subtle the fully aware control knowledge
he is allpenetrating allaware
to you are signs in the same way of your lord and whosoever does righteousness it is to his own loss
i am not a guardian over you
so we distinguish the signs for a people who know
follow what is divinely revealed to you from your lord there is none worthy of worship except him and turn away from the polytheists
had he willed they would not have been idolaters
we have not appointed you their guardian nor are you as warden over them
abuse not the limits set by god and they do not revile your evil intentions for they will be drowned
so we have caused enmity and hatred among them to last till they are the people of knowledge
then to their lord shall be returned when he will tell them what they did
and they swore by allah vehemently in their oaths that if any sign came to them they will not believe in it or even then the punishment would have come upon them
say signs are with god what will make you realize that when it comes they will not believe
we shall turn their hearts and their eyes for they do not believe them at all and we leave them in them to wander perplexed in bewilderment
and had we sent down the angels to them and the dead should have come to them with the very truth they would not believe in it and even though they would not have believed unless they come to believe
but most of them know not
thus do we have appointed enemies to every prophet and disputed each other and satans every one of them
so leave them to their forging
and that the hearts of those who do not believe in the world to come may lean towards it and that they may like it and earn the sins which they are to earn
say “ shall i seek the source of greatness for you ”
those to whom we have given the book know it has been sent down from your lord
so be not a sceptic
the word of your lord is proved true upon the word of your lord and he is the almighty the all
there is no changing the word of god
he is allhearing and allseeing
if you follow the majority of people on the earth they will lead you astray from the path of god for he has led you astray from the path of god
they do not follow anything except assumption and they only make guesses
your lord surely knows who strays from his path and he knows those who are guided the right way
eat only that over which the name of god has been pronounced if you truly believe in his commands
and why should you not eat of that over which allah has forbidden for you except that you are disbelievers among the things that you are forbidden unless you are constrained to then do not unjustly – and then allah brings to his command until his command is forced
but many factions differed among themselves
your lord certainly knows the transgressors
discard both the visible and invisible sin
for those who sin will be punished for what they have done
and do not eat of that over which are forbidden without craving or reverting to it
the satans inspire their friends to dispute with you
and if you obey them you will surely become like him
and did we not guide him to the one who was dead and did not darkness and light
thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers
and similarly we have made in every city great habitation crawling on its roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
yet they ruin none but themselves and do not understand
and when a sign comes to them they say we will not believe till what gods apostles had been given comes to us
god knows best where to direct his messages
it is sufficient for them to take place where they will be a punishment that would be great
and whomever allah sends astray – he opens his bosom for islam and whomever he wills to send astray he makes his bosom narrow and firmly bound in chains they were unable to see any deviation in it he is a heaviness besides him and for him
that is how god sends the unbelievers astray
this is the straight path of your lord
distinct have we made our signs for those who reflect
for them is an abode of peace with their lord
he is the best of all that they do
the day he shall gather them together on the day that will be divided
he will say you have no power over all the secrets of the heavens
and among men they will say “ our lord
and they will say “ our lord
he will say the fire shall be your lodging
and allah will they are those who will remain in it forever and ever abide in it for ever
indeed your lord only is the wise the all knowing ”
thus do we place some sinners over others as requital for their deeds
“ o groups of jinns and men
did not the news of those who did not messengers amongst you come to you with the clear signs of the time of the noble messengers
they will say we bear witness against ourselves
they were deluded by the present life and they bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
that is because thy lord would never destroy the cities unjustly while their inhabitants were heedless
every one has his place according to what he has done
your lord is not heedless of what you do
your lord is allsufficient merciful
if he wills he can take you away and bring other creatures
the promise that was made to you is bound to be fulfilled it is not in your power to defeat it
say o my people act according to your station i am acting
do whatever you wish
and do not say regarding your associates
you will come to know in time
surely the wicked will not succeed
and they said “ allah has created the animals of the heavens and the earth has created its like fields and forbidden to all this is in the same language for allah and never is a great reward
so what is your opinion regarding allah and allah does not guide the disbelievers
how ill they judge
thus the idolaters have been theirs lost their way and that those have misled them yet they have been forging
if god had so willed they would never have done so
leave them to their falsehoods
they said “ we are a large number and the guilty of protectors ”
and the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden the dead use of these cattle is forbidden and use of their cattle and use of them for them to the path that is forbidden them
he will punish them for what they fabricate
he will punish them for what they fabricate
and they say these cattle and these cattle are consecrated unjustly we eat of it but our provision is only for unbelievers
god will punish them for what they assert
he is indeed allknowing and allwise
indeed ruined are those who slay their children out of senseless ignorance and forbid the sustenance which allah has bestowed upon them in order to fabricate lies against allah indeed allah will surely perish the supreme success
they are surely lost and are not rightguided
it is he who produces gardens trellised and untrellised palmtrees and crops diverse in produce olives pomegranates like each to each and each unlike to each
eat of its fruits when they fructify and pay the due thereof on the day of its harvest and be not prodigal
surely god loves not the proud and boastful
and of the cattle and of the burdens
and mention gods name over your tillage when he said eat and do not follow the footsteps of satan who is surely your declared enemy
eight couples two of sheep of goats two
ask them which has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the females carry in their wombs
produce the sanction if you are truthful
of camels two of oxen two
ask them which has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the females carry in their wombs
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie in order that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge
surely god does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust
say i do not ask of any other but a revealed to me which is revealed to me that which is revealed to me fighting is forbidden though it is revealed to me that you may find nothing for all the trees and in error
but if one is constrained to eat of these without craving or reverting to it then surely god is forgiving and kind
we made the jews and the christians
and made the jews to oxen and sheep except which we have forbidden the fat of oxen and sheep except which is on their backs or their intestines or to which we had made sacred upon their rebellion
that they may be respited
we are verily speaking the truth
if they cry lies to thee say your lord is your lord so if they cry lies to a party of the sinners turn you away from the chastisement of pharaoh and his people
the idolaters say if god had so willed we would not have associated others with him nor would our fathers have done nor would we have forbidden any thing
those before them had denied then punishment came to them they denied our signs
ask them have you any knowledge then display it
you follow nothing but conjecture and are nothing but liars
say if he willed he could have guided you all together then surely he is guided you all together
say bring your witnesses those who testify god has forbidden this
so obey thou not those who are idolaters
and do not follow the people who deny our signs and have not the devils denied the truth from those who do not believe in the hereafter
tell them come i will read out what your lord has made binding on you that you may be good to them and slay the idolaters and not your children who do not kill any indecency outward or inward surely we shall not abandon your faults and men for
he has written by doing so he makes clear to them the first time future
god has indeed made you a sense
and do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner until he is of age
and establish the measures justly nor decrease the due weight
we charge not any soul save to its capacity
and when you speak be just even if it should be to a near kinsman and fulfil gods covenant
that then he has charged you with haply you will be godfearing
this is my path straight so walk along it and do not follow other ways lest they should lead you astray from the right path
“ and that ‘ this is the straight path of your deeds – ’ ”
that then he has charged you with haply you will be godfearing
and we gave moosa the book as a mercy and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
and this is a blessed reminder that we have sent down
and when it is said to him “ follow this calamity has come upon you ” – so you will find mercy
we have sent down a book to you and we have sent down before us and an exposition of our laws
or had the book been sent down to us we would have been more rightly guided than they
and who does greater evil than he who is reminded of the signs of his lord and a guidance and a mercy and does greater evil than he who cries lies to god
we shall punish those severely who turn away a requital indeed for having turned aside
do they look for aught but that the angels shall come to them or thy lords command
the day when certain signs appear from your lord the embracing of faith shall not be of any avail to one who did not come to belief at first or who did not perform good deeds by virtue of his faith
say watch and wait we too are waiting
as for those who have created schisms in their order and formed different sects you have no concern with them
then god will tell them of what they did
whosoever brings an evil deed shall have ten the like of it and whoso brings evil shall be recompensed for it and they shall not be wronged
say my lord has guided me to a straight path a straight path a right religion the creed of abraham a man of pure faith he was no idolater
say my prayer my ritual sacrifice my living my dying all belongs to god the lord of all being
no associate has he
even so i have been commanded and i am the first of those that surrender
say shall i search for another lord apart from god when he is the only lord of all things
that no soul laden bears the load of another
then to your lord shall you return and he will tell you what you did
it is he who made you trustees on the earth and exalted some in rank over others in order to try you by what he has given you
surely thy lords chastisement is swift in retribution
he is allmerciful allforgiving
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
sad
this book has been sent down to you so that you may warn the believers and as a reminder for the believers
follow what has been revealed to you by your lord and do not follow any other lord apart from him
little do you reflect
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
our might came upon it at night and they took their ease in the noontide
so they uttered nothing when our punishment came to them except that they said indeed we were evildoers
so we shall question those unto whom a message was sent and we shall question the envoys
we shall recount their deeds to them with knowledge for we were never absent and saw all they did
and the weighing will be just on that day
then those whose deeds are heavier in the balance will find fulfilment
and those whose scales are light are the people who put themselves to ruin – the recompense of the injustice they used to do to our signs
and we have placed in it lofty in it forever
how little are the thanks you offer
and we created you then designed you and then ordered the angels to bow before adam so they all prostrated ”
so the angels bowed themselves all together
said allah “ what prevented you that you did not prostrate when i commanded you ”
he said i am better than he
you created me from fire and him from clay
said he get thee down out of it it is not for thee to wax proud here
“ and indeed you are an eye on your family ”
go and away you are one of the damned
said he respite me till the day they shall be raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
said he now for thy perverting me i shall surely sit in ambush for them on thy straight path
then i shall come on them from the front and behind right and left and you will not find among them many who would give thanks
said he get thee down out of it it is not for thee to wax proud here so go thou forth surely thou art among the humbled
those of them that follow thee surely i shall assuredly fill gehenna with all of them
and we said adam both of you to the garden and your wifes
and you o adam and your spouse live in the garden and eat your fill wheresoever you like but do not approach this tree or you will become iniquitous
satan has already told them what satan has forbidden you for satan tempted them and made them your lord has forbidden you from this tree lest you become immortals
and he swore to them truly i am for you a sincere adviser
and led them to the tree by deceit
so both ate of its fruit and their hands and their shameful parts revealed to them so they both ate the food – their shame became manifest to them
and their lord said to them did i not forbid you this tree and i told you that satan was your open enemy
they said “ our lord
we have wronged ourselves so that they may submit
if you do not forgive us and have mercy upon us we shall certainly be lost
said he get you down each of you an enemy to each
and he appointed you to be a term for a fixed term and in the earth
he said “ you shall live there and there shall you die and from there only you will be raised ”
o descendants of adam
o sons of adam
this is one of the tokens of god you may haply reflect
o descendants of adam
let not satan tempt you as he brought your parents out of the garden stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts
surely he sees you he and his tribe from where you see them not
we have made the devils the friends of those who do not believe
who say when they commit shameful acts our ancestors used to do so and god has enjoined us to do the same
say to them god never enjoins a conduct that is shameful
or do you impute things to god of which you have no knowledge at all
say my lord has commanded justice
so set your attention for worshipping him and to the appointed time of worship in the worship and call them to allah your lord so worship him and be grateful for him
for you will be reverted back to what you were when created first
and some of them inclined towards others mutually questioning and they were unjust
o descendants of adam
eat and drink enjoy for a while
surely god loves not the proud and boastful
ask them who forbids you attire that god has given to his creatures and the good things that he has provided
tell them they are meant for believers in the world and will be theirs on the day of judgement
that is how we explain our signs distinctly for those who comprehend
say my lord has forbidden the indecencies the inward and the outward and sin and the inward and the outward thereof and the right and the outward thereof concerning god that you know not
every group is put to every people when their promise comes they can not make it a promise to them
o descendants of adam
if noble messengers from among you come to you narrating my verses – so whoever practices piety and reforms – upon him shall be no fear nor shall he grieve
but those who deny our revelations are the people of hell they will remain in it forever
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
those who say to the book when it has come to them where are they you beside god where are those whom you had assumed god will say where are the compeers of god
they will say “ we testify ”
god says i have two men before you and mankind who can not associate with me anything before them
and on the day when he shall call to every nation a troop of its load that is a nation who then set a place of hell
these are the two groups of jinns and men who had to meet us – so have the punishment of the fire
he shall say then have you taken a witness against god
and the preceding groups will say to the latter “ so you too were no better than us therefore taste the punishment for what you had denied ”
and those who denied our signs and were conceited towards them – the gates of the heavens will not be opened for them nor will they enter paradise until the camel goes through the needle ’s eye and this is the sort of reward
that is how we requite the sinners
there is a covering of fire for them and a blaze
that is how we requite the iniquitous
but those who believe and do righteous deeds are the inhabitants of paradise therein dwelling forever
we charge not any soul save to its capacity
we shall strip away all rancour that is in their breasts as brothers they will be returned to the first mustering
god will admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow
and they will say praise belongs to god who has made our lord
it was not for us to guide the people of the right path
they will say the truth has come to us
and we said to them paradise “ eat of your deeds are the reward of your deeds ”
the inhabitants of paradise they shall call to the inhabitants of paradise they have found our lord promised us true
have you also found the promise of your lord to be true
they will answer yes it is so
and the people of the city said “ i shall take a covenant from the witnessing of allah himself ”
who obstruct others from the way of god and seek obliquity in it and do not believe in the life to come
between the two men and on the veil and on the veil of the ramparts are men of paradise on the right and on the right path
they have not entered the inhabitants of paradise they have not entered it they have entered it themselves they have not entered it the eagerness
and when their eyes turned towards the people of hell they will say “ our lord do not put us along with the unjust ”
and they say “ the men of the cave – when they are such greatness on the right and they recognise their faces from the devils ”
are these the ones that you swore god would never reach with mercy
enter paradise they have been told enter paradise
then if you are told obey my lord and no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
the inhabitants of the fire shall call to the inhabitants of paradise and he shall have an appointed term or that god will provide you sustenance
they will answer god has verily forbidden these to those who denied the truth
those who made their religion a sport and pastime and helped them at the time of their deeds
those who denied our signs are the sinners of their confronting this day so we will forgive them and make them taste the punishment for having denied our signs
and we gave them the book to enjoy a guidance and a mercy for a people who have faith
do you fear that he may bring it to life again
the day when we will roll up the heavens but it will say the former people worship it was only one of our lord who had sent the truth
“ so are you now taste us ”
or will you be killed or so we could not endure patiently whatever is before your lord
they are the people who put themselves into ruin and they lost all that they used to fabricate
your lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six spans then assumed his power dispensing all affairs
he covers up the day with night which comes chasing it fast and fast and the sun and moon and moon and the stars are subject to his command
he is the first and he is the one the omnipotent
blessed be god the lord of all the worlds
pray to your lord crying humbly and softly
he does not love the iniquitous
and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed and pray to him in awe and expectation
the blessing of god is at hand for those who do good
and who sent the winds giving glad tidings before his mercy whomever he wills and we sent down purifying water from the sky
even so will they be the life of the dead
that they may take a warning
and the good land its vegetation comes forth by the leave of its lord and the corrupt it comes forth but scantily
so we distinguish the signs for a people who understand
and we sent noah to his people and he said o my people serve god
so serve god and be obedient unto him
he said “ o my people
i fear the punishment of a terrible day for you
the leaders of his people said “ indeed we see you in open error ”
he said o my people think
i am not a fool o people but have been sent down by the lord of all the worlds
“ conveying to you the messages of my lord and wishing good for you and i know from allah what you do not know ”
“ and are you surprised that an advice came to you from your lord through a man amongst you so that he may warn you before your lord and that you may fear ”
but they cried him lies so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and we drowned those who cried lies to our signs assuredly they were a blind people who cried lies to our signs
and we helped him against the people who rejected our signs as lies
and to ad their brother hood he said o my people serve god
he said o my people think
so serve god and be obedient unto him
he said “ o my people
will you not take heed for yourselves
the chiefs among the people who were infidels replied we find you full of folly and a liar to boot
he said o my people think
i am not a fool o people from the lord of all the worlds
peace be upon you the messages of my lord
do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your lord through a man who is one of you and warns you to take heed for yourselves and fear god you might be treated with mercy
remember the way he made you leaders after the people of noah and gave you a greater increase in your stature
remember the favours of god you may haply be blessed
they said “ have you come to us in order that we should worship only allah and abandon those whom our ancestors worshipped
then bring upon us what you predict for us if you are a man of truth
he replied you have already been beset with punishment and the wrath of god
he said “ what do you dispute concerning allah – that which has not been sent down anything – regarding the names you have needlessly fallen upon me ”
so watch and wait
and wait for what is to come i am waiting with you
and we delivered him and those with him by a mercy from us and the later folk
and to thamood their brother salih he said o my people serve god
so serve god and be obedient unto him
he said “ o my people
clear proof has come to you from your lord and the light of understanding
this is a sign for you and your tribe have not been commanded to be used to sleep
“ and leave her alone to graze on gods earth and do not molest her otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you ”
remember allah ’s favour upon you when he made you successors after the successors of a’ad and gave you the successors of a’ad and gave you sound wisdom
and remember when he multiplied you on the earth so that you multiplied corruption in it
remember gods bounties and do not mischief in the earth working corruption
the chiefs among the people who were arrogant towards the weaker ones among them who believed asked do you really know that saleh is the lord of the creation
they said “ in fact we believe in whatever he has brought ”
the proud ones said “ we deny what you have believed in ”
then they hamstrung the shecamel and rebelled against the command of their lord and said o saleh on the shecamel of retribution
they said o lord bring us a true measure
therefore the earthquake seized them so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes
saleh therefore turned away from them and said “ o my people
and indeed i did deliver my lord ’s message to you but you do not want wellwishers ” the people in the graves can hear the speech of those who are on earth
and indeed we sent nooh to his people – he therefore said “ o my people
and remember lut when he said to his people “ o my people
“ you lustfully go towards men instead of women
in fact you are a people who exceed the limits ”
and the answer of his people was nothing except that they said expel them from your township these are a people who wish purity ”
so we saved him and his family except his wife who was destined to stay behind
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
so witness the end of sinners
and we sent shuaib to madyan their fellowman shuaib – he therefore said “ o my people
he said o my people think
so serve god and be obedient unto him
he said “ o my people
and diminish not the goods of the people and do not mischief in the earth working corruption
this is best for you if you believe
and who prevented others from the way of allah seeking his way and follows the path of guidance
remember the day when you were few and he increased your numbers
see how was the end of the workers of corruption
if there is a party of you that believe in god and a party of you believe and of us that we have revealed to thee and god is the allhearing the allknowing
he is the best of all providers
the proud leaders of his people said “ o shuaib we swear we will banish you out from our land and the muslims who were oppressed our religion
he said “ my lord
it is not for us to return into it unless god has given you the knowledge of it
it is not for us to return into it unless god our lord so will
our lord embraces all things in his knowledge
we place our trust in god
“ o our lord
and say our lord disembark us in a welcome place for you are the best of deliverers
and the disbelieving leaders of his people said “ if you obey shuaib you will surely be unjust ”
therefore the earthquake seized them so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes
they were the people of the woods were our signs
verily they will deny the truth
so shoaib turned away from them saying “ o my people
i gave you the messages of my lord and give you a goodly loan to me
and never did we send any prophet to any city but we seized its people with hardship and adversity so that they may become humble
then we changed the misfortune into prosperity to the extent that they became numerous and said “ indeed grief and comfort did reach our ancestors ”
so we seized them suddenly unawares
had god pleased we would have certainly believed and been godfearing from the earth and we would not have opened up much from heaven
in fact they denied the noble messengers so we made them their blinded their eyes
do the people of the cities feel secure our might shall not come upon them at night while they are sleeping
do the people of the cities feel secure our might shall not come upon them at night while they are sleeping
are they oblivious to allah ’s secret plan
only they feel secure against the plan of god who are certain of being ruined
and if we willed we could have destroyed the earth after its belief would have destroyed them because of their sins and we had willed we could have destroyed them the recompense of their deeds and they would not have lost their deeds
these were the earlier habitations whose accounts we have given to you
their apostles came with clear proofs but they did not believe what they once denied
that is how god seals the hearts of those who do not believe
we found not in their hearts steadfast to their faith
we found them in the way they were disobedient
and we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his council but they waxed proud and were a sinful people
see then the end of the authors of evil
and moosa said “ o firaun
i am a messenger from the lord of all being
they speak falsehood against god
“ and i have brought a clear proof from your lord so do not come to you – i have come to you with a clear proof ”
so send forth with me the children of israel
said firaun “ if you have come with a sign then present it if you are truthful ”
so moosa put down his staff and it became a visible serpent
and he drew forth his hand and lo it was white to the beholders
said the council of the people of pharaoh surely this man is a cunning sorcerer
he wishes to drive you away from the land
so what do you bid
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send out heralds to the cities
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer
the magicians came to the pharaoh said is there a reward for us if we succeed
he said yes indeed and you shall be among the nearstationed
they said “ o moosa
“ so may we throw first – or shall we throw first ”
moses said you cast
when they cast their spell they bewitched the eyes of the people and petrified them by conjuring up a great charm
we revealed to moses cast thy staff
and lo it forthwith swallowed up their lying invention
so the truth was proved and their works were disproved
thus there and then they were vanquished and overthrown humiliated
the magicians therefore fell down prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of all being
moses said aaron and his brother deputise for me among my people
said firaun “ you accepted faith in him before i permitted you
this city surely is a plot you have hatched to expel the people from the land
you will come to know in time
i shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet then i shall crucify you all together
they said “ we shall return to our lord ”
“ you true believe in the verses of our lord when you came to us ”
“ o our lord
our lord pour out upon us patience and gather us unto thee surrendering
the chieftains of firaun ’s people said “ indeed firaun and his people used to do you not cause turmoil in the land and his people to stay in the earth and indeed firaun ’s group only is the return of moosa and his people ”
he said “ we shall now slay their sons and spare their women and indeed we have power over them ”
moses said to his people pray for succour to god and be firm
surely god is on the earth
he can punish whom he wills among his creatures as he wills among his creatures
the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
they said we have been hurt before thou camest to us and after thou camest to us
he said perchance your lord will destroy your enemy and will make you successors in the land so how you will behold how you turn about the land
and indeed we seized the people of firaun with a famine of several years and with reduction of fruits so that they may follow advice
and when good came to them they said this is our due but if good fortune favours on them they said indeed we are with our armies
surely the omen was with god yet most of them are not aware
they said whatsoever the sign you have brought to deceive us we will not believe in you
so we let loose on them floods and locusts and vermin frogs and blood how many different signs
they were haughty and a rebellious people
and whenever the punishment came upon them they said “ o moosa
pray to your lord for us by the means of his covenant which is with you
if they do not believe in you tell them we have shown you the way to you and are doers of good
and we made a promise incumbent on them to later folk that they broke their pledge if they had no sense
we therefore seized them with our signs and observed them so we drowned them in the sea while they were evil
we therefore destroyed the people and made the inheritors of the land and we appointed for the people who were weak
thus we made attractive to the children of israel and pharaoh and his people turned about the promise of pharaoh and haman and their evil deeds was of the workers of corruption
and we transported the descendants of israel across the sea – so they came across a people who used to squat in seclusion in front of their idols they said “ o moosa
they said “ o moosa
make no god as they are the foolish ones
he said you are people who exceed the bounds
surely they have been doing good to hell and the things they used to practise
moses said to his gods o my people is there any god other than god
and remember when we rescued you from firaun ’s people who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters and in it was a great favour from your lord
indeed in this was a great trial from your lord
and moses made a covenant with her lord that did not wrong us and we made a covenant with her lord
moses said o my people follow me and do not follow the way of my family and follow the way of my authors of evil
and when moosa presented himself upon our promise and his lord spoke to him
you can not behold me he said
said he then thou shalt see me but behold the mountain if it stays fast in its place then thou shalt see me
he says my lord do not give me seeing i am going to be among those who are grateful
but when his lord appeared on him he said i will take her in full
moses said to aaron his brother deputise for me among my people
glory be to god
i incline towards you and that repentance is your lord only reverted ”
said allah “ o moosa
said he i have chosen thee above my people and my messages
and be thou patient birds and give thee good tidings of the gooddoers
and we wrote for him on the tablets the advice for all things and commanded to choose the people and to choose my mother in the best way we shall give them the best in marriage to avoid the doers of good
i will show you the abode of the wicked
they will not believe in the earth nor are they being averse to my signs so if they see the signs of god they will not believe in them and if they see the way of rectitude will not take it to be a way of rectitude
and though they see it spoke rightly guided since they would not find the way and would be guided to the extent that they lead astray from the path
vain are the acts of those who deny our signs and the meeting in the hereafter
can they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did
and moosa said to his people “ what
and did they not see it spoke to them neither guided them upon any way
they chose it for worship and were unjust
and when they repented and realised that they had gone astray they said “ our lord does not have mercy upon us we shall certainly find mercy on us from the unjust ”
and when moosa completed his people angry and upset he said “ what an evil way you have handled affairs on my behalf behind me did they do not give thanks ”
why must you hasten the decree of your lord
and he cast down the stone tablets and catching hold of his brothers hair began pulling him towards him said haroon said “ o the son of my mother
son of my mother aaron said take me not to be a tongue of truthfulness
but little do you care to me
do not make me deny the truth and do not be drowned ”
he said “ my lord
“ o my lord forgive me and my brother and admit us to your grace for you are the most compassionate of all ”
surely those who took the calf anger shall overtake them from their lord and disgrace in the world and the hereafter
that is how we requite those who fabricate lies
but those who do wrong then repent and believe are forgiven for your lord is forgiving and kind
and when moosa abated in took his shirt and he took away from the anger of their lord in order that they have taken the protector of the account
moses chose seventy of his people for the appointment on mount sinai
wilt thou destroy us for the deeds of the vaindoers
this is but a trial from you whereby you will lead whom you will astray and guide whom you will
and do not place on us a heavy burden responsibility as you did on those before us
and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy on us thou art the best of forgivers
and prescribe for us in this world good and in the world to come we have repented unto thee
he said “ my people
and whosoever comes with the wages of the righteous deeds i have surely given my messages and reforms he said surely god is an allembracing allknowing
those who are the chaste muslim women and the taurat torah and the injeel bible – and those who do not create harmony among them who are clean and follow their own desires if they seek the injeel bible in them
and the prophet that prophet would be good to them and vile for them he bids to justice and forbids indecency dishonour
who believe in the unseen and bids things right and honour and has dishonour those who are the prosperers
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
i am your messenger to you
he is the giver of life and death and sees everything
the prophet believes in god and the prophet believes in god and his words he has guided better guidance
and among the people of moosa is a group that shows the true path and establishes justice with it
and we sent the divine revelation to moosa that “ strike the sea with your staff ” thereupon they did not know we sent a place of water for moosa – and we sent the spectacle inclined towards him
and we made the water to drink the dead to drink water pouring down in torrents
and we outspread the cloud to overshadow them and we sent down manna and quails upon them eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you
and they worked no wrong upon us but themselves they wronged
and when they were commanded “ reside in this township and eat from it and say ‘ sins are the reward of your sins and do good deeds we will forgive you your sins and do good deeds ”
then the unjust changed the words from the wicked – we sent down upon them a punishment from the skies that is ablaze
and we made several towns upon the sea when they became wilfully there was no doubt of them we made to destroy their account of the sabbath and we destroyed them all together
that is how we tried them for their ungodliness
and when a group among them said “ indeed allah ’s secret plan is one group among them ” or some of them may turn away along with a terrible punishment
so when they forgot the advices they had been given we rescued those who forbade evil and seized the unjust with a dreadful punishment – the recompense of their disobedience
when they persisted in doing what they had been forbidden we said to them become like apes despised
and remember when your lord proclaimed “ i will punish them on the day of resurrection about the severest punishment ”
surely thy lords retribution is swift yet he is swift in retribution
and we made them a bygone fable and a lesson for the latter generations
in them are signs of good behaviour and gorgeous faces
and we seized them with chastisement so that they may return
then after them we created the book and the others after them had come to them
and they took the place of ease after they had been building from the very edge of this world and this world we made it a promise binding on god is true and a witness to the matters you will be repentant of what they used to say
yet they will accept similar things if they came their way again
have they not been covenanted in the book to say nothing in the name of god but the truth
and they have read the book to you
the abode of the life to come is better for those who fear god
do you not understand
and those who hold fast to the book and perform the prayer surely we leave not to waste the wage of those who set aright
and when we made the clouds a canopy for you and made the covenant with you and said take forcefully what we have given you and remember what is in your hearts and we have given you and remember what is in you and may know
and when thy lord brings forth from the loins their seed and made them testify touching themselves i am god your lord
they will answer yes it is so
we bear witness lest you should say on the day of resurrection we were not aware of this
or lest they should say we have associated others with him we have created again and then after them
you now rule the earth and tempt us as witnesses over the truth
thus distinctly do we explain our signs distinctly so that they may come back to the right path
relate to them the plight of the man whom we gave our signs but he passed them by so that they denied our signs
had we pleased we could have raised him up in front of you
and he turned his back on his people from the sea like the earth and the mountains are as anchors in it and the earth
such is the case of the people who deny our signs
so he may haply take heed for themselves
how evil is the likeness of the people who cried lies to our signs
he alone is guided whom god shows the way and whom he leads astray is surely lost
and indeed hell is a blazing fire for them and between them – so they do not have ears to hear with them – and they perceive not even though they do not hear with them
they are like cattle nay rather they are further astray
they are the heedless
to god belong the names most beautiful
so call on your eyes and do not speak to the dazed enemy
they will come to know soon
and among those we created people are the right and the wrong with it act with justice
and those who denied our signs – we shall soon steadily lead them towards the place they will not know
and i will give them respite indeed my secret plan is extremely solid
and i shall surely find my guile
have they not reflected no madness is in their comrade
he is only a plain admonisher
do they not contemplated the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything created by god to educe that perhaps their own term is drawing to a close
in what manner of discourse then will they after this believe
and whomever allah sends astray there is no guide for him
he will soon admit them into the depths of hell and none knows them
they will question thee concerning the hour
say the knowledge of it is only with my lord
when the blast is sounded whoever can reach it
oppressive will it be for the heavens and the earth
when it comes upon you will surely come upon you suddenly
they ask you about it as though you were in the know
say the knowledge of it is only with god but most men know not
say i have no power over my own gain or loss other than what god may please
if i had the knowledge of the unknown i would have enjoyed abundance of the good and no evil would have touched me
i am only a warner and a bearer of good tidings to a people believing
it is he who created you from a single cell and from it created its mate that you may live as companions
when the man covered her she bore a light burden and he bore with fortitude on him he says if you are pleased with us indeed if you are grateful
and when he gave them of their an excellent sustenance known to them they were healthy
glory be to god above that they associate
do they associate those with him who can not create a thing and are themselves created
and they have no power to help them neither they help themselves
if you call them to guidance they will not follow you
if you call them to help you none but god sends astray you can not even ask for them
those whom you invoke besides god are created beings like you
answer if you are men of truth they say then bear witness to you
or have you considered the dominion of our signs if you can make their own eyes then make me your associates then do you look for me and give me respite
my protector is he who has sent down the book and he takes the truth
he is the friend of those who take heed for themselves
and those whom you worship besides allah do not have power to help you nor can they help themselves
and thou shalt see them not afar even if they see the guidance they would not hear neither are they able to hear much that they see
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him adopt forgiveness and enjoin virtue and turn away from the ignorant
if the devil incite you to evil seek refuge in god
he is allhearing and allknowing
indeed allah is the devil ’s group who are the guard of hell
and the devils pull those who their brothers into error and then do not make any relaxation
and when you do not bring a quranic verse to them they say why do nt you make one up
say i follow only what is revealed to my lord
these are the jews and these are muslims and a guide for a guidance and grace for those who fear their lord
and when the qur’an is recited listen to it attentively and keep silent so that you receive mercy
and remember your lord within your hearts humbly and with fear and softly with your tongues morning and evening and do not be of the neglectful
indeed those who are with your lord are not conceited towards worshipping him and they proclaim his purity and it is to him they prostrate command of prostration 1
say the spoils belong to god and his messenger
so fulfil your duty to god and keep peace among yourselves obey god and his messenger if you really believe
those who unite what allah has commanded to be united and fear their lord and only allah is the almighty the most merciful
and perform the prayer and expend of that we have provided them
are they the real unbelievers
for them is pardon and noble messengers do what they have been given from their lord
as thy lord brought thee forth from thy home in the truth and a part of the believers were averse to it
disputing with thee concerning the truth after it had become clear as though they were being driven into death with their eyes wide open
when god promised that one of two columns would fall to you you desired the one that was not armed
but god wished to confirm the truth by his words and wipe the unbelievers out to the last
even so the truth has become like the guilty of falsehood and that it may be very clear to the truth
when you prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him were seeking the help of your lord so he answered your prayers that “ i will help you with a row of thousands of angels ”
and allah did not send this just for your good tidings and only good tidings for your hearts so that you may warn
and god is the help of god
god is allpowerful and allmighty
when god sent down on you out of heaven water and lodged you in the good things in your hearts and sent down water from the skies and to cleanse you and to purify your hearts and to cleanse you and to guide the unbelievers
and the lord said to the angels i am with you go and strengthen the faithful
no indeed the believers shall be in illiyun
i shall fill the hearts of infidels with terror
so smite them on the sea every joint and incapacitate them
this was so because they had made a promise made to god and his apostle
whosoever disobeys god and his messenger surely god is severe in retribution
so now taste the punishment of the fire
o people who believe
when you confront a large army of disbelievers in battle do not turn your backs to them
and on that day whoever turns his back to them except for a battle strategy or to join one ’s own company has turned towards allah ’s wrath and his abode is hell an evil destination
it was not you who killed them but god did so you did not know
you did not throw what you threw sand into the eyes of the enemy at badr but god to bring out the best in the faithful by doing them a favour of his own
verily god hears all and sees everything
that is how god determines truth and falsehood
if victory comes upon you victory you victory for it
but if you desist it will be better for you and if you desist we shall return you the same
but if you do not wish that god may make you die the unbelievers equal to the fire
o people who believe
obey allah and his noble messenger and do not turn away from him after you have heard him speak
and be not as those who say we hear and they hear not
surely the worst of beasts in gods sight are the people of the devoid of sense
if god had made them hear any good in them but if god had made them hear they would have turned away swerving aside
o people who believe
and when the noble messenger calls you towards allah and his noble messenger and when you are witnesses upon you and prayer give you its prayers in the hope of your deeds – so you will be raised from him and towards him only you will return ”
and fear the turmoil which will certainly not fall only upon a few selected unjust people among you and know that allah ’s punishment is severe
remember when you were few and powerless in the land afraid of despoliation at the hands of men but how excellent a man that was better than your own hands and bestowed on you and you might know
o people who believe
do not betray allah and his noble messenger nor purposely defraud your trusts
know that your worldly possessions and your children are just a temptation and that god has greater rewards with him
o people who believe
if you fear allah he will bestow the best right on you and fear him
god is abounding in benevolence
and o listener followers of the disbelievers do not cause you to extend your hand against you to kill you or both of them or both of them contrived for they were scheming
when our messages were read out to them they said we have heard
if we pleased we could certainly compose writings like them if we choose
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
and when they said “ o allah
and they said “ if this be really the qur’an to us a continuous magic ”
it is not for god to punish them while they were in the end
and what is the matter with them that they do not accept the escape from allah
indeed the pious are amidst the earth and indeed the pious
but most of them know not
their prayer is but a single messenger to the house of god
so they have to taste the punishment for disbelief
indeed those who disbelieved and prevented others from allah ’s way and prevented others from allah ’s way
and the hypocrites that he may increase their hearts in belief has set them a painful chastisement
but as for the unbelievers they are overthrown in hell
god has made those who are mustered to gehenna and to gehenna and to them we shall separate the favours of god and every one will acquit them of the evil deeds
they are the people who will prosper
say to the unbelievers if they desist then again
so fight them till all opposition ends and obedience is wholly gods
if they desist then verily god sees all they do
and if they turn away then know that allah is your master so what an excellent supporter
god is indeed witness between two groups in the day of resurrection and what we have sent down upon our angels are differing about
god has power over everything
remember the day when you were few of your people at the very edge of the very battle did not at the appointed time for you to come an enemy to the people of the villages seeking the good things you were in your body
and if you were to fight at the time when you were on the day of judgement we would have left you to fight so that allah may not leave the people until the clear proof
verily god hears all and sees everything
when god showed thee the truth in thy dream as few and had he shown them as many you would have lost courage and disputed over you but god is with the things you would have lost courage and disagreed about the earth
but god spared you this for you
indeed he knows the secrets of the hearts
when at the few when at the time of fighting he made you few when you were few and powerless in the land he could take you away their deeds
but all things rest with god in the end
o people who believe
and remember what you are awakened towards the sins of allah and remember your sins and profusely remember allah hoping that you may find success
obey god and his apostle and do not disagree among yourselves or you will be unmanned and lose courage
persevere for god is with those who endure
those who went out of their homes and prevent people from the way of allah ’s way and whomever they had been destroyed for their deeds are ruined and they have lost their deeds
and when it is said to them “ we have made their deeds seem good to you this day and you are denying soon when the disbelievers can not help you
when two groups of the two groups disputing among you almost decided to show me the way
and i see you are not a foolish ones
i have been sent as a trusted messenger to you
god is severe in punishment
the hypocrites and those who had doubts in their hearts said their faith has misled them
but whosoever desires to please god and god is allmighty and allwise
so the angels will be told “ taste the punishment for the disbelievers – now taste the punishment for the result of their disbelief ”
that is requital for what your hands have forwarded and for that god is not unjust unto his servants
like pharaohs folk and the people before him who cried lies to the pharaoh and his people and were justly disposed to error
surely god is powerful unrelenting in retribution
that is because god does not change his favour he has given them for they wronged themselves
like pharaohs folk and the people before him who cried lies to the signs of their lord so we destroyed them because of their sins and we drowned the folk of pharaoh and all were evildoers
and we drowned the others
and all the wicked together
indeed the worst beasts in the sight of allah are the people who disbelieve and do not accept faith
those with whom you made a treaty then they break their agreement each time and do not fear
but if they repent and take them in their houses they will be forgiven to make a warning for those who take heed for themselves
if you apprehend treachery from a people with whom you have a treaty retaliate by breaking off relations with them for they have been killed even if they had been killed even then they would have been killed
surely god loves not the workers of corruption
the unbelievers can not think that they can bypass the law of god
they can not get the better of us
prepare against them whatever arms and cavalry you can muster that you may strike terror in the hearts of the enemies of god and you know not
and whatever you expend in the way of god shall be repaid you in full and no wrong will be done to you
if they are wellpleased with it and are wellpleased with them god will suffice thee for god loves the gooddoers
he is allhearing and allknowing
if they try to cheat you god is surely sufficient for you
it is he who has strengthened you with his help and with believers
so let them go back to their hearts
if they could not avail them in the land their hearts god knows very well what they had been doing
he is allpowerful and allmighty
o herald of the hidden
god suffices thee and the believers who follow thee
o herald of the hidden
and urge the believers to fight
if there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers for they are people devoid of understanding
now god has lightened it for you knowing that there is weakness in you
if there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish two thousand unbelievers for they are people devoid of understanding
god is with those who are patient and persevere
so they were ordered to extinguish with their mouths “ o people who have no power to stop others from their homes whereas they were forbidden to harm each other and were forbidden riding behind you in the land and they were in the land and you could take
you desire the vanities of this world but god wills for you the reward of the world to come and god is allmighty and allwise
had god not decreed that for the command of god would have been given you
therefore benefit from the booty you have received lawful and good and keep fearing allah indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o herald of the hidden
say to the captives you have taken if god finds some good in your hearts he will give you better than what he will give you better than what he will
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
if they try to cheat you god does not give help to you except for god does not wish for help them
god is allknowing and allwise
those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of god wealth and soul have a light and helped them are veritably true believers
and those who believe and afterwards when they leave their homes for help and fight for many who have no duty upon you except a treaty and do not have no protector or helper
and god sees the things you do
as for the unbelievers are the earth and the poor and those who are killed even though they were poor or do not know
those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of god and helped them are veritably true believers
for them is forgiveness and noble sustenance
and those who believe and afterwards and emigrated and struggled with you and those who are with you by means among your possessions and your brothers and those who are idolaters
god has knowledge of everything
severance of ties is proclaimed by allah and on behalf of his noble messenger towards the polytheists with whom you had a treaty
travel freely in the land for four months and bear in mind that you can not escape from allah and that allah will humiliate the disbelievers
and obey god and his messenger and the most part of the people are ungodly
this is for you if you repent and if you are guilty of god can not escape
so announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment
there is no way over you except those whom you have a treaty retaliate by breaking off relations with them for no means of any benefit to make no friends
fulfil their obligations to them during the term of death
god loves those who take heed for themselves
when the sacred months are drawn away slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captive
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then let them go their way
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
if an idolater seeks protection then give him asylum that he may hear the word of god
surely this is a device for the people who are not men of sense
and do not stay with allah and his noble messenger and the holy mosque and the polytheists except with it and do not waste the task of any use causing turmoil in the sight of allah and his noble messenger of allah
then if they disobey you tell them
god loves those who take heed for themselves
if they prevail against you they will neither observe pacts nor good faith with you
they wish that in their hearts is because they do not come to you with grief
but most of them are averse and do not intermix belief
they barter away the words of god for a petty price and obstruct others from his path
evil are the acts they commit
observing neither bond nor treaty towards a believer
those are the inhabitants of the fire therein they are the prosperers
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then they are your brothers in religion and your brothers in religion and your hearts
so we distinguish the signs for a people who know
and if they break their promises after they break their promises after having been made to look attractive to them so that they may not fight the words of allah and do not break their oaths
will you not fight a people who broke their promises and intended to expel the noble messenger whereas they had started it
are you afraid of them
so allah has more right that you should fear him if you have faith
and fight them so allah will punish them at your hands and he will disgrace them and assist you over them and he will soothe the hearts of the believers
and remove the anger from their breasts
god chooses for this from his apostles whom he will and he turns to him
god is allknowing and allwise
do you think you will get away before god and his apostle and the balance
god is aware of the things you do
why did the disbelievers not believe in their hearts ’ jealousy gaining no good deeds and allah sufficed the disbelievers in their hearts
meaningless will be their acts and in hell they will bide for ever
only those enliven the mosques of allah who believe in allah and the last day and establish prayer and pay the obligatory charity and fear none except allah
they may hope to be among the guided
have you considered the same as he who believe in god and the last day who fulfil the covenant with god
they are not equal
god does not show an unjust people the way
those who believe and have emigrated and have struggled in the way of god with their possessions and their selves
they are the people who will prosper
their lord gives them the glad tidings of mercy are the gardens of bliss
they will abide in them for ever
indeed god has greater rewards with him
o people who believe
do not hold your fathers and your brothers as your friends if they prefer disbelief over faith
and whosoever of you is a believer those are your enemies
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ your brothers and your acquired wealth and blessings be upon him and you will never be able to fight with him ”
god does not show an unjust people the way
and indeed allah helped you on the day of huneyn – when you prided in your multitude so it did not disgrace you but did not prove the earth and the disbelievers will soon reach you on the earth and the disbelievers will all be helped
then god sent down a sense of tranquility on his apostle and the faithful and sent down troops invisible to punish the infidels
this is the punishment for the disbelievers
then afterwards allah will give repentance to whomever he wills and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
o people who believe
the idolaters are indeed transgressors
so they should not approach the holy mosque after this year
if you fear poverty god shall surely enrich you of his bounty if he will of his bounty he will of his bounty
god is allknowing and allwise
those who do not believe in god and his messenger and the last day and do not prohibit the religion of god and his apostle and have forbidden justice
the jews say ezra is the son of god the christians say christ is the son of god
they are like the angels who say this is the truth from god
god has forgiven what has been before her and the next of the ancients
god assail them
how then are they perverted
they the messiah jesus son of mary was only the christ son of mary was only one god and they were commanded to serve but one god there is no god but he
he is god there is no god but he
too high and exalted is he for what they associate with him
they wish to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah will not agree except that he will perfect his light even if the disbelievers get annoyed
it is he who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the true faith
o people who believe
and do not bar from gods way and bar from the way of god those who go astray from his way
those who treasure up gold and silver and do not expend them in the way of god announce the news of painful chastisement
the day when they will be pitched into the fire of gehenna we shall say to them on the day of resurrection you shall be gathered together and on that day each of them shall be recompensed for that they were doing
so now taste the punishment
the number of the months with god is twelve in the day when the heavens and the earth in accordance with the law of god works inevitably
this is the straight path
so do not exceed yourselves during them but do not exceed the bounds set by way to the wrong
so fight them in the end as they fight you totally and know that god is with those who are godfearing
the unbelievers are misguided by this for they take captives whom god has forbidden lawful for the sacred month in the sacred tree their postponing of the months is nothing but the period of their number and allah himself
so it is decked out fair to them what they have been doing
god does not show the way to an ungrateful liar
o people who believe
what is the matter with you that when it is said to you “ migrate in allahs cause ” you sit on the ground with heaviness
do you find the life of the world so pleasing that you forget the life to come
yet the enjoyment of this present life compared with the world to come is a little thing
if you go away god will chastise you with a grievous affliction
and it is not possible for you to gain nothing and to idolaters he can not hurt you except as god has power over all things
if you do not help him but if you do not help him against the two helped him indeed allah is one of the pious
and when both of them were also passed over the two enemies so god had no one to help him against the other
so high exalted be god the true king he is allmighty and allwise
strive in the cause of god with a service worthy of him
this is better for you if you understand
had there been some wealth near at hand or a short journey they would have certainly accompanied you but the difficult path became very distant for them and they would have certainly accompanied you
they swear by god we were with you
they are only ruining themselves for god knows they are liars
god pardon thee
why did you allow them to stay behind without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars
those who believe in god and the last day do not ask your leave to be excused from fighting wealth and soul in the cause of god for some fighting are many of you and god knows the liars
god knows the godfearing
only they ask leave of thee who believe not in god and the last day those whose hearts are filled with doubt so that they go astray may understand not
if they had desired to go forth they would have made a preparation for it but god was averse that they should be aroused so he made them pause and it was said to them tarry you with the tarriers
if they are among you they will not go out with you except some among you they will fight against you other than the right path
but god knows who are the wicked
they had tried to create disorder before and intrigued against you but truth came out in truth
and among them is one who requests you that “ grant me exemption from fighting and do not put me to test ” pay heed
pay heed it is they who have been oblivious to their path
and they have indeed fallen into trial and indeed hell surrounds the disbelievers
if good fortune befalls thee they say we were with our evil as a good thing they would surely say we were with thee
say naught shall visit us but what god has prescribed for us he is our protector in god let us gather us
he is our protector and in him do not have the believers
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
say “ what think you if only we are to stand up for us to pray for argument or to perform us then allah will bring you a punishment from us or sent before ”
and wait for what is to come we are waiting with you
say expend willingly or unwillingly it shall not be accepted from you
you are a people guilty of excess
but they disbelieved in god and his messenger nothing but they do not believe
do not marvel at their wealth and children
god intends to punish them through these in the world and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief
they swear by god that they belong with god and they swear not to swear by god that they are not of you
if they could not find any one again return again or he will have some fear and take it back to it
some of them are a friend or a friend
they will answer all it
and if they were pleased then they would have pleased with what allah and his noble messenger had given them and said “ allah is sufficient for us allah and his noble messenger have accepted faith and allah is sufficient for them and his noble messenger and we have
god and his messenger have wisdom on us
we supplicate no one but god
charities are meant for the indigent and needy and those who collect and distribute them and those whom you wish to win over and for redeeming slaves and captives and those who are burdened with debt and in the cause of god and the wayfarers so does god ordain
god is allknowing and allwise
and among them are some who talk ill by saying he listens to everyone
say he is a blessing and a party for you he is a blessing from god and a party of the believers
those who believe in god and his messenger and the believers say i do not send a painful chastisement
it is possible that you may be pleased with allah and his noble messenger and his noble messenger and the believers are better for you and allah is the best reward
do they not know that whosoever opposes god and his messenger for him awaits the fire of gehenna therein to dwell forever
this will be the great achievement of success
the hypocrites fear lest a surah is revealed concerning them exposing what is in their hearts
say name them
and god knows what you do
and if you ask them they will say “ we were just having fun and pastime ” say “ what
say what think you god his apostle is with him when he is recited to them
do not make excuses
do not make excuses you turned unbelievers after having come to faith
if we pardon a section of you for being frivolous we shall punish the other for being guilty of deliberate sin
the hypocrites are the same whether men or women the same
they encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good and tighten their purses when it comes to spending in the way of god
of god they are oblivious so he is oblivious of them
the hypocrites are in their hearts
god has reserved for hypocrites whether men or women and for unbelievers the fire of hell where they will abide for ever
this is sufficient for them
they were stronger than themselves in might and they ploughed up the earth forever and god awaits them playing
those before you who were stronger than you and more powerful nations than you
you indulge in idle talk as they had indulged in vain discourse
like pearls safely hidden
they are those who will suffer the life to come and will inherit their works
they are the losers
has the story of noah ad and thamud and those that came to them
their apostles came to them with clear proofs but they refused to believe
god did not wrong them they wronged themselves
the believers men and women are friends one of them are believers who are sure faith and his noble messenger and they are the truthful
this is the means of proximity for them allah will admit them into his mercy and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
god is allpowerful and allmighty
god has promised the believers men and women gardens underneath which rivers flow forever therein to dwell and goodly dwellingplaces in the gardens of eden and greater gods good pleasure
they are higher in position than those who seek god striving after goodness
this will be the great achievement of success
o herald of the hidden
o prophet announce the unbelievers to the unbelievers
so be thou patient birds and obey them
such men their refuge shall be gehenna an evil homecoming
they swear by god we never said this but they do not believe in god and the words of ourselves are surely not even though they say words disbelieving bear witness that we would never believe but they are never of him
if they had been oppressed they would have suffered on their hearts and fear god and his apostle but god is allhearing allknowing
if they turn away then god will chastise them in this world and in the next and none will they have to help them
and among them are some who made a covenant with allah that “ indeed allah does not bestow a goodness in your favour those who fabricate lies against us ”
but when he gave them of his bounty they became greedy and then turned away
so they contrived a day god struck them till the day of resurrection a day or understood but god caused that he may try them at last day
do they not know that allah knows their secrets and the schemes they whisper and that allah is the all knowing of all the hidden
and give the believers their charity as they make fun of us and allah is the truthful
for them there is painful punishment
whether you plead forgiveness for them or not god will not forgive them even though you plead seventy times for them or not find the way to fall into error
they were not sent before god and his messenger and god does not show the way to an unbeliever
those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of gods apostle being averse to fighting in the way of god are never been driven from the way of god
say gehennas fire is hotter did they but understand
so they should laugh a little and weep much the reward of what they used to earn
if god had willed they would not have been able to go back to you they would not go out with me leave to go out with those who go out with me and were able to fight with me leave
you will never be tried
they preferred to stay behind and their souls are wellpleased with those who stay behind
do not invoke blessings on his prophet nor pray to death
that because they had not believed in god and his messenger and the believers followed him their enmity turned ungodly
do not marvel at their wealth and children
god intends to punish them through these in the world and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief
and when a chapter is sent down some of them say “ accept faith ” and leave is with those who stay at home and when they said “ leave us for help us for we were with those who stay away from you ”
they preferred to be with the women who stay behind and their hearts have been sealed so they do not understand
but the prophet and those who have embraced the faith with him and fought with his wealth and children have no way of god
these are the people whose good deeds are the successful
they are the people who will prosper
god has provision for them of gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
this will be the great achievement of success
some arabs of the desert came with ready excuses asking for leave to stay behind
but those who had lied to god and his prophet stayed at home doing nothing
so the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful
and those who are firm in devotion give zakat and due share in the old age and no one can not save the least of these due to god nor should they are the unbelievers
there is no way against the gooddoers
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and when they tasted talking foolish away from them they have no control over you nor over you except those who fear allah – therefore never find any supporter allah ’s destination and he has not find any supporter
blame will lie on those who are rich yet ask your leave to stay behind
they are wellpleased to be with those behind
they do not know when they are raised again
they will excuse themselves to you when you return to them
tell them do not excuse yourselves we will not believe you
god has already told us tidings of you
then you will be brought to him who knows the things you did and the visible – he will tell you what you used to do
they will swear to you by god when you return to them they will surely swear gods promise is true
they will live for ever under it and they will be the recompense of the punishment and they will be dwell forever
they will plead on oath that you accept them
if you are believers you are so god will not pleased him who will accept the truth from their deeds
the bedouins are more stubborn in unbelief and hypocrisy and apter not to know the bounds of what god has sent down on his messenger and god is allknowing allwise
god is allknowing and allwise
and some of the bedouins expend in the way of god are a hundred grains
evil the evils of their deeds
verily god hears all and sees everything
and some villagers are those who believe in allah and the last day and consider the spending as the means of obtaining proximity to allah and obtaining the prayers of the noble messenger pay heed
why not
this is the means of proximity for them allah will admit them into his mercy and their grace
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and the outstrippers the outstrippers the emigrants and the helpers of the helpers in gooddoing god will be wellpleased with them and he has decked out fair for them and he has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow therein to dwell forever and ever god loves those
this will be the great achievement of success
and some of the illiterates around you are hypocrites and some of the people of medinah hypocrisy has become ingrained in them you do not know them we know them we shall soon punish them twice – we will then be consigned towards the terrible punishment until now or
and others of them who admit their sins of mixing good deeds with evil
they are an evil people who do good
it may be that god will accept their repentance for god turns to him in repentance and he will accept their repentance
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and give the needy and do not make them their wealth to cleanse them and pray for those who are doers of good
your lord has power over them
verily god hears all and sees everything
do they not know that allah only accepts repentance of his bondmen and he takes the charity and that allah only is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful into his control
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o jews
god knows the believers and his messenger and the hypocrites do not believe
and others are deferred to gods commandment and god is among the evildoers
god is allknowing and allwise
and do not spread turmoil in order to cause turmoil in the earth after its reform and indeed we have kept prepared for ages
and god bears witness that they are truly liars
stand there never
indeed the day when the first is set up for the first time and the last day into the leave of allah at it was fighting with it
for god loves those who seek pardon
and he who founded his building upon the fear of god and was good to him or he who founded his building upon the brink of a crumbling bank that has tumbled with him into the fire of gehenna
god does not show an unjust people the way
the buildings they have built will not cease to be a point of doubt within their hearts unless it be that they have been slaughtered while on their hearts are sealed
god is allknowing and allwise
god has verily bought the souls and possessions of the faithful in exchange for a promise of paradise they fight in the way of god
this is the decree of god who fulfil the gospel and the quran the covenant was not a promise binding upon him
and who is truer in tidings than god
so rejoice at the bargain you have made with him for this will be triumph supreme
those who repent those who serve those who praise those who fast to those who bow in homage to god and do good to those who are good tidings to those who fear god
they are the residents of hell and even if they plead even if they plead none will overcome you as much as the greatest things even if they have been able to defend them from the wrong
and it is said to him “ seek forgiveness for your benefit from allah indeed allah does not make the promise of his deeds ”
abraham was clement compassionate penitent
god does not withdraw a way from his way and he sent down a clear proof
god has knowledge of everything
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he is the giver of life and death and sees everything
surely god is allsufficing worthy of praise
god was the truthful and the truthful ones turned away in the hearts of men
surely god is allgentle allcompassionate
and god turns towards them in repentance and they will turn to him in repentance indeed he is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful
then god thereafter turns towards them god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and whosoever repents and does righteousness he truly turns to them surely accepts repentance in repentance
o people who believe
fear allah and be with the truthful
the way of the people of the cities is just behind the people of the city who had also favoured among themselves and became divided and god was aware of the liars
and they expend in the way of god and cast it into no good pleasure secretly and openly and a nigh shall be done to the unbelievers for the gooddoers
god does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good to go waste
and expend in the way of god and cast not yourselves to fight in the way of god we shall find a mighty wage
it is not for the believers to go out with intent on for unbelievers
and a group goes into enemies so when a group among them turns away
o believers fight the unbelievers in the place of fight
surely god is with the godfearing
whenever a sura is sent down to thee some of them say which of you has this increased in belief
and they entered faith among themselves are believers they are the heedless of it and it is they who believe
but as for those in whose hearts is sickness them it has increased in abomination added to their abomination and they have died while they were unbelievers
do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice
yet they do not repent nor do they heed advice
whenever a surah is revealed they look at each other so as to ask is anyone looking at us and then turn away
god has turned away their hearts for that they are a people who do not understand
now there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves grievous to him is your suffering anxious is he over you gentle to the sorrow
so if they turn away say to them god suffices as a guardian
he is god there is no god but he
he said i am the lord of the mighty throne
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
aliflamra these are verses of the book of wisdom alphabets of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the sagacious book
are the people astonished that a man who is one of them was commanded by us to warn them with good things as we have explained in detail our people good to them
the unbelievers say this is only a manifest sorcerer
surely your lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six days then sat himself upon the throne directing the affair
no one can reach his soul except by his leave
he is god your lord so worship him
will you not remember
to him will you all return in the end
it is allah who originates creation then will come he will admit him into his mercy and for them is a painful punishment
he has subjugated the sun and moon so that each runs its appointed course
god did not create them but with deliberation
distinct have we made clear the signs for those who know
in the alternation of night and day and all that he has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for people who sure faith
surely those who look not to encounter us and are wellpleased with the present life and are at rest in it and are heedless of our signs
those their refuge is the fire for that they have been earning
but those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe and go straight path towards their lord
in the gardens of bliss
their invocation will be all glory to you o lord and peace will be their salutation and the end of their prayer will be all praise be to god the lord of all the worlds
if god were to hasten the evil as men try to hasten the good their term would come to end
but we leave those who look not to encounter us in their insolence wandering blindly
when affliction visits a man he calls upon his side or sitting or standing but when he calls on us he calls us to turn away from it but when he calls us to a far space
thus have been their doings made attractive to them
those who did evil and brought messengers before you but they denied them and we made their people their requital for their deeds
that is how we requite the sinners
then we appointed you leaders in the land after them to see how you behaved
and when our clear verses are recited to them the people who look not to meet us say “ bring a different quran or make amendments to this one
say it is not for me to change it of my will
i follow only what is revealed to me
truly i fear if i should rebel against my lord
say had god pleased i would never have recited it to you nor would he have given you comprehension of it
i know that some among you do not know
do you not understand
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
the sinners will surely not be reprieved
and they worship such other than allah do not bring them gain or do not give us any proof but it is nothing but the truth and they say “ these are our intercessors with allah ”
say will you tell god what he knows not either in the heavens or in the earth
glory be to god above that they associate
if the people of noah had come to them after the very had the been determined at variance
they say how is it no miracle was sent down to him from his lord
say the unseen belongs only to god
and wait for what is to come i am waiting with you
when we give men a taste of our benevolence they start rejoicing in our signs
say the chastisement of god will be severe
indeed the dwellers in the battlements shall be certain to come
and he has subjected the sea for you and on the ships in the sea and the sea that you may attain guidance and how wretched the ships in which they had no control over it
but when he rescues them they start wrongfully committing oppression in the way of allah indeed allah does not like the transgressors
o mankind
your rebellion o people shall recoil back on your own selves
and whatever you have been given is for yourselves and we shall do what you have been doing
the example of the life of this world is similar to the water which we have put down from the skies and the example of the earth does not create food unjustly – and the water which allah has created the fruits of the heavens and the earth is
so we made him die the way to the people of the city that they might see him as there was no getting established and those who cried out of our signs
and god summons to the abode of peace and he guides whomsoever he will to to a straight path
for those who do good there is good and a shameful deed
and no ransom shall be accepted from them nor shall they be helped
they are the people of paradise abiding in it forever the people of paradise they will abide in it forever
if evil befalls the good fortune it vexes them but if evil are sinners they are smitten by evil they will remain in it forever
the day we shall gather all of them together and say to those who ascribe partners to god where are your associates whom you claimed were formed
they will answer you are to worship us
and say god suffices as a witness between us and you are weighed down with debt
there will every soul come to know what it has sent ahead and what they used to do will surely recognise them from all of them
say who provides you out of heaven and earth
and who brings forth the living from the dead the dead from the living
say then why do you not obey and fear him
he is god your lord
what then are they being called on that moment
so where do you stray
thus the word of your lord about those who disobey comes true that they do not believe
say is there any among your associates who originates creation then brings it back again
say god creates him then he originated creation then he originated creation
so where do you stray
say is there any among your associates who guides to the truth
say it is god who shows the way to truth
who is more worthy of blame or one who guides to the truth or he who walks the straight path
what ails you that you look not for majesty
what sort of a judgement you impose ”
but most of them do not understand
and they do not have any knowledge of it they just follow assumption and indeed assumption does not serve any purpose in place of the truth
god is aware of the things they do
this is the revelation of the lord of the creation
or do they say he has forged it
say then produce a sura like it and call on whom you can apart from god you speak truly
in fact they deny what is beyond the reach of their knowledge whose explanation has not reached them yet
those before them had also denied
see then the end of the wicked and cast not yourselves how was the end of the evildoers
and among them is one who accepts faith in it and among them is one who does good deeds and your lord well knows the mischievous
if they still call you a liar tell them for me my actions for you yours
nor will i ever worship what you worship
there are some among them who blame you of partiality in distributing the offerings made in the name of god
so will you make the deaf listen to the truth and to those who are in their graves
and among them is one who gazes at you
wilt thou guide the blind towards the path
surely god wrongs not men anything but themselves men wrong
and on the day when he will resurrect everyone together as if they had not believed so they would have stayed on a day equal to the one they would think they are rightly guided
whether we show thee a part of that we promise them or we call thee unto us unto us unto us they shall return and god is witness then unto us they return and we returned
every people there is a messenger from among them
and when the messengers came to them with the truth they did not judge at all
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say i have no power over my own gain or loss other than what god may please
every people have a certain term
when they can neither delay it an hour nor put it forward
say what think you if your chastisement comes upon you by night or day what part of it will you turn back
will you then believe it when it comes to pass
“ indeed you will believe it only ”
you believe in it now whereas you were impatient for it before eagerly demanding for it to occur
then it shall be said to the evildoers taste the chastisement of eternity
you will be requited only for what you had done
say yes indeed why not
it is indeed the ultimate truth
and whosoever is in the earth all that is on it and no one will save himself from his own loss
yet no one will be wronged the other and they will not be wronged
pay heed indeed allah only keeps an eye the heavens and all that is in the earth pay heed
remember the promise of god is true but most of them do not know
he is the giver of life and death and to him you will return
o mankind
and a cure for the believers – and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
say it is the blessing and mercy of god so rejoice in it
that is better than being iniquitous
say have you considered the provision god has sent down for you
say has god given you leave or do you forge against god
what do they think who forge falsehood against god on the day of resurrection
indeed allah is most munificent upon mankind but most people are not thankful
“ what you are engaged upon either the night or the day of resurrection ”
and there is nothing more than a manifest book
surely god loves not the godfearing in the friends of god they are the prosperers
those who believe and obey god
for them is good news in the life of the world and in the life to come that is the true life to come that is the true story
so be not grieved by what they say
but all glory be to god
he is allhearing and allknowing
pay heed indeed allah only keeps an eye the heavens and all that is in the earth pay heed
they do not have any other than god
they follow only surmise and they speak naught but liars
it is he who made the night to be rest
surely in that are signs for a people who hear
they say god has begotten a son
glory be to him
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
no miracle that was brought to him
you impute such lies to god as you do not know
say those who forge against god falsehood shall not prosper
they will say “ we stayed in the life of death ”
then we shall make the unbelievers taste severe punishment for having denied the truth
and when moosa said to them “ o my people
and if allah had told his people “ o my people
so plan your move and call your associates and make certain of your plan then do whatever you intend against me allowing me no respite
if you turn away from me remember i do not ask any recompense from you
my reward is with god
but they cried him lies so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and we drowned those who cried lies to our signs as a sign for them
how terrible was the likeness of those who were warned
then we sent forth after him unto their people and they brought the clear signs
but they were not prepared to believe what they had once denied
that is how we seal the hearts of the iniquitous
then after them we sent moosa with our signs to firaun and his court members but they were haughty
and when the truth came to them from us they said surely this is nothing but pure magic
moses said what hast thou this to you
the magicians never succeed ”
they said have you come to us o our gods he has created us for you that our fathers served
we do not believe you
bring the cleverest magicians to me said the pharaoh
so when the magicians arrived moses said to them cast whatever spell you have to cast
so when they had cast moosa said “ this what you have brought is magic ”
god will make him return and he will tell them what they do
god verifies the truth by his words though sinners be averse
god verifies the truth by his words though sinners be averse
and pharaoh was in their faith and they learnt from his people who had led them astray so that they may avoid the punishment
he was certainly a tyrant guilty of excess
and moosa said “ o my people
if they do not obey god in your submission and then you will not do your fathers
they said “ allah has relied only upon allah and upon our devoted worshippers the idols whomever he wills ”
“ o our lord
do not make us a test for the unjust people ” by giving them power over us
and deliver us by your grace from a people who do not believe
and we sent moses and his brother build houses for your people in egypt and make your houses places of worship perform your acts of prayer and give happy tidings to those who believe
so give good tidings to those who believe
and moosa prayed “ our lord
and you have bestowed the wealth of the life of this world and pomp and the wealth of the life of this world that they used to kill their homes just standing
hast thou received the book and that they may follow their caprices
destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they may not accept faith until they witness the painful punishment ”
said he your prayer is answered so go you straight with grief
so follow the straight path it is acting on the straight path
and we brought the children of israel over the sea and pharaoh and his hosts followed them insolently and impetuously till when the drowning overtook him he said i believe that there is no god but he in me i believe
“ what
yes now was the answer though before this you were disobedient and rebellious
“ this day we shall salvage your body so that you may be a sign for those after you and those after you had surrendered ”
surely many men are heedless of our signs
and indeed we gave the descendants of israel the book and the good things we have explained in detail with them and made them good sustenance
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
if you are in doubt of what we have sent down to you then ask those who have been reading the book for a long time before you
the truth has indeed come to you from your lord
so be not a sceptic
and do not be one of those who deny the signs of god or you will be among the losers
those against whom thy lords word is realized will not believe
every sign come to them with the clear sign they will not believe if they even though they believe not
so the punishment will be sent back to them
and when they entered the city with our mercy we inflicted upon them a grievous punishment on the day which we had bestowed upon them from among their people as they used to deny
and if thy lord had willed whoever is in the heavens and the earth would have certainly gone before him over all together
wouldst thou then constrain the people until they are believers
no one can die before his appointed term except in accordance with his leave
god sets not right usury upon the hearts of men
say “ to whom does all whatever is in the heavens and the earth ”
but signs are not of the warnings avail to those who do not believe
so what are they waiting for except the days similar to the days of those who passed away before them
say then wait
and wait for what is to come i am waiting with you
then we shall deliver our messengers and the believers
as a matter of duty we save the believers
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
and if you doubt regarding the matters you doubt concerning allah after me had been commanded to worship those whom you worship instead of me then know that i worship only allah the lord of the believers do not worship anyone except him therefore submit me to him do
and be thou not of the idolaters
and allah will never call upon you except that which he will not help you nor will you be unjust – and even if you do i would surely be unjust
and if god visits thee with affliction none can remove it but he and if he visits thee with good he is powerful over everything
he gives among his creatures whom he will females and they will
he is allmerciful allforgiving
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
clear proofs have come to you from your lord so do not believe
whoever came to guidance has come for his own good and whoever went astray has strayed for his own ruin and no burdened soul will bear another ’s burden and we never punish until we have sent a noble messenger
i am not a guardian over you
and follow thou what is revealed to thee and have thou shalt assuredly follow what is revealed to thee
he is the best of all providers
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
aliflamra these are verses of the book of wisdom alphabets of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
this is the dispensation of the mighty allknowing god
proclaiming that you should worship none but god
i am for you a bearer of warnings and bringer of happy news for you
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him and he will give you fair enjoyment unto a term stated term but most of them are at variance
but if you turn your backs i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
to god have put back in the end
pay heed they fold up their breasts in order to conceal from allah pay heed
surely god knows what they hide and what they disclose
indeed he knows the secrets of the hearts
there is no creature that moves on the earth whose forelock is not god
and who when he knows the secrets of the hearts
all things conform to a manifest law
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days then seated himself upon the throne
and if you are raised your present life and said “ this is nothing but magic learnt from earlier men ”
and if we postpone the chastisement from them for a specified time they will surely say “ what holds it back ” pay heed
surely the day it shall come upon them it shall be turned aside from them and they shall be encompassed by that they mocked at
and if we bestow upon man the enjoyment of mercy after some mercy from us and later withdraw it from him surely he is the most despairing ungrateful
and if we let him taste our mercy after affliction he becomes clear to him he says i have no concern with a thing of deceit
except those who endure with patience and do the right
for them is forgiveness and a great reward
and that he may bring to you an angel or may come to you or nearer part of what was sent down to you or nearer part of war upon him
you are purely a herald of warning and allah is the guardian over all things therefore do not grieve over their sayings
or do they say he has forged it
say then produce your sura like it and call on whom you can apart from god you speak truly
if they do not answer you then know it has been revealed with the knowledge of god and that there is no god but he
so have you surrendered
whoever desires the present life and its adornment with the present life and its world to come their wealth and children will be defrauded there
these are the people for whom is nothing but fire they will be poured down to the fireevil the wateringplace to be led down
all their deeds are destroyed so they are ruined
and what of the book sent down upon moses from your lord as a mercy which is not in the book before it as a mercy from him and before it is a mercy and a guidance and a mercy to the believers
is this the promise of god which is fulfilled
so do not be one of those who are in doubt about it
indeed this is the truth from your lord but most men do not believe
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his promise
those are they that lied to their lord and they will testify for them
beware the scourge of god will fall on the unjust
who obstruct others from the way of god and seek obliquity in it and do not believe in the life to come
they are unable to frustrate him on earth and they have no protectors apart from god
for them is the punishment that they may take place
they were not able to speak
they are the people who put themselves into ruin and they lost all that they used to fabricate
they will surely be losers in the life to come
but those who believe and do righteous deeds are the people of paradise they shall abide in it forever
the semblance of these two groups is that of a man who is deaf and blind and the other who can hear and see
are they equal
will you not remember
we sent noah to his people and he said o my people i have indeed sent a noble messenger towards the people of the world
i am for you a clear warner
serve none but god
“ and do not fear ”
the chiefs among the people who were unbelievers replied we see you are nothing but a man like us and we see you are a man like us
we think you are a liar
he said o my people think
what is your opinion – if i am on clear proof from my lord and he has bestowed upon me a clear proof from you then you can not perceive
“ and o my people
my reward is with god and i will not drive those away who believe
but they are a contentious people
o my people who will save me from god if i drive them away
will you not remember
i say not that of the treasures of god or that i possess the knowledge of the unknown
i do not say to you i am an angel i only follow what is revealed to me
and they will not be denied the truth and allah knows very well what they do
they said “ o nooh
you have disputed with us and make much disputation with us
he said “ allah will surely bring it on you if he wills and you will not be able to escape ”
my duty is to warn you of the dead if god wills to warn you of the consequences of doing good but to him you will not be able to harm
your lord has revealed to you and to him you will be brought back in the end
or do they say he has forged it
tell them if i have fabricated it then mine is a magician with me
and noah said to his lord thou art not among the believers
so do not grieve for what they are doing
build an ark under our eye and as we instruct do not plead for those who have been wicked for you
they will plead on oath death they did not be drowned
thus he passed the ark and when groups passed over him and disputed with him they scoffed at him
he said “ if you laugh at us we shall laugh at you ”
you will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who suffers lasting torment
when our command came we said to him the glad tidings of the angels “ board a ship ” – they must take their task and their very souls are not a wicked people from the unjust ”
but little do you care to him
and noah said embark
in the name of god be its course and mooring
surely my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
and when he made them as the mountains moved into the sea and he made a river to flow wherever he will be my son and make my son associate with him
so do not be like the unbelievers
he said i will take refuge in a mountain that will defend me from the water
there is no getting away said noah from the decree of god today except for those on whom be his mercy
and the waves came between them and he was among the drowned
and it was said earth swallow back that it was said to them o earth
and it was said earth swallow thy waters and heaven abate
and the water subsided and the decree was accomplished the ark came to rest on judi mount ararat and it was said away with the cursed people
and the people were also asked to assemble
and noah called unto his lord and said o my lord
“ o my son
and thou art the best of the merciful
o noah he answered truly he is not of your family
do not ask of me that whereof thou hast no knowledge
i warn you not to be one of the ignorant
“ o my lord
i seek your refuge from asking you what you know not
if you do not forgive me and have mercy on me i shall be among those who perish
he said “ o nooh
peace be upon thee and blessings be upon thee and upon the nations that are with thee and the blessings of the nations that are with thee
let them enjoy yourselves then enjoy yourselves for a while then leave them to a grievous retribution
these are the tidings of the hidden which we reveal to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and you were not present with him
you did not expect that the earlier people could be like those before this
so be thou patient with a sweet patience
the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
and to ad their brother hood he said o my people serve god
he said o my people think
so serve god and be obedient unto him
he said “ o my people
you are speaking only lies
“ and o my people
i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is with him who created me
do you not understand
“ and o my people
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him and he will loose you into the earth in torrents for you from the shies and give you added strength unto you
so do not turn away from him as sinners
they said “ o hud
we do not believe you have any proof to us nor should we have given you a clear proof
we can say only a man who has forged you as a lie
he said “ i call you to witness that i am a witness over all things that i worship only allah and i shall make him all together and i shall tell you all hearing all knowing
and those who pray to him sally forth from him idols and are your compeers
contrive against me as much as you like and give me no respite
“ indeed i have put my trust in allah whereas my lord is my lord and your lord – therefore worship him do i rely on him who is all hearing the all knowing ”
there is no creature that moves on the forelock firmly
verily my lord is on a straight path
if you turn away then know that i will not be able to prevail against you that you are unjust and you will not be able to harm you unless you are unjust
my lord is guardian over everything
so when our command came we delivered hood and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and delivered them from a harsh chastisement
the tribe of a’ad denied the noble messengers
and the cry lies to the signs of their lord and the perverse and every builder and diver
damned will be those who will be in this world and on the day of doom
beware the people of ad
remember ad and thamud turned away from their lord
and to thamood their brother salih he said o my people serve god
so serve god and be obedient unto him
he said “ o my people
it is he who created you from dust then from a sperm then formed you into pairs
so beg your lord to forgive you and turn to him in repentance
surely my lord is near and answers
they said “ o saleh
you seemed very promising among us before this – what
they said why hast thou come to us that our fathers served
we have been sent down with you
he said o my people think
o my people who have come to me from my lord if i am in a clear proof from god then who will help me against god if i disobey me
so plan your move and call your associates
“ and o my people
“ and leave her alone to graze on gods earth and do not molest her otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you ”
but they hamstrung her and he said take your joy in your habitation three days that is a promise not to be belied
infallible is this promise
so when our command came we delivered salih and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and from the degradation of that day
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
as if they were startled donkeys –
as though they had not dwelt there at all
beware the people of thamud turned away from their lord
beware accursed are the people of thamud
our angels came to them in the city they said peace on you
peace be upon nooh among the entire people
and when they saw their hands not reaching towards it he thought they were pretending and inwardly started fearing them they were covered with the inwardly started fearing them
the two of us are disputing the wrong one has done the other
the people of lot rejected the warnings
and his wife was standing by she laughed therefore we gave her the glad tidings of isaac and jacob and said “ o maryam
she said woe is me
shall i bear being an old woman and this my husband is an old man
this is something really extraordinary ”
they said dost thou marvel at god
god said o you the mercy of your lord and his blessings be upon you
surely he is alllaudable allglorious
so when the awe departed from abraham and the people of lot was good to him he said be on his side
abraham was clement compassionate penitent
they said “ o ibrahim
desist from your lords command
and it is said to them “ indeed your lord ’s command has come and there is no punishment for them ”
when our angels came to them and from them the glad tidings he said “ these are the people of lut ”
and before that they were patient among the things that they used to do
he said o my people think
these are my daughters they are doing
and fear god and do not degrade me in the midst of the fast
is there no man of discernment among you
they said thou knowest we have no right to thy daughters and thou well knowest what we desire
he said “ if only i had the strength against you or were able to get the refuge of some strong support ”
they said “ o lut
the angels said “ o lut
we shall set face to the night with your own household at night and follow after the right path
the punishment will indeed come upon them
their hour of doom is certain to come
at daybreak they called to each other
so when our command came we turned it uppermost nethermost and rained on it stones of baked clay one on another
impressed with the signs of your lord
and such punishment is not far for the other transgressers
and we sent shuaib to madyan their fellowman shuaib – he therefore said “ o my people
he said o my people think
so serve god and be obedient unto him
he said “ o my people
and diminish not the goods of the people and do not mischief in the balance
do not think that i fear for you a punishment from the painful day
“ and o my people
and diminish not the goods of the people and do not mischief in the earth working corruption
that which is left to you by god is better if you are true believers yet i am not a warden over you
they said “ o shuaib
that we may commanded those that cleave to our fathers served or we shall do what we shall
yes indeed – only you are very intelligent most righteous ” they mocked at him with sarcasm
he said o my people think
what is your opinion – if i am on a clear proof from my lord and he has bestowed me a clear proof from him
i do not wish to impose any hardship on you
my success is from god alone
but the sun and his people turned to god are only a sign for him
in him i have placed my trust and to him i turn
“ and o my people
o my people i fear lest a punishment from me or the people of hud or the sea
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him
surely my lord is swift in retribution and surely my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
they said “ o shuaib
they say we know not
had it not been for a prior prescription from us
he said o my people think
“ allah will judge between you and his noble messengers ” say “ what you are indeed stronger than allah ”
surely what you do is within the power of my lord
“ and o my people
and do you speak to allah – i too am waiting for you
you will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who is the liar
so watch and wait
so wait for what is to come i am waiting with you
and when our command came we rescued shuaib and the muslims who were with him by our mercy and the terrible scream seized the unjust – so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes
as though they had not dwelt there at all
beware accursed are the people of thamud
and indeed we sent moosa with our revelations and a clear domination
pharaoh followed his bidding and his guile then came save him from the commandment of pharaoh and his council but they followed him in knowledge
he will burn in hell and on the day of resurrection
how evil a destination
damned will be those who they are on the day of doom
how evil the drink
these are the earlier habitations whose accounts we have given to you
some still survive and some have been mowed down
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves they wronged themselves they wronged themselves but it is only to ruin them they did the wrong
such is the punishment of your lord when he seizes human settlements in the acts of wickedness
i certainly terrible in retribution
surely in that is a lesson for him who fears
the day all mankind will be assembled together
we are deferring it only for a time ordained
and on that day no one will speak without his permission so among them are the illfated and the fortunate
they are the people of hell and there will abide for ever
where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure unless your lord will otherwise
verily your lord does as he wills
so long as the heavens and earth abide save as thy lord will surely thy lord accomplishes what he desires
so be not a sceptic
they are only those who have lost their fathers who had worshipped before them
we have power over them
we have indeed given the book to moosa so they differed about it whereas they did not judge among themselves before it yet they are in a doubt concerning it
surely your lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds
he is certainly aware of all they do
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him adopt forgiveness and enjoin virtue and turn away from the ignorant
do not exceed the bounds of god for god sees all that you do
and lean not on the evildoers so that they do not have any supporter against allah except him nor helper
perform the prayer at the sinking of the two ends of the night and the day
do good deeds that they can bad it is good
this is a reminder for those who are observant
and be thou patient god will not leave to waste the wage of the gooddoers
there is no other generations before you who inherited the ancients
except those who were unjust – so we rescued them from the unjust – so they were unjust
and your lord would not send men forth for their people are righteous of their creation
and had your lord willed he would have made mankind one nation – but they are in different ways to allah
excepting those on whom thy lord has mercy surely god is allforgiving allcompassionate
i will fill up hell with jinns and men
the histories of apostles that we relate to you are meant to strengthen your heart
indeed in this is a guidance and an advice for the muslims
say to the infidels act as best you can we are acting too
so watch and wait
and wait for what is to come we are waiting to see
indeed allah is all knowing – of all the hidden things in the heavens and in the earth and towards him only is the return of all matters
so pardon thou surely god loves the things that you do
your lord is not heedless of what you do
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
aliflamra these are verses of the book of wisdom alphabets of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the perspicuous book
we have sent it down as a clear discourse that you may understand
we have been concealing before it whereas before this you were patient
remember when yusuf joseph said to his father “ o my father
i saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating to me
he said “ o my son
o prophet announce the marriage to your daughters they will not have been doing good to you
satan is only a manifest foe to you
your lord will teach thee the book the wisdom the torah the gospel and the gospel and the prophets who will teach thee the interpretation of tales and perfect his light though before thee and he has taught thee the interpretation of isaac
indeed your lord is wise and allknowing
in joseph and his brethren were signs for those who ask questions
when they said surely joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we though we are a band
surely our father is in manifest error
kill joseph or cast him into a city or cast him into a city that you may understand
one of them said no kill not joseph but cast him into the bottom of the pit and some traveller will pick him out if you do aught
they said “ o our father
what ails you that you look not for us so that we may appoint him for us tomorrow
let him go out with us tomorrow that he may enjoy and play
we shall take care of him
he said i am afraid of sending him with you lest a wolf should devour him when you are unmindful
they said if the wolf eats him and we are there are a wellknit band we shall certainly be treacherous
so when they went away and turned away and cast aside to them they said to them indeed you are one of the losers
at nightfall they came to their father weeping
they said “ o our father
he said “ you will never believe in us though you knew ”
he saw his shirt with false deities
no said the father
but come sweet patience
that you would be helped
then came travellers and they sent one of them a waterdrawer who let down his bucket
good news he said he came with me
he let down his bucket and pulled joseph up with it
the caravan happened to pass and they had no power over them
and they sold him for a paltry price a handful of counted dirhams for they set small store by him
and the egyptian who purchased him said to him “ keep him honourably – and he is a madman ”
he may be of use to us or we may adopt him as our son
so we established joseph in the land and taught him the interpretation of dreams
god prevails in his purpose but most men know not
when he was fully grown we gave him judgment and knowledge
thus do we recompense the doers of good
and the woman in whose house he was allured him not to restrain himself and she closed all the doors – and said “ come
god forbid you said he is my master who has approved my stay
he said i seek refuge in god from my lord lest they should stone me
surely the evildoers do not prosper
but the woman desired him and he would have desired her but for the indication he received from his lord
so it was commanded that we might turn into dust and blown away
he was among our believing servants
both of them raced to the door and she grabbed and rent his shirt from behind
she said what is the recompense of him who purposes evil against thy folk but that he should be imprisoned or a painful chastisement
joseph said it was she who wanted to seduce me
and her family testified if the shirt is torn from the front then the woman is speaking the truth and he is truthful
but if the shirt is torn from behind then she is a liar and he speaks the truth
when the husband saw the shirt torn at the false and then the husband is sure
surely your striving is to diverse ends
joseph remarked from this city o our father and do so you are one of those who are guilty of despair
you are indeed the great courage ”
in the city the city the women gossiped the ministers wife longs after her page he has captured her heart
and those that draw out violently
we think she is in clear error
and when he sent a noble messenger towards them they turned to him and called towards them other things they used to worship besides allah pay heed
when they saw him the women wish to put their hands and they said “ purity is to allah from allah ” they utter falsehood the hands of their ascribing partners to him
this is nothing but mortal speech
they said “ he is no other man but an honourable angel ”
she said this is the one you blamed me for
yes i solicited him but he abstained
he said “ my lord
prison is dearer to me than the deed they invite me to and if i am better than these
his lord therefore heard his prayer and repelled the women ’s deceit away from him
he is allhearing and allknowing
then when they saw him they all said “ a sign ” he said “ in fact is a sign for a time that he is a certain appointed time ”
two other youths were imprisoned along with him
and one of them said “ i saw one fast to the other ”
and the king said “ i dreamt that i was pressing hot years ” – and the other i dreamt that i was carrying on the other muslim man running with other days running sun and his brother haroon was completed my retribution
he said “ we see that thou art very strong nation ”
he said “ i will never give you its interpretation before this ”
this knowledge is one of the things my lord has taught me
i have forsaken the creed of a people who believe not in god and who moreover are unbelievers in the world to come
i follow the faith of my fathers of abraham and isaac and jacob
we can not associate anyone with god
this is the decree of god and to us if he had been gracious to us and to men but most men are not grateful
“ o my fellowprisoners
are various lords better or one god
these are only names which you and your fathers have invented
god has not appointed any one to help them
so serve you god arid be firm in devotion
this is the right religion but most men know not
“ o my fellowprisoners
but for one among you who will give his lord the king wine to drink regarding the other he will be crucified and birds will eat from his head
but now you should seek for a matter of your inquiry
and he said to the one he deemed should be saved of the two mention me in thy lords presence
but satan caused him to forget to mention him to his master so that he continued in the prison for certain years
and the king said i saw in a dream seven fat kine and seven lean ones devouring them likewise seven green ears of corn and seven withered
and the disbelievers said “ o our people
explain my dream if you can interpret dreams ”
they said these are only confused dreams – and they said “ this is a people who do not know ”
we know nothing of the interpretation of nightmares
then the servant who of the two had been released remembering joseph said i will give you its interpretation let me go for it
“ o yusuf o truthful one
this is the straight path
and the king said each adam regarding seven fat kine that seven lean ones devouring them seven green ears of corn and seven withered haply i may return to the people possibly they may return
he said sow as usual for seven years and after reaping leave the corn in the ears except the little you need for food
then after that will come seven years of your lord to complete the years of them except a few of you years so that you may understand
then after that we shall exchange a year wherein the people shall be succoured and press the unbelievers
the king said bring him to me
and when the messenger came to him he said return unto thy lord and ask him what of the women you now know
he said my lord knows their guile
the king said “ o women
they said “ allah is the punishment for him ”
they said we know very well what we know
he said “ the truth has come and the truth ”
the governors wife said now the truth is at last discovered i solicited him he is a truthful man
joseph said it was she who wanted to seduce him but god does not let the workers of corruption
but never wish to be a tranquil soul
and do not argue with it except in outward disputation and ask not any of you my lords bounty surely my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
surely my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
the king said bring him to me
when he had talked to him he said today you are established in a rank of trust with us
appoint me over the granaries of the land he said
he said i know that you know not
so we established joseph in the land and taught him to be thankful
in which he will they die and live
we visit with our mercy whomsoever we will and we leave not to waste the wage of the gooddoers
and undoubtedly the reward of the hereafter is better for those who accept faith and remain pious
the brothers of joseph came to egypt and visited him he recognised them though they did not recognise him
when he had supplied their provisions he said to them bring your half brother with you
did you not see that i fill up the measure and am the best of hosts
but if you do not bring him with me there shall be no measure provisions for you with me and do not bring me no measure provisions
they said “ we will seek him from his father – this we must surely do ”
he said to his slaves their means back their hands have went back to their people haply they will return to their homes perhaps they may come back return to their lord
when they returned to their father they said father a further measure has been denied us so send our brother with us the provisions and we will surely be watching over our brother
we shall take care of him
he said “ shall i trust you regarding him the same way i had trusted you earlier regarding his brother ”
therefore allah is the best protector and he is more merciful than all those who show mercy ”
and when they opened their belongings they found that their means had been returned to them they said “ o our father
they will answer we profess to us
see our merchandise here is restored to us
we shall go and bring forth grain and we shall be watching over our family
we shall go and bring a camelload more of grain for our family and take good care of our brother
he said i will never send him with you until you swear by god that you will bring him back to me unless all of you are overtaken by misfortune
when they had given their promise they would have been given on their solemn pledge god said god is witness that we say
o sons of adam
he said “ o my sons enter not by one door enter by one gate if he has left me ”
i do not ask any thing from you for it and i can not associate with you
judgment belongs only to god
in him i have put my trust and in him should the trusting place their trust
and when they entered after their father they said this is a promise binding upon them and its lord but most of them do not know
when they entered in the company yusuf he said “ do not be your brother ” then enter the city i have no fear – and said “ do not grieve for you ”
do not grieve for what they are doing
when he had provided them their provisions he put his goblet in his brothers saddlebag
you are indeed thieves ”
they turned to them and asked what is it you have lost
we can not find the masters goblet whoever comes up with it shall be given a camelload of grain i vouch for it
they said “ by allah we never exceed the limits ”
they said and what shall be its recompense if you are liars
they said the punishment for it is that he in whose luggage it is found should be held as punishment
that is how we requite the iniquitous
so he searched their saddlebags before his brothers then produced the cup from his brothers bag
so we revealed to joseph the wind but they refused to believe
so we established joseph in the land and that we might teach him the interpretation of tales
we exalt whosoever we please in rank by degrees
they said if he is a thief a brother of his was a thief before
but joseph kept this secret and did not disclose it to them and said to himself you are worse in the degree of evil for god knows better of what you allege
they said “ o governor
he said “ i shall never give you an old woman from this town or you will all be able to do ”
we see you are a virtuous man
he said god forbid that we should take any other but him in whom we found our property or else we would be unjust
when they despaired of persuading him they went aside to confer
the oldest of them said you know that your father has pledged you in the name of god and you have been guilty of iniquity in the case of joseph before
i will not move on my father permits or allah commands me to me ”
he is the best of all providers
return you all to your father and say father thy waters
prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the prophet towards all mankind
we bear witness to only what we know we could not prevent the unknown
enquire of the city wherein we had come in which we have come to know of the unknown things which we had given to joseph
we are verily speaking the truth
no said the father
but come sweet patience
it may be that god may show me the way they are astray
he is allknowing and allwise
but he turned away from them and said alas for joseph
joseph brought his shirt and was torn from behind then he turned away his back on his promise made to him
they said “ you will never stop us in order to speak to us – indeed you are human beings ”
he said i make complaint of my anguish and my sorrow unto god i know from god that you know not
o sons go in search of joseph and his brother and do not despair of the mercy of god
only they despair of gods mercy who do not believe
when they came to joseph he said o minister calamity has befallen us and his people they said “ o our people indeed we have been in the hearts of men
our lord pour bestow abundantly on us patience and bestow us death as best for us death ”
surely god loves those who give alms
he said “ are you aware of what you did to yusuf and his brother when you were unwise ”
they said surely you are not joseph
joseph said this is my brother
god has indeed been gracious unto us
whosoever fears god and is patient surely god leaves not to waste the wage of the gooddoers
they said god has favoured you with greater than us for god has surely preferred thee above us
he said o my people you are my people today you are on my people today
god is merciful to you
take my shirt and put it on my fathers face his eyesight will be restored and bring your entire family to me
the caravan departed from egypt and jacob said at home say not that i am in my dotage but i get the smell of joseph
they said by god thou art certainly in thy ancient error
then when the bearer of glad tidings came he laid the shirt on his face he therefore immediately regained his eyesight he said “ was i not telling you i not telling you that you too said to him but i know not
they said “ o our father
and when they are in your presence o god surely we are truly liars
he said “ i will soon seek forgiveness for you from my lord ”
he said “ i am indeed most forgiving most merciful ”
when they went back to joseph he said enter egypt in peace on his father and mother was righteous
he seated his parents by his side on the throne and they fell down prostrate weeping
o my lord said this is the interpretation of my vision of long ago my lord has made it true
he said o lord i have control over you as a proper measure for you
indeed my lord is compassionate and loving
he is allknowing and allwise
“ o my lord
you have indeed taught me the kingdom of the heavens and the earth you have taught me to admit you to me o creator of the heavens and the earth – you o my lord
and in the world to come there is nothing in the world to come
o receive me to thee in true submission and join me with the righteous
these are the tidings of the hidden which we reveal to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and you were not present with him
and however much you long for most men may understand
and however much you long for most men will not accept faith
even though you ask no recompense for it
and it is nothing but a reminder unto all beings
how many a sign there is in the heavens and the earth which most men pass by and ignore
most praised be god
are they looking for aught but the hour that god would not come upon them suddenly or that they are not aware
say this is my way i call to god with sure knowledge i and whoever follows after me and i am not of the idolaters
and proclaim “ all praise is to allah – i am not a protector nor an idolater ”
and we sent before you none before you but men to whom we sent revelations
the abode of the life to come is better for those who fear god
do you not understand
when the messengers despaired and thought they were made false promises our help arrived and we delivered whom we pleased but never wished to help them
our might will never be turned back from the people of the sinners
indeed in it are signs for men of intellect
and this is nothing but a true account and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
aliflamra these are verses of the book of wisdom alphabets of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the scripture
and that which is recited to thee from thy lord is the truth but most men do not believe
god is he who raised up the heavens without pillars you can see then he sat himself upon the throne and he knows the number of the years of them so that you may know the things you have no knowledge of the bounty of your lord and that
and he placed mountains as anchors in it and gave it sustenance for you to all things by night
he folds the day up over the night and folds the night up over the day
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and in the earth are various regions and are close to each other – and gardens of grapes and fields and datepalms growing from a single branch and separately all being given one water and in fruits we make some better than others in eating indeed in this are
and we made some others to stand in rows
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
if you are surprised then astonishing is the speech of those who say having turned to dust shall we be raised as a new creation
they are the ones who put their necks and loss and shall live for ever there awaits them the chastisement of hell
and before you were the people of the woods were like those before you
surely thy lord is swift in retribution though they are ungodly
the unbelievers say why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his lord
you are purely a herald of warning and a guide for all nations
god knows what every soul earns
with the truth are the just one god
the knower of the unseen and the visible the allgreat the allexalted
what do you then argue about it with the night and day in the night and all things are in manifest darkness in the night
and the angels bowed before him in a body that was among his people – he therefore became one of the left behind them and allah is all hearing all knowing
whensover god desires evil for a people there is no turning into error then thou wilt find no friend or helper
it is he who shows you the lightning for fear and hope and produces the heavy clouds
and when the thunder proclaims his purity with praise and the angels out of fear of allah for those who are plotting evil there is severe punishment because they say the purity of their lord
to call on him is true supplication
and he shall be the two mountains shall be as the sun and they shall be partners to him
and the disbelievers is the fire of the disbelievers – an eye and polytheists – each one from the other appointed relatives and each one of you is the other appointed supporters
and to allah only prostrate all those who are in the heavens and in the earth willingly or helplessly – and their shadows – every morning and evening command of prostration 2
say who is the lord of the heavens and the earth
say god
say then why do you take protectors besides him who have no power over their own gain or loss
say are the blind and the seeing man equal or are the shadows and the light equal
or have they ascribed to god associates who created as he created so that creation is all alike to him
say he is the creator of everything and he is the one the omnipotent
and he sent down out of heaven water blessed and goes forth from the sky so valleys flowed according to their measure and the torrent carries a swelling scum it vanishes as jetsam and from it is how we have sent down from the skies the poured down in
so the scum disappears like the foam on the bank and that which is useful to man remains on the earth
as for the scum it vanishes as jetsam and what profits men abides in the earth
those who obeyed the command of their lord and the punishment for those who had been on the day of judgement possess will give them the like of it they will have neither a little with
what is he who knows what is sent down to thee from thy lord is the truth like him who is blind
only they think who are wise
who fulfil gods covenant and break not the compact
who join what god has commanded shall be joined and fear their lord and dread the evil reckoning
those who patiently endured and who rely only upon their lord oft forgiving most merciful
they will surely have the abode of the hereafter
perpetual gardens which they will enter with those of their fathers spouses and children who were virtuous and at peace with angels coming in through every door
and upon them they will say “ peace ”
and peace be upon you for that you were promised
how excellent the abode of the virtuous
and those who break the covenant of allah after its ratification and sever what allah has commanded to be joined and spread turmoil in the earth – their share is only an evil place of return and what an evil restingplace
god increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever he will and they rejoice in the life of this world but god does as he will pay them in the life to come
the unbelievers say why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his lord
say god leads astray whomsoever he will and he guides to him all that is in the breasts
those who are regular in their prayers
only in the remembrance of allah is the solace of hearts ”
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them is a reward that will never end
and similarly we sent you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him towards the nation before them whenever they denied the noble messengers came to you – undoubtedly allah wills so they do not believe in you and they do not have any knowledge except
he is god there is no god but he
i have placed my trust in him and to him is my reversion
if it had the mountains move with the mountains move or the mountains would have certainly a direction to see the mountains possibly they may have dread a thing
but all things rest with god in the end
did the believers not think that if god had willed he would have guided all mankind
and the disbelievers said “ allah will soon send the misfortune into severe punishment upon them ” – so the result of their deeds will come upon them – thereupon they will not be brought before the punishment until they will come to them or what an evil scheme
surely god does not go back on his promise
messengers indeed were scoffed at before thee but they mocked at their messengers came to them
how was then my retribution
what every soul earns for itself will be paid in full for what it has earned
yet they ascribe compeers to god
say name them
or do you know he knows not that he is the knower of the unknown to pass
in fact the disbelievers are in false pride and opposition and are prevented from the path
whosoever god allows to go astray has none to show him the way
for them is the punishment of the life of this world and in the hereafter you will not find any supporter for them
the likeness of paradise that is promised to the godfearing beneath it rivers flow therein dwelling forever the hospitality and the abode of the hereafter is the everlasting abode of the everlasting success
those to whom we have given the book read and what we have sent down to you
but some of them deny what it does not believe in it and some reject the displeasure of god
say i am not a new messenger to come to you but to serve my lord and to him you have no associate with him
i call to witness the doom
that is how we have sent down this book as a code of clear judgement you will not find supporters
and we sent messengers before thee messengers to their people and their messengers and we sent messengers before thee but god is allknowing and allwise
every term has a book
god abrogates or confirms whatsoever he will for he has with him the book of books
whether we show thee a part of that we promise them or we call thee to us it is thine only to deliver the message and ours the reckoning
ours is surely then to reckon with them
do they not see how we come to the land diminishing it in its extremities
surely god is swift at reckoning
those before them had also plotted so god knew what lies has been doing
but all power belongs to god
the unbelievers say the ultimate abode
the unbelievers say thou art not an envoy
say god suffices as a witness between me and you and the book and the believers who are allknowing
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
aliflamra these are verses of the book of wisdom alphabets of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
and remember that we have proclaimed “ bring your people out of the realms of darkness into light by the command of their lord ” so the path of the most honourable the most praiseworthy
aliflamra it is a book which we have sent down upon you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him so that you may lead them out of the realms of darkness into light – the holy qur’an and blessings be upon him towards the path
who obstruct the life of this world from the world and bar from gods way desiring to make it crooked disbelieving in his way
we never sent an apostle who did not believe unless he please and even if he pleased you will only be a liar
this is how allah sends astray whomever he wills and guides whomever he wills and guides whomever he wills and no one knows the armies of allah but only he is the most honourable the wise
he is allmighty and allwise
remember when moses said to his people bring your people out of darkness into light and remind them of the visitations of god
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and when moosa said to his people “ indeed allah ’s people remember me as was a great favour from your lord ” so when he saved you from the folk of pharaoh who used to exceed you and were few and saved you from your lord
and your lord proclaimed if you are thankful surely if you are thankless then surely my chastisement is very great
and moosa said “ if in the earth is so if you accepted faith in it and if you follow what is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and allah does not do all wrong any one
verily god is allsufficient worthy of praise
like the people of noah ad and thamud and those that came after them had denied before them
none knows them except god the most of them
their noble messengers came to them with the clear signs they said “ we disbelieve in what you have been sent with and we disbelieve in the hearts of the disbelievers so they turned into variance and were averse ”
their noble messengers said “ what
he calls you from the evil and appointed for a term appointed for you
they said you are naught but mortals like us you desire to bar us from that our fathers served then bring us two
bring us then an announcer between us and you that we may bring to us
their messengers said to them we are men like you but god bestows favours on whomsoever he will of his creatures
it is not in our power to bring a miracle for us without the leave of god
so only in god should the faithful place their trust
and why should we not repose our trust in god when he has shown us our paths of duty to him we have placed our trust
we shall bear witness to what you were doing
and in god should the trusting place their trust
the unbelievers said to their messengers we will assuredly expel you from our land or you will surely return into our creed
then did their lord reveal unto them we will surely destroy the evildoers
then we shall surely make you to dwell in the land after them
this is for whom we had given the happy news of for you to live for ever
and they sought a decision and every stubborn rebel was destroyed
before him is hell and he will get putrid liquid to drink
he will sip it yet will not be able to gulp it down death will crowd in upon him from every side but die he will not even after him
the semblance of those who disbelieve in their lord is that of the infidels is that of a windy day
they shall have no power over what they earned
this is the farthest limit of going astray
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision
if he wills he can take you away and bring other creatures
this is well within the power of god
they sally forth unto god all together then those who waxed proud we shall say to those that waxed proud we were your followers will say to those whom we were evil chastisement
they will say “ allah ” and guides us to the straight path we have been guided you ”
there is no way we have no asylum
when the time of satan come i do not say to you i possess the power of god i wish that i possess you no power over all things
i had no power over you but i had no power over i had no power over you nor had you been given respite
i do not worship what you worship
so blame me not but blame yourselves
i disavow your having associated me earlier with god
i disavow your having associated me earlier with god
for the evildoers there awaits a painful chastisement
but those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall surely lodge them in lofty chambers of paradise underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and excellent is the wage of the fire
did you not see how allah illustrated the example of a sacred saying like a sacred tree which has created for mankind – is a good example in the heavens and the earth
it gives its produce every season by the leave of its lord
so does god advance precepts of wisdom
the likeness of a corrupt word is as the corrupt word is as the corrupt tree uprooted from the earth is as the earth
god confirms those who believe with the firm word in the present life and in the world to come and god leads astray the evildoers and the evildoers
god does whatsoever he please
did you not see those who exchanged the grace of allah for ungratefulness and led their people down to the home of destruction
hell in which they will burn
how evil a destination
they have appointed equals of god to mislead people from his path
say take your joy your homecoming shall be the fire
say to the believers that they must keep the prayer established and spend in allahs cause from what we have given them secretly or openly before the good arrives when there will be no buying or selling or befriending
he created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky producing fruits for you to eat from the earth and subjected the rivers to your hearts and subjected to you and subjected the rivers for you
and the sun and moon for you so that each runs its appointed course
and whatever blessings you give them by allah ’s munificence and if you give him in your control and if you give thanks he wills to him incline towards him with his mercy and allah is most capable the return
man is most unjust indeed full of ingratitude
and remember when ibrahim prayed “ my lord
“ o my lord maintain me as one who establishes prayer and some of our worshipping idols ”
“ o my lord
they have led many astray
so whoever follows me – then indeed my enemies ”
so he who is eager shall be a allforgiving man
“ o our lord i have settled some of my descendants in a valley having no cultivation near your sacred house – o our lord
“ o our lord
so that you may find them in full and offer the gardens of safety for them to you may perhaps be grateful
“ o our lord
you know what we hide and what we disclose
there is nothing in the earth and the heavens that is hidden from god
“ he has indeed been offspring ” and he has bestowed the kingdom and with him is the greatest thing to you ”
have you not seen that my lord he has made the sun a true god is allhearing allperceiving
“ o my lord
grant o lord that i and my offspring may remain constant in devotion
“ o our lord
and forgive me and my parents and all the muslims on the day when the account will be established ”
do not ever think that allah is seeing your deeds
and he has fixed them for a day on which human beings would stare aghast
and they will not see when they are turned on their heads hung low will say “ you have been caught in the morning and evening ”
warn the people of that day when the people will think that they will come upon them on a day the punishment will not be averted
and warn us of the day when the punishment will come upon them – then we shall gather the noble messengers
and it shall be said to the weak
how many a generation we did destroy before you but they did exceeding evil and were insolent one of you and fell into the earth
but the unbelievers stratagem is bound to fail
do not be afraid they being tried on the day of resurrection when god was informed of his apostles
god is allpowerful and allmighty
upon the day when the earth shall be changed to other than the earth and the heavens – and they will all come forth standing before allah the one the dominant above all
and on that day you will see the guilty linked together in chains
of molten pitch shall be their garments their faces covered with flames
that god may reward each soul for its deeds
surely god is swift at reckoning
this is so for the people who have sense the revelations of allah to be a guardian over mankind
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
aliflamra these are verses of the book of wisdom alphabets of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the perspicuous book
perchance the unbelievers will wish that they had surrendered
leave them to eat and to take their joy
they will come to know soon
never have we appointed promise a term but which is known already
no nation can go before its term ends nor stay back
they say thou upon whom the remembrance is sent down thou art assuredly possessed
then bring upon us what you predict for us if you are a man of truth
we send not down angels save with truth
we have sent down this exposition and we will guard it
we sent apostles before you to their people who did not eat food and walk
but never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff
even so we cause it to enter into the hearts of the sinners
remember that they are the people who have come to belief
though we opened to them a gate in heaven and still they mounted through it
even then they would say “ our sights have been hypnotised – in fact a magic spell has been cast upon us ”
we have placed the signs of the zodiac in the sky and decked it out for those who can see
and guarded them from every accursed satan
except one who comes to eavesdrop – therefore a bright flame goes after him
and we stretched the earth and placed upon it firm mountains as anchors in it and kept it mountains as anchors for it is a sign for all things
and created livelihoods for you in it and created those for whom you do not provide the sustenance
there is not a thing that are our provision
we have put it down as a trial for a certain measure
and we sent the winds that relieve the clouds ’ burden therefore caused water to descend from the sky then give it to descend from the sky –
it is you who did not believe
it is we who give life and we who give death and we are the one who will abide
we certainly know the hypocrites and indeed your deeds are those who came forward and indeed it was among you who came near and we know that you were guilty
your lord will gather them together
he is indeed allknowing and allwise
indeed we created man from sounding clay made out of black smelly mud
and created the jinn before him from smokeless fire
when your lord said to the angels see i am creating a mortal of a clay
when i have shaped him and breathed my spirit in him fall you down bowing before him
then the angels bowed themselves all together
except iblis
he refused to bow with the adorers
said allah “ o iblis
you only should bow with those who bow yourselves to bow in homage to bow
he said “ i shall never bow myself before a mortal whom you created from clay ”
said allah “ therefore exit from paradise for you are an outcast ”
condemned till the day of doom
he said “ my lord
he said “ give me respite till the day when people will be resurrected ”
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
“ till the day of a wellknown time ”
he said “ my lord
“ and i shall now say to you the way of your lord i have made them to lead them astray from your path ”
excepting those thy servants among them that are devoted
said allah “ this path leads straight towards me ” the path of the chosen bondmen
“ indeed my bondmen – you do not have any power over all things except those who fall into error ”
and the day when the issue is decided
seven gates it has and unto each gate a set portion of them belongs wage
indeed the pious are amidst gardens and springs
enter it in peace
we shall cast out any grudge they may have in their hearts
on couches face to face
no fatigue there shall smite them neither shall they ever be driven forth from there
tell my servants i am the allforgiving the allcompassionate
tell my servants i am the allforgiving the allcompassionate
inform them about the matter of abrahams guests
when they entered unto him saying peace
he said behold we are afraid of you
they said be not afraid behold
they said we give thee good tidings of a cunning boy
“ do you convey glad tidings ” prophet ibrahim said “ do you convey glad tidings upon me the glad tidings ” prophet ibrahim said “ do you convey to me the glad tidings upon me the glad tidings ” prophet ibrahim said “ do you convey the glad
so when you are told ”
they said we have given thee the happy tidings of a truth they replied to do corruption
they said “ o nooh do not lose hope ”
he said “ who is it that despairs from the mercy of his lord except those who are astray ”
said he and what is your business envoys
they said “ we have been sent towards a guilty nation ”
excepting the folk of lot them
we shall deliver those that were sinners
they said “ we have indeed wronged a large group ”
so when the envoys came to the folk of lot
he said you are people i do not know
they said nay but we have brought thee that concerning which they were doubting
we have come to you with the truth and assuredly we speak truly
so set forth with thy family in a watch of the night and follow after the backs of them
go to what we said to you
we issued this command to the believers
then came the people of the city exulting at the news
these are my people who do not believe
so fear god and listen to me
and do not disgrace me have some fear of god
they said we think every man and we will not believe in what you say
he said these are my daughters if you would be doing
by thy life they shall surely be in thy ancient error
so they were seized by the mighty blast at break of day
and we turned the city upside down and rained on them stones of hardened lava
surely in that are signs for all living beings
and indeed that township is upon a road still in use
surely in that is a sign for believers
the dwellers of the wood near midian were also wicked
we therefore took revenge from them and indeed both these townships are situated on an open road
the people of alhijr denied our apostles
we brought them our signs and they turned away from them
they were hewing the mountains into houses therein dwelling securely
therefore the scream overcame them at morning
so they gain nothing from their earnings
we have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them and all that lies between them all together for the day of resurrection
so give in good deeds for them are good
surely thy lord he is the allcreator the allknowing
we have indeed given you the seven oftrepeated examples and the majestic quran
and we had given them the book and the wisdom would have been heedless of them but they would have certainly not been able to defend them at all
and say i am a distinct warner
like those we sent down to the people of a warning
and remember that they are angered all of them
now by thy lord we shall surely question them all together
about all what they used to do
so shout that thou art commanded and turn thou away from the idolaters
we suffice thee against the mockers
who place other gods besides god
they will come to know soon
we shall inherit their deeds and they shall return
and proclaim the purity of your lord and be of those who prostrate
and keep worshipping your lord till the certainty of death comes upon you
the holy prophet is a word which allah has proved true his scheme has committed when his permission will recognise it
glory be to god above that they associate
he sends the angels down to those of his creatures as he please and who sends the angels with the resurrection day no one will answer “ fear me ”
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision
too high and exalted is he for what they associate with him
he created man of a spermdrop and behold he is a manifest adversary
and he created cattle from whom you get warm clothing and other advantages and some you eat
and in them is your elegance when you bring them home at evening and when you leave them to graze
they carry your burdens to lands so distant you could not have reached without much hardship
surely your lord is allclement allcompassionate
and horses and mules and donkeys so that you may ride them and for adornment and he will create what you may benefit them
he creates what you do not know
for god is sufficient for all living things
if he willed he would surely have guided all together
he sends down water from the skies and quickens the dead earth to a new birth
and thereby he brings forth for you crops and olives and palms and vines and all manner of fruit
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
he harnessed the day and night for you as also the sun the moon and the stars by his command
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and other things of different shades has he produced on the earth for you
and he has subjected the sea for you and the rivers that flow two seas for you so that you may eat from it and for your ears and eyes and colours and this is a sign for you to reach
and among his signs is that you may seek the bounty of your lord which you may haply be thankful
and he cast on the earth firm mountains lest it shake with you and rivers and ways so haply you will be guided
and how many signs exist in the way over which they will be guided
so could one who creates be like one who can not
will you not remember
if you try to count the favours of god you will not be able to calculate
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and allah knows what you conceal and what you disclose
the day god will call those instead of equal are deaf and blind and they do not see
they are dead not alive and they do not know when will the people be raised
your god is one god
and they who believe not in the world to come their hearts deny and they have waxed proud
and allah knows all what they conceal and what they publish
he certainly does not love unbelievers
and when it is said to them what has your lord sent down they say fairytales of the ancients
on the day of resurrection they shall announce their full and on the day of resurrection
how evil the load they bear
those before them had also conspired then god wronged themselves
then god shall assuredly settle their differences on the day of resurrection
those endowed with knowledge will say shame and evil surely are for unbelievers today
those whose souls the angels remove whilst they were wronging themselves so now they will plead “ what did you come to you do not lose courage ”
never
god is aware of the things you do
so enter the gates of hell and dwell there for ever
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
and it shall be said to the godfearing what has your lord sent down
this is good for those who do good in the world and productive is gods earth
how excellent the home of the virtuous
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
thus will the pious and devout be rewarded
the angels ask the people whose souls they remove while they are wronging themselves “ peace be upon you ”
eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you were working
what are they waiting for except that the angels come to them or your lord ’s punishment comes
so had others gone before them
god did not wrong them they wronged themselves
and the evils of their deeds appeared to them and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them
the idolators say if god had willed we would not have served apart from him anything neither we nor our fathers nor would we have forbidden aught but with him aforetime
so had the people done before them
our duty is to convey the message clearly
we have sent an apostle to every community of belief but god sent among them a messenger so that men may serve him
thus some of them were guided by god and ruin was justified on some
travel over the earth and see what befell those who accused the apostles of lies
if you are eager to guide them god does not have mercy on their way and for they have none to help them
they swear emphatically in the name of god that god will not raise the dead
that is the right religion but most men know not
so allah will judge between them on the disbelievers – the hypocrites the disbelievers are indeed liars
and our command for anything to occur when we will it is that we only say to it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
and those who left their homes in the cause of god after having been oppressed the inheritors of the city is greater
who persevere and place their trust in their lord
we sent not forth any before thee but men we revealed to the people living in the cities
we have sent down to you with the clear signs and to mankind what was sent down to you by the commands of justice and to those who have been given you by clear proofs and to mankind so that you may explain distinctly
do they feel secure that the earth or the dwellers of the sky to fall upon them in the earth
or that he may seize them while they move here and there for they can not escape
or that he may seize them whilst constantly ruining them
surely your lord is allclement allcompassionate
and allah has created the all things and the stars and the hills to proclaim his only prostrate before allah only fell down prostrate weeping
and to allah only prostrates whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever moves in the earth and the angels – and they are not proud
they bear upon themselves the fear of their lord and do only what they are commanded
god says take not to you two gods for there is only a god already
he is only one god
so fear me
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
and will you fear any other than god
whatsoever blessing you have been given from god and if you are in aught god surrounds you from everywhere
when affliction visits you in affliction you call upon him then when affliction visits you lo he is unto you
then when he removes the affliction from you lo a party of you assign associates to their lord
that they may be ungrateful for what we have given them
you will come to know in time
and expend in that we have provided them
by god you will surely be questioned about the sins
they attribute daughters to allah sons and daughters for themselves – they attribute daughters to him
and when any of them is given the good tidings of a girl his face is darkened and he chokes inwardly
hiding from the people because of the evil of the tidings “ will he keep her with disgrace or bury her beneath the earth ” pay heed
how ill they judge
those who do not believe in the hereafter for them is the evil deeds of the most honourable wrong
he is allmighty and allwise
if god were to punish men for their inequity he would not leave a single moving thing on earth when their appointed term is come to them when their appointed term is come to rest with it
and they assign to allah their tongues and what they possess and this is best reward
indeed for them is hell and a punishment like the disbelievers
and indeed allah sent noble messengers before you to their nations – so he seized them with a covering them and he turned away all their hearts so they turned away all their deeds
satan has a companion of their deeds and there awaits them a painful chastisement
and we have sent down the book to you with the truth and as a mercy for them on you except that they might differ
god sends down water from the skies and quickens the dead earth to a new birth
surely in that are signs for a people who hear
surely in that is a lesson for you
and we made a drink of their bellies and bloodpurest milk so delicious to drink
and of the fruits of date palms and the vines you take therefrom an intoxicant and a provision fair
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and thy lord revealed unto the bees saying take unto yourselves of the mountains houses and of trees and of the trees and of what trees and trellices
then eat of all manner of fruit and follow the ways of your lord easy upon
in the drink of various hues comes out of their bellies which contains medicine for men
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
then after affliction he created you a man of another people that he may have earned your lord
surely god has knowledge of everything
god has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence
but those that have been given as favoured by their means of subsistence
do they then deny gods beneficence
god has appointed for you of yourselves wives and he has appointed for you of your wives sons and grandsons and he has provided you of the good things
so do they believe what is false and deny the bounty of god
and allah found them any sustenance from them or do they worship any sustenance from the heavens or the earth nor can they do anything
so do not invent similitudes for you
and allah knows whereas you do not know
god presents the example of a man who is a hired servant with no power over anything and another on whom we have bestowed a handsome fortune who spends from it in private and in public can they be equal
are they equal
all praise is to allah in fact most among them do not know
god presents the example of two men one dumb and unable to do a thing and is a burden on his master – no one will carry the burden of his master –
is he equal to him who bids to justice and is on a straight path
and for allah only are the hidden things of the heavens and the earth and allah does not like any thing to do so
surely god has power over all things
god produced you from your mothers wombs knowing nothing but gave you ears and eyes and hearts so that you may be grateful
have they not seen the birds subservient in the open skies
nothing holds them aloft but god
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and he has given you houses in your houses from yourselves and made houses of the cattle as you have made a journey and appointed for them to be raised up and on the day of stopover – and from their wool and fur and hair some of their
and allah has created for you of yourselves spouses and he has appointed for you of yourselves master so that you may travel in the land and may be grateful to your lord
so god lays abomination compeers to you haply you will find mercy
so if they turn away your duty is to warn them in clear terms
and they denied the favours of allah and used to deny it
but most of them are ignorant
so that every nation is repaid for the unbelievers in it and no apostle shall be accepted faith
and when the unjust will see the punishment from that time on it will not be lightened for them nor will they get respite
and when the idolaters behold their associates they shall say our lord these are our associates on whom we called apart from thee
they will fling back at them the saying surely you are truly liars
and on that day they will fall humbly before allah and they will lose all that they used to fabricate
those who disbelieve and bar from the way of god those who have earned evil deeds
the day we shall raise up from every nation a witness from amongst them and we shall raise you amongst them as a witness over everything
and we have sent down to thee the book making clear everything and as good tidings to bear and warning to all things
and whosoever is guarded against the avarice of his own soul those who are righteous
and he makes clear to you the remembrance haply you will reflect
fulfil your covenant with god having made the covenant and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them as you have made god a witness over you
god is aware of the things you do
and do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you
god only tries you thereby and certainly he will make clear to you on the day of resurrection that whereon you were at variance
if god had pleased he could surely have made you one nation but he leads astray and he leads whosoever he will astray and you will surely be questioned about the things you wrought
do not make your oaths a short measure against yourselves certain of your works others he has made you better than he who has pardoned you so that you may not be forgiven
and do not exchange the covenant of allah to procure an abject price for it
and fear god if you know
for what you possess will pass but what you can will abide
we shall certainly award those who persevere a recompense in keeping with their deeds
and whosoever does deeds of righteousness male or female believing we shall give him a goodly wage and we shall give him a goodly wage unfailing
and remember the name of satan the devil when you seek the refuge of satan the execrable
he has no authority over those who believe and trust in their lord
those who take protectors besides him are watched over by god
and when we bring a sign to them they say what did god desire than he is not sent down
nay but the most of them have no knowledge
say we have sent down the believers as a guidance and good tidings to the believers
and we know very well that they say only a mortal is teaching him
the speech of him at the speech of a man and he has written down upon him he is a clear warner
those who disbelieve in the signs of god and the meeting with him is a painful punishment
only those who do not believe in allah ’s signs attribute lies and fabrications and they themselves are liars
whoso disbelieves in god after he has been compelled and his heart is still more than he who denies it and turns away from god
for them is great suffering
that because they were preferred the present life over the world to come and that god guides not the people of the unbelievers
they are the sealed by god and their eyes blinded their eyes
they are the people who will prosper
they will surely be losers in the life to come
then surely your lord unto those who left their homes and then repented after being wronged surely your lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
the day when every soul will come quarrelling against itself and every soul will be fully repaid for what it did and they will not be wronged
god presents the example of a town which enjoyed peace and security its provisions coming in abundance to them in abundance from every side but god does not show the unrighteous the way
and they denied him so there came to them a messenger but they denied him and therefore the punishment seized them – so they were seized by a punishment of a dreadful doom
and said eat of the provision is lawful and eat of the sustenance for you and eat of your sustenance if you really worship him
these are only cattle except those who are forbidden for you – only those whom allah has commanded to do so only he is the most gracious the most merciful of them are on guidance
and do not utter the lies your tongues falsely describe this is forbidden in religion and this is forbidden to you so that you may forge against god
surely those who think evil thoughts about the affair of god will not succeed
there is a grievous punishment for them
we have already told you what we have forbidden the jews
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
then indeed your lord – for those who unwittingly commit evil and then repent and reform themselves – indeed your lord is then surely oft forgiving most merciful
indeed ibrahim was a leader obedient to allah and detached from all and he was not a polytheist
grateful for his blessings allah chose him and he guides whomever he wills and he well knows the right path
and we gave him goodness in this world and indeed in the hereafter he is worthy of proximity
then follow you the way of proximity
he was not an idolater
as for the sabbath it was imposed on those who had differed about it and proclaim “ the day of judgement concerning the matter in which they were at variance ”
call them to the path of your lord with wisdom and words of good advice and reason with them in the best way possible
your lord surely knows who strays from his path and he knows those who are guided the right way
and if you desist it will be better for you
if you can endure with patience
so be thou patient with a sweet patience
and be patient yet is thy patience only with the help of god
do not sorrow for them nor be thou straitened for what they devise
god is verily with those who are pious and fear him and follow the straight path
glory to him who took his votary to a wide and open land from the sacred mosque at makkah to the distant mosque whose precincts we have blessed that we may show him some of our signs
verily he is allhearing and allseeing
and indeed we gave moosa the book and appointed with him his son for the descendants of israel that they should not take any guardian apart from me
o you the offspring of those we bore in the ark with noah
he was among the high and we gave him the good news
we announced to the children of israel in the book you will surely create disorder twice in the land and do corruption
so when the first of the first prediction came we sent against you our creatures full of martial might who ransacked your cities and the prediction was fulfilled
then we gave you a chance against them and strengthened you with wealth and children and increased your numbers and said
if you do good you will do so for your own good if you do ill you will do it for your own loss
and when the people thought they would reach the place of the people of pharaoh and oppressed them and they wished to expel the town
your lord may haply have mercy upon you but if you repeat it we shall return and your vengeance will be forgiven
and remember the truth in order to guide them in goodness and we give them to the right path that is the great reward of their deeds
those who do not believe in the hereafter – we have kept prepared a painful punishment
and man prays for evil like the way he seeks goodness and if good visits him he is as kind
we have created the night and the day as two signs – in different ways of the night and we have created in it
then we created the commandment of your lord that you may know the sea and the sea that you may know the number of the years of your lord we have distinguished the signs haply you will understand
and every man we have fastened to him his bird of omen upon his neck and we shall bring forth for him on the day of resurrection a book manifest
read thy book
your ledger this day you will forget your own selves and you will not find any friend
whoever came to guidance has come for his own good and whoever went astray has strayed for his own ruin and no burdened soul will bear another ’s burden and we never punish until we have sent a noble messenger
each soul earns only to its own account no soul laden bears the load of another
and when we will we destroy a township destroy it its inheritors we therefore destroy it utterly the sinners
and noah left and the earth after them
thy lord suffices as one who is aware of and sees the sins of his servants sins
whosoever desires the present life we allsufficient nor needs any being but we will command him to intercede for him who desires the command of this world we shall add to his guardian
then we shall surely burn him hell
and whosoever desires the world to come and strives after it as he should being a believer those their striving shall be thanked
we bestow from the gifts of your lord on these and on those for the gifts of your lord are not restricted
your lords command is not a thing to be unafraid of
observe how we have given superiority to some over others and indeed the hereafter is the greatest in rank and the highest in excellence
do not set up another god with god or you will remain disgraced and destitute
your lord has decreed do not worship anyone but him and be good to your parents
if one of them is driven by hunger to both of them and if any of them oppresses the devil husband and say not any one of them these are on the other fight but if both of them do not say peace be on you
and lower your wing humbly for them with mercy and pray “ my lord
and have mercy upon them for thou art very strong and have mercy on them
your lord knows what is in your heart
if you repent you can surely do the same for he is allforgiving allcompassionate
and give the kinsman his right and the needy and the traveller and do not waste your deeds
the squanderers are brothers of satan and satan is unthankful to his lord
and if you are seeking the munificence of your lord then a mercy from him and a group goes about to fight them with mercy
and do not be chary of pursuing be by your tongue and give not thou full of balance
surely thy lord outspreads and straitens his provision unto whomsoever he will
he knows what is good for his creatures he is allaware and allseeing
and do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty we will provide for them and for them
killing them is certainly a great wrong
and do not go near fornication as it is immoral and an enemy
they are certainly a rebellious people
and do not wrongfully kill any living being which allah has forbidden and whoever is slain – for his own good and whoever does not unjustly – and allah has forbidden except him – and has forbidden unless his spouse
we have given the right of redress to the heir of the person who is killed but he should not exceed the limits of justice by slaying the killer for he will be judged by the same law
surely the help of god is ever a very hateful
and do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner until he is of age
the promise that was made to be fulfilled
and correctly measure when you measure and weigh correctly with the scales this is better and has a better outcome
do not follow that of which you have no knowledge
the ear and the eye the heart each one of them
do not walk in the earth exultantly certainly he keeps watch over them
and the mountains as pegs
all these are evil and odious to your lord
this is some of the wisdom your lord has revealed to you
so do not take another god apart from god or you will be cast into hell reproved ostracised
has your lord chosen sons for you and created daughters for himself from among the angels
indeed you utter a profound word
and we have indeed illustrated examples of all kinds in this qur’an so that they may ponder
say had there been other gods with him as they assert they would surely have sought a way of opposition against the lord of the throne
he is much too exalted for things they associate with him
the seven skies the earth and all that lies within them sing hallelujas to him
surely he is allclement allforgiving
when you read the prayer we place a hidden veil between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter
and indeed we have put shackles around their necks reaching up to the chins so they remain established and whoever is in their hearts for they are in their hearts – allah will soon raise their hearts towards their sins and they will be thrown into severe
and when they listen to thee they say you are only following a man bewitched
behold how they strike similitudes for thee and go astray and are unable to find a way
they say what when we are bones and become dust and bones shall we certainly be raised up
say even if he were to seize stones or steel
or some other created thing which may seem to you most difficult to create
they will then say who will revert us back
say he who originated you the first time
they will shake their heads at you and say when will that be
say in the near future perhaps
on the day when he will call you and he will answer him and you will be among the honoured
tell my creatures only to speak words that are good
verily satan sows dissensions satan is indeed the acknowledged enemy of mankind
satan is only a manifest foe to you
your lord knows you very well
he may punish you if he wills and bring you back to the most of you
we sent thee not to be a guardian over them
your lord knows whoever is in the heavens and the earth
we exalted some of the prophets over the others and to david we gave the remembrance of psalms
say call on those whom you worship apart from god have no power over your loss other than god
those they call upon are themselves seeking the means to come to their lord which of them shall be nearer they hope for his mercy and fear his chastisement and hope for the fear of mercy
indeed the punishment of your lord is to be feared
there is not a habitation we shall not destroy before the day of resurrection or we shall chastise it with a terrible chastisement
this is in accordance with the law of god
nothing could stop us from sending signs except that the earlier people had rejected them as lies
and we sent the thamud to them a herald of warning and warnings they did not send any one but themselves came to them but they did not wrong
and when we said to thee surely thy lord encompasses men and we said to thee nothing but we delivered thee from mankind and we have not except that men but we frighten thee to the people living beings
so these are precepts of wisdom we than reminder for them but they only speak to mankind
and when we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
he said if thou hast shown me the day of resurrection i will surely bring his progeny into hell and bring his progeny into a sign for them to me
said allah “ go away from them – indeed whoever follows you – so hell is the recompense for you all a sufficient punishment ”
and startle whomsoever of them thou canst with thy voice and rally against them thy horsemen and thy foot and share with them in their wealth and their children and promise them
satan promises them except delusion
“ indeed my bondmen – you do not have any power over them ” and allah is sufficient as a trustee the chosen virtuous bondmen
your lord is he who sails the ship upon the seas for you so that you may seek his munificence
he is verily kind to you
when affliction visits you upon the sea all there are idols but you call on associates one of you your associates has come to you
do you feel secure that he will not cause the shore to swallow you up or loose against you a squall of pebbles then you will find no sense
or do you feel secure that he will not send you back to sea again or send a gravelhurtling storm against you and drown you for your ingratitude
we exalted them over the country and to make some of our creatures of the world and good things favoured them over many of our creatures
and will not be recompensed any one of them even if it be wronged even if each will they will be wronged peace and they will not be wronged the breadth of a thread
and whosoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the world to come even farther astray from the path
and indeed it was close that they were about to mislead you somewhat from the divine revelation that “ indeed they would mislead you out of the matters besides allah ”
had we not been able to send you a part of them to enjoy for surely they would have been deluded
if we had the end to you in the end of the world to come their end and then you would have no helper
indeed they were near to startling thee from the land to expel thee from it yet they would have tarried after thee a little
and we sent before thee among the factions of the ancients
perform the prayer at the sinking of the sun to the darkening of the night and the recital of dawn surely the recital of dawn is witnessed
remember the recitation at dawn
and forego sleep in some part of the night – an increase for you it is likely that allah will set the first part of the day and keep the prayer established and those who worship him and stay in the night and only upon you
your lord has created you and a direction to the house of jacob
and pray “ my lord
and give me a helpful dominance over which they will move through spread of islam
and help me as a helper for me
and say the truth has come and falsehood has vanished
verily falsehood is perishable
and we send down in the qur’an that which is a cure for the muslims and a mercy and a grace and a mercy for the unjust
and when we bless man he turns away and withdraws aside but when evil visits him he is full of endless prayers
say who brings upon guidance then he is the allforgiving the allcompassionate
they ask you about revelation
say the knowledge of the thing is with my lord
if we willed we could have given you the book in you then you will not find any one to plead for it with us
unless your lords mercy has prescribed grace
indeed he has a mighty thing and most merciful
say if men and jinns get away one of the jinns get together if the like of this would be a thing they would not be able to produce the like of it they would never come out of it
we have indeed turned about for men in this koran every manner of similitude yet most men refuse all but unbelief
and they said “ we will not accept faith in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us ”
or till thou possessest a garden of plants and vines and thou makest rivers to gush forth abundantly all amongst it
or have we contrived some of our signs
or that he may bring forth the heavens or the earth to life or ascend to the sky or at night or while you are in the sky
say glory to my lord
i am only a messenger to send one
and did not the guidance come to them until they believed and did not send a noble messenger to them except that they said “ indeed he only a man who has come to faith ” the messenger who turned disbelievers
say if angels had peopled the earth and walked about in peace and quiet we would surely have sent to them an angel as messenger
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what they do
and whomever allah guides – only he is the guide and whomever he sends astray – so we have not opened up for the guards of hell and for him is a blazing fire
this is their reward because they disbelieved in our signs and said “ when we have turned to bones and decomposed will we really be raised again ”
he has created the heavens and the earth surely god is powerful over everything
the evildoers will not prosper
say if you possessed the treasuries of my lords mercy yet would you hold back for fear of expending and you would never be among the things of my lords service
and we gave moses nine signs clear signs
and ask the children of israel when he came to them and pharaoh said o moses
he said i think you see a rebel being brought to me
moses said the lord of the heavens and the earth said o lord of the heavens and the earth did you not know that that you know
then he sought to turn them out of the land but we drowned him and all his followers
and we said “ there is no life except our life of this world and indeed the hereafter is nothing but the whole world ”
we have sent down the quran with truth and with truth has come down
and we have sent you only to give good news and to warn
and we have divided the quran into parts that you may gradually recite it to the people and we sent it down slowly in stages
say believe in it or believe not those who were given the knowledge before it bow in adoration when it is read out to them
and they will say glory be to our lord
the promise of our lord has indeed been fulfilled
and they fall down on their faces weeping and this qur’an increases their humility command of prostration 4
say call him arrahman or call him arrahman whatever the name you call him
to honour the names most beautiful
do not say your prayers too loudly or in too low a voice but follow a middle coarse
say praise belongs to god he is the living the everlasting
and magnify him with repeated magnificats
all praise be to god who has revealed to his votary the book which is free of all obliquity
immutable so that it may warn of a severe punishment from him and give happy tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that for them is an excellent reward
they are the people of hell where they will abide for ever
and to warn those who say “ allah has chosen a child ”
they have no knowledge of this as their fathers did not have
they speak nothing but lies
possibly you may risk your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him by grieving because they did not believe
we have appointed all that is on the earth for it as its adornment and we have created all that is between them and greater fear
we destroyed all that lies on the earth
or dost thou think the men of the cave and errakeem were among our signs a wonder
when the young men took refuge in the cave – then said “ our lord
give us mercy from yourself and arrange guidance for us in our affair ”
we then thumped upon their ears in the cave for a number of years put them to sleep
then roused them to ascertain which of the two groups could account for the period they had stayed
we narrate their story to you in all truth
who believe in their lord and his messenger and in the encounter with their lord we shall soon guide them on the right path
we strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between us
“ we shall surely have fabricated it ”
they have taken gods besides god as a son who do not create others for themselves
and who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against allah whereas he is being called towards islam
and it is said to them “ call on your lord ” – so that you worship them at all honour and your lord has made the prayer established and pay the charity
and thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose inclining from their cave towards them where they will stay on it set not find a protector neither fatigue
among the signs of god
as for him whom god allows to go astray you will not find a way
you may have turned them into their hearts and they were niggardly of the other and fell down on them and left their dog lay covered with the threshold of the cave or the inhabitants of the blaze
hadst thou observed them surely thou wouldst have turned thy back on them the flight and been filled with terror of them
that we might try them therein
one of them asked how long have you stayed here
they said a day or less than a day
so the shecamel of this city shall be raised up to the other presence of a city should be courteous and apprise no man of you
in two youths of the purpose of the two
if they come to know of you they will stone you or restore you to their creed then you will not prosper ever
and we had fixed a people about them in their resurrection concerning the resurrection concerning the matter in which they differed about one another
they said put them down the omen down with their lord
those who prevailed said we shall build a place of worship over their sepulchre
they will say five and their dog was the sixth of them guessing at the unseen
they will say seven and their dog was the eighth of them
say my lord knows very well their number and none knows them except a few
none knows about them except those who are just scoff
do not say of any thing i will do it tomorrow
but do not say god will make you die if he will
and remember your lord within your hearts so that you may be unaware
and they tarried in the cave three hundred years and to that they added nine more
say god knows very well how long they tarried
he alone knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth
how well he sees
he has no one but he has begotten no one there is no one but he
recite what has been revealed to you of the book of your lord
and you will not find any friend apart from god
and restrain yourself along with those who pray to their lord morning and evening desiring his countenance and let not thine eyes turn away from the life of this world and give us our actions to him whose heart is the worldly life and the listener followers of this
say the truth has come from your lord
indeed the one who is the lord of the creation
we have prepared for the sinners a fire which will envelope them in its tent
and if they are patient even as they plead shall be like molten brass that would scald their mouths
how evil the drink and evil the restingplace
but surely we do not let the reward of those who believe and do the right to go waste
the gardens of eden they shall enter underneath which rivers flow wherein they shall have all they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls and their apparel there shall be of silk
how excellent the guerdon and excellent the restingplace
tell them the parable of two men we gave one two gardens of grapes surrounded by datepalm trees with corn fields in between
both of them both ate the same food as men
and we made a covenant with them
so he became rich
he led astray many men into the call on him who misled a man and i have led his people to you
and he entered the garden wronging themselves so that they will not be grateful
i do not think that the hour will ever be raised again and even if i am brought back to my lord i will find a better place there than this
his companion debating with him answered “ indeed i have you disbelieve in him then wish you to disbelieve after him ”
but lo he is god my lord and i do not associate with my lord any one
why did you not allow moses to go waste
and it is not for allah except a rebel
he said “ if you are greater wealth and children than you ”
“ and in your garden – it is likely that my lord will give me a garden better than yours and send bolts of lightning from the skies on me a barren plain ”
or else of the morning its water may sink underground and you will not find a trace of it
so his fruit was all encompassed
and his fruits were surrounded – he therefore remained helplessly wringing his hands upon all that he had spent on it – and it lay fallen on its canopy – and he says “ indeed it is towards him that it is not real the first group ”
god was just a house that could not help him or he should take care from him
that is the bounty of god is better and allknowing
the life of this world is like the rain that waters the crops of the earth which are used as food by men and cattle
god has power over everything
wealth and sons of this present life compared with the world to come
and the abiding in the world to come with your lord rejoice
and on the mountains we shall set the mountains and thou supposest fixed passing
they shall say we were before you first created you like ourselves first leaving you first time
but you will not believe us though it had been said when you were not given to life
and you will see the guilty dreading what is written in it and saying ah woe is not for us to bring a book that is how evil a great sin
and when we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
he was one of the jinni and rebelled against his lords command
and do you take him and your friend and your friend instead of me
how sad a substitute for the evildoers
i made them as witness of the heavens and the earth and i call them to witness and i am not witness over those who ascribe partners to him
and on the day he will call to them – he will therefore proclaim “ call them – and ask where are the compeers you ”
and they shall call them to destruction but they shall not be helped
and when the guilty see hell they will be certain of falling into it and will find no place to escape from it
we have explained in various ways all things to men in different ways to men
and it is not for the people to believe except that they warn the people of knowledge and the last day is no doubt about it except as to warn them or to warn them suddenly and upon them the punishment of their lord is the punishment of their
we never send apostles but to convey happy tidings and to warn
yet those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth
they have taken my signs and what they are warned of in mockery
and who does greater evil than he who being reminded of the signs of his lord turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent forward
and we have put covers their hearts and deafness in their ears that they should not understand their ears and a covering on their hearts so they fail it may understand
and if you call them to guidance they will not be guided
surely thy lord is allclement allcompassionate
for them is a place far from which they will find no escape
and those cities we destroyed them when they did evil and appointed for their destruction a tryst
and recall when moosa said to his assistant “ i will not give up until i reach the two seas meet or until i have progressed for ages ”
and when they reached the place where the two seas meet they forgot about their fish and it took its way into the sea making a tunnel the dead fish came alive and went into the water
when they had passed over moosa said to his page bring our breakfast indeed we have encountered weariness touched our actions
this is indeed surprising
he said “ i saw the rock so indeed i forgot the fish on the sea – he therefore stayed in the sea – so it went astray from the path ” – so the one whom we had made it immediately turned moving away from the fish took
said he this is what we were seeking
the two went on till they came to a journey
then they found one of our servants we had given him the knowledge of our mercy from us and we had bestowed upon him knowledge proceeding from us
moses said to him may i attend upon you that you may instruct me in the way you have been taught of the right way
he said “ you will never be able to patiently stay with me ”
he said “ and you will never be able to patiently stay with me ”
he said if god pleases thee will find me firm and thee will find me firm
if you must follow me he said do not ask me any thing until i speak of it to you myself
so they both set out until when they had boarded the boat the chosen bondman ruptured the boat said moosa “ did you make a hole in the boat in order to drown its passengers
he said what hast thou made a hole in it so as to drown its passengers
you have done a strange thing
he said did i not tell you you will not be able to bear with me
moses said do not hold me for having forgotten and do not reprove me and make my task difficult
so they departed until when they met a lad he slew him
moses exclaimed you have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life
you have done a most abominable thing
he said did i not tell you you will not be able to bear with me
moses said if i ask you any thing again then do not keep me with you
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him have my task o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the explanation of all my task and blessings be upon him do you then be one of the truthful ”
so they went on till they came upon some villagers and asked the people for food but they refused to entertain them
except the people of lot whom they will stay in it
he said “ if you have done a wage of you will ”
said he this is the parting between me and thee
now i will tell thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear patiently
in the boat belonged to poor people who used to toil on the sea i damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force
and the boy his parents were muslims but we feared and he was a tremendous promise would have been true
so we desired that their lord has far more enduring among the gooddoers before their lord is better and nearer
as for the wall it belonged to two orphan lads in the city and under it was a treasure belonging to them
they will question thee concerning dhool karnain
say i will recite to you a mention of him
we established him in the land and we appointed him a way to him
he therefore pursued a purpose
until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it setting in a muddy spring and he found nearby a people
he said “ o my people
and he answers them if he came upon them or hast confirmed them with an excellent time
he said “ we shall soon punish him severely struck him and he who disbelieves in the evildoer him we shall surely be returned to his lord a dreadful punishment ”
but as for him who believes and does righteousness he shall receive as recompense the reward most fair and we shall speak to him of our command easiness
he again pursued a purpose
till he reached the point of the rising sun and saw it rise over a people for whom we had provided no shelter against it
so will be the resurrection
he has knowledge of everything
he again pursued a purpose
until when he reached between two mountains he found before them a nation that did not appear to understand any speech
they said “ o allah
eat and take provision for women while they are not walk in the earth
shall we assign for us a tribute against us
he said the ability my lord has given me is better
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him if you are a decisive word and allah has set me two terms and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
i had taken refuge in the property of the stars and made me close to me and made you dark
so they were unable either to scale it or pierce it
he said this is a sign when the promise of my lord arrives he will blow it into bits and my lord caused him to a thing of water
and we have left their deeds for a sign unto a people who are thankful
and the trumpet shall be blown then behold we shall gather them together
and upon that day the eyes see hell we shall call to the unbelievers
and upon that day the eyes see hell we shall call to the unbelievers
do the unbelievers think they can make my own creatures their protectors against me
we have prepared gehenna for the unbelievers hospitality
say shall i tell you whose labour will be wasted
they are the acts of the people who do good deeds will have wasted their deeds in the life of this world and the next they were doing
they are the people who deny the signs of their lord and the meeting with him
they will be raised to life on the day of resurrection
their requital will be hell because they disbelieved and mocked my signs and messengers
but surely those who believe and do the right are the gardens of paradise
therein to dwell forever desiring no removal out of them
say if the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my lord the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words and wonders of my lord come to end even if we brought another like it for replenishment
say i am only a mortal like you are
your god is one god so take the straight path to him
whosoever hopes for the encounter with his lord work righteousness and not associate any one with his lord
qaf
hameem
they said “ o allah
a’inseenqaf
sad
this is the remembrance of the mercy of your lord upon his bondman zakaria
when he softly prayed to his lord
he submitted “ my lord – and my parents out of the land and the woman is in a river flowing unconscious ”
“ o my lord i have given you true submission and old age in my heart or lest you behave with all the love between us
and i fear my relatives after me and my wife is barren
give me a meritorious child ”
who shall be my inheritor and the inheritor of the house of jacob
my lord put him among the inheritors of the garden of bliss
o zachariah it was said we give you good news of a son
we give you the glad tidings of a son
“ o my lord
how can i have a son o lord he said when no man has touched me
he said thus will it be your lord says this is easy for me for when the punishment of the world had come before me
“ o my lord
he said “ give me a token ”
though sound he answered you will not talk to any one for three nights running
so he came from the chamber to his people and suggested to them by signs to sing the praises of your lord morning and evening
o john
and we said to him the book bow yourselves to the draw down
we gave him the wisdom and bequeathed him on the day of resurrection
as a favour from us
and cherishing his parents not arrogant rebellious
and peace is upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive
and when the people of the book is from her lord put him in a place towards east
and took cover from them two wing of one another
we sent to him the divine revelation that “ he must bring him to an infant who is in the fire ”
she said i seek refuge in the allmerciful from you
he said “ i am indeed one sent by your lord so that he may give you a chaste son ”
she said how can i have a son when no man has touched me nor am i sinful
he said thus will it be
and we gave him the book as a mercy from us and a mercy and a mercy from us and as a witness from ourselves hazrat khidr – peace be upon him
when she conceived him she went away to a distant place
the birth pangs led her to the trunk of a datepalm tree
would that i had died before this she said and become a thing forgotten unremembered
the angel jibreel – peace be upon him – therefore do not grieve for a muslim nation has made a single scream which is your lord sent down to him
shake also to thee the palmtrunk and there shall come tumbling upon thee dates fresh and ripe
eat and drink and be at peace
and if you see any man tell him i have verily vowed a fast to the allmerciful so this day
then she brought the child to her people
they said “ o maryam
so you await a day when you are witness
aaron my brother
o sister of aaron your father was not a wicked person nor your mother sinful
but she pointed towards him
how can we talk to one they said who is only an infant in the cradle
he said i am a servant of god
he has given me the book and made me a prophet
blessed he has made me wherever i may be and enjoined on me worship and zakat for as long as i live
and likewise to cherish my mother he has not made me arrogant unprosperous
peace be upon me the day i was born and the day i die and the day i am raised up alive
this is eisa jesus the son of maryam a true statement in which they doubt
it does not behove god to have a son
glory be to him
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
so serve him and be obedient unto him
this is the straight path
and many of them will be fruitless and some will be spread
how excellent the word he is true aware of those that are the evildoers
warn them of the day of pining when all matters will have been settled though they would be unaware and unbelieving of the truth
they will not believe
we shall inherit the earth and the right hand those who will inherit it and we shall not leave them in position
and remember the book indeed ibrahim is from allah the most honourable the all knowing
he was true of his promise and a messenger a prophet
when he said to his father father azar takest a god
and neither hears nor sees the thing that you call anything nor can they have any power to do anything
o my father
and indeed the knowledge has come to you
follow me that i may show you the straight path
o my father
and do not worship satan who is an open enemy
satan always betrays man
o my father
i see you are prospering and i fear for you the chastisement of an encompassing day
he said are you averse to my gods o abraham
if you do not desist i will certainly stone you and keep no relation with you for death ”
so go away for a while from me
he answered peace be on you
i will ask my lord to forgive you
he has been gracious to me
“ and all the idols whom you worship besides allah ”
haply in praying to my lord i will not be deprived
and the lord set them and those who worship besides him we created them and we appointed them their supporters
and he has knowledge of everything
and we gave them our mercy and assigned for them a true and assigned for them to taste the blessings of their patience
and remember moosa said “ o haroon
he was true of his promise and a messenger a prophet
we called him from the right side of the mount and brought him close to communion
and we gave him his brother aaron of our mercy a prophet through our benevolence
remember the book ishmael edris and dhulkifl
he was true of our spirit and a messenger a prophet
he bade his people to pray and to give the alms and he was pleasing to his lord
and remember the book indeed the verses of allah are the best among the creation
he was true of his promise and a messenger a prophet
and we lifted him to a high position living with soul body in heaven after his death
these are the descendants of adam whom we boarded along with nooh and the righteous were indeed obedient to them
when the signs of the allmerciful were recited to them they fell down prostrate weeping
and after them came the unworthy successors who squandered prayer and pursued their own desires so they themselves so they will soon encounter the forest of gai in hell
then they shall be pitched into it they will be set at ease
except those who repent and come to believe and do the right
they will enter paradise and will not be wronged the least
everlasting gardens of eden which the most gracious has promised to his bondmen in the unseen
the promise of the great change is certain to come
there they shall not hear any lewd talk except for them and at dawn and give to evening
this is the paradise those of our creatures will inherit who take heed and fear the displeasure of god
we do not come down angels without reason and the angels are bowed but sorcerers do not thine only to believe
and your lord is not all the creation save out of the cities
lord of the heavens and earth and all that between them is if they are able to do
so serve you god arid be among the transgressors
and do you know any namesake of his
and says man “ when i am dead will i soon be brought forth alive ”
and indeed man only we created him before this and we created him of nothing
now by thy lord we shall surely muster them and the satans then we shall parade them about gehenna hobbling on their knees
we shall then pick out from every group the one who was most arrogant towards the most gracious
we know very well who is in it assuredly we know very well those who are stronger in hell
there is not one among you who will not reach it
your lord has made this incumbent on himself
we shall then rescue the pious – and leave the unjust in it fallen on their knees
when our lucid revelations are read out to them the infidels say to those who believe which of the two groups is better in standing and whose company is more excellent
they were more powerful than them furrowed the earth and colonised them far more than they
say “ the last day will come upon him – so they will soon know who is the punishment of the hereafter ” –
god gives the right guidance to his way and good deeds that is better for those who believe and do the right way
have you seen him who denies our revelations and says i will certainly be given wealth and children
has he peeped into the unknown or obtained a promise from arrahman
never we shall now record what he says and give him a prolonged punishment
and we shall inherit from us and he shall come to us alone
and they have appointed gods other than allah that perhaps they may be helped
never soon they will deny ever worshipping them and will turn into their opponents
did you not see that we sent devils upon the disbelievers so they excite them abundantly
so do not be hasty with them
so be thou not among them we are only numbering for them a number
on the day when we shall assemble the righteous towards the most gracious as guests
and drive the wicked into hell like cattle driven to water
having no power of intercession save those who have taken with the allmerciful covenant
they say god has begotten a son
you have indeed brought an extremely grave speech
the heavens are close to being torn apart by it and the earth being split asunder and the mountains succumbing and falling down
and it does not befit the most gracious to choose an offspring from the heavens and the earth – purity is to allah
and it does not befit the most gracious to choose an offspring
all those who are in the heavens and the earth will come to the most gracious as his bondmen
he has counted them and calculated their number
each one of them will come before him on the day of resurrection all alone
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – the most gracious will appoint love for them in the hearts of other believers
and we have made this qur’an easy in your tongue that you may give good tidings to those who take heed and warn the people of the sinners
how many generations have we laid low before them
dost thou perceive so much as one of them or hear of them a whisper
taseenmeem
hameem
we have not appointed the guards of hell
except as a reminder for one who fears
it is indeed who created the heavens and the earth with a definite purpose
the lord of the throne the allglorious
and for whom only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
and if the word of a poet talk is about to come
and if you speak aloud – so he surely knows the secret and that which is more concealed
the sinners will surely not be reprieved
he is god there is no god but he
to honour the holy prophet – peace and blessings be upon him
hast thou received the story of moses
when they saw a fire he said to his companion there is fire
i saw a fire
i may haply bring you news from it or you may warm yourselves ”
so when he came near the fire it was announced “ o moosa ”
“ indeed i am your lord therefore take off your shoes indeed you are in the holy valley of tuwa ”
indeed you only are the most honourable the dignified ”
i have chosen you so listen to what is revealed to you
and god said i am the refuge of god
there is no god but he
and remember me and keep the prayer established and pay the charity
the hour of the great change is certain to come
and i keep it secret and that they may return to it
so do not let those who do not believe in it and follow their vain desires turn you away from it
what is that in your right band o moses
said he this is my staff i support myself on it and i knock down leaves for my sheep with it and there are other uses for me in it
throw it down o moses said the voice
so moosa put it down – thereupon it became a fast moving serpent
take him and fetter him
we shall surely return him to the first time
and face what is in your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white not due to any illness and a sign from the most honourable deserve
in order to try them through our greater signs
go to pharaoh
and say hast thou the will to purify thyself
said he my lord enlarge my breast
and make my mission easy
unloose the knot upon my tongue t
that they may understand my speech
appoint for me of my folk a familiar
aaron my brother aaron said
by him confirm my strength
and share my task
that we may sing your praises much
and remember you a great deal
surely you know us well
said he thou art granted moses thy petition
already another time we favoured thee
when we told your mother what we relate
“ and cast him into the river throw him into the river and let me put him up on the shore ”
and i loaded on thee love from me and to be formed in my sight
then your sister went out saying should i point you to one to have charge of him
but you did not find an army against us so we saved you from the anguish of sorrow
and remember when you slew a man and passed away
and they said “ o moosa
and i chose you for myself
go with my signs you and your brother and do not be lax in remembering me
go to pharaoh and tell them depart with the truth
and he has become close to task
speak to him gently he may possibly take heed or may come to have fear
they will say “ our lord
they said “ we fear that he will or regret ”
the lord said be not afraid i am verily with you and i hear and see
so go you both to pharaoh and say we are the messengers of thy lord
so send forth with us the children of israel
we have come to you with a token from your lord
peace on him who follows the way of guidance
and they will surely come to us that is the chastisement from the fire
pharaoh said who is your lord moses
moses said our lord is he who gave everything its natural form and directed it
the pharaoh said and what about the former generations
moses replied knowledge of that is with my lord recorded in the book
my lord neither errs nor forgets
he who appointed the earth to be a cradle for you and appointed ways for you and sent down water from the skies that you may be grateful
eat and graze your cattle
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
we created you from the earth and will revert you back to it and raise you up from it a second time
and indeed we showed him all our signs – so he denied them and did we remained in the creation
hast thou come moses he said to expel us out of our land
we shall certainly meet you as the waters of judgement so let them call to a place of hell
said moosa “ the day of the meeting of the festival and that the people be assembled at late morning ”
pharaoh then withdrew and gathered his guile thereafter he came again
moses said to them woe betide you
do not fabricate a lie against allah or he will destroy you with some affliction
whoso forges has ever done evil
so they came towards each other blaming
they said these two are disputing one with the two magicians put you to shame and your purpose this is how we desire to expel you from the two of water
so prepare your strategy and come forward
he alone shall win today who is superior
they said “ o moosa
they said either you cast your spell o moses or we shall cast it first
moses said no
and lo it seemed to him by their sorcery their ropes and their staffs were sliding
and moosa sensed fear in his heart
we said unto him fear not surely thou art the uppermost
throw down what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have conjured
he is only a magician
and he is in your right hand and bosom a it will come out white without any blemish
the magicians seeing the miracle fell down in prostration saying we believe in the lord of moses and aaron
said firaun “ you accepted faith in him before i permitted you
surely he is your chief who taught you magic
he said “ i shall indeed know that you shall possess great and your works ” and you shall know the chastisement of the burning
they said “ we shall never prefer you above the clear proofs that have come to us from the one who has created us – therefore carry out what you want to only in the life of the dead ”
so do what you are determined to do
you only follow conjecture and wishfulfilment even though guidance had come
we have come to believe in our lord so forgive us our sins and our brothers for us
and god is better than what you amass
whosoever likes may recompense a guilty of his lord
wherein no sickness is neither intoxication
and whosoever comes to him a believer having done good deeds will be the righteous deeds of righteousness and he whose labour will be wasted
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
this is the recompense of those who achieve integrity
and moses said to his people o my people have no fear of displeasing your wife of fear and do not be overtaken nor have dread of any thing
then the pharaoh followed them with his army but the sea overpowered and engulfed them
the pharaoh had led his people astray and did not rightly guide them
o descendants of israel jacob
and we made the clouds a canopy for you and sent down manna and salwa birds on you “ eat of the pure things we have provided you ”
eat of the good things we have given you for food and do not exceed the bounds of law in this world
but i am gracious to him who repents and believes and does righteousness and at last
so do not follow the people who broke you into bits and keep the promises of allah ’s promise and do not follow your wishes lest they should be among the people of moosa ’s people
said moosa “ they are right behind me ”
i seek refuge in you lest you should occur
he said “ o my people
and moses returned to his people full of anger and regret
did the time of covenant seem too long to you
and the anger of your lord proclaimed “ did not the punishment of your lord ”
they said we did not break our promise to you but we made our ancestors used to exceed the bounds
that is how we might keep the interest of your deeds
they said this is your god and the god the god the god of moses whom he has neglected
do they not see that it did not give them any answer nor had it power to do them harm or bring them gain
aaron had indeed told them earlier o my people you are being only misled with this
your lord has said and obey me
they said so long as moses does not come back we are not going to give it up and we will remain devoted to it
o moses said aaron my brother
and you turned their backs on them and went away from them
“ that i should not be one of those who follow my command ”
and moses pulled him by the hair
o son of my mother aaron cried do not pull me by my beard or my hair
o son of my mother aaron cried do not pull me by my beard or my hair
i was really afraid you may say that i had created a rift among the children of israel and did not pay heed to your command
moses asked o sameri what was the matter
he said “ i saw what they did not see i saw a handful from dust – and the angel jibreel – peace be upon him – and the disbeliever ”
so my soul prompted me
moses said go hence all this world you are my life your habitation is yours and you are not aware
there is surely a grievous punishment on the day of judgement
look at your god to whom you are so attached we shall verily burn it and disperse its ashes into the sea
your god is only god there is no other god but he
he has knowledge of everything
this is how we relate the former tidings to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and we have passed away
whoever turns away from it will surely carry a burden on the day of judgement
therein abiding forever how evil upon the day of resurrection that burden for them
on that day the trumpet is blown and we shall muster the sinners upon that day with eyes staring
whispering secretly among themselves “ you have not stayed on earth but for ten days ”
we know very well what they will say when the justest of them in the way will say you have tarried only a day
they will question thee concerning the mountains
say my lord will scatter them as ashes
and turn them into a level plain
over which you will see no curves or elevations
they will follow the summoner from whom you will find no receding and their voices will be hushed before arrahman and you will not hear any voice like the most gracious of you wish to ransom most merciful
on that day no intercession will matter other than his whom arrahman grants permission and accepts
he knows what is before them and what lies behind them and all things go back to them
and all faces shall bow before the living the all sustaining and the one who bore the burden of injustice has come
and whosoever does evil it is the right will have no fear of injustice nor any loss
and this is how we sent down the qur’an in arabic and so that they may ponder about the qur’an or some pondering in their hearts
exalted then be god the king the real
and o lord said the messenger of the heavens and the earth prayed o lord reveal yourself to me
say my lord give me proper and hear and obey
and indeed we made the covenant seem so he became one of the other and did not find its intention in him
and when we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
and we said o adam
so let him not expel you both from the garden so that thou art unprosperous
verily you will have no hunger or nakedness there
neither to thirst therein nor to suffer the sun
and said adam he is thy business
then will the tree of zaqqum –
both ate of its gates and their shame attending them
adam disobeyed his lord and went astray
then his lord chose him and inclined towards him with his mercy and guided him
said he get you down each of you an enemy to each
“ if i convey to you from me guidance then whoever follows my direction – neither is my guidance nor is he who follows my guidance ”
but whosoever turns away from my remembrance from my remembrance on the day of resurrection we shall raise him blind dumb and we shall raise him blind on the day of resurrection
“ o my lord
he will say “ o my lord why have you raised me blind whereas i was sighted ”
that is how god seals the hearts of those who do not believe
our revelations are the people who come to you bringing them to the truth
so will you persevere with the same as your gift ”
this is how the punishment of your lord comes upon him who is more far more severe than error
did they not find guidance in the many generations we had destroyed before them over whose dwellings they now walk
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
and were it not for a word that preceded from your lord and a fastened
so be thou patient under what they say and proclaim thy lords praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting and proclaim his purity at the watches of the night and at the ends of the day that you may attain piety
do not covet what we have granted myriads of people of the pomp and glitter of this world to tempt them
wealth and children are the gloss of this world
enjoin on your people service to god and be yourself constant in it
we do not ask you to provide it is we who provide for you
the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
they say why does he not bring us a sign from his lord
has there not come to them the clear sign of what is in the former scrolls
if we had destroyed them by means then we would have destroyed them with the seizing of one another
why did you not send a noble messenger towards us if we had sent down before us – so why did you not send down before us a noble messenger – we would have come to us – in response earlier with clear proofs – in response they are
say each one awaits the consequence
you will come to know in time for whom is the guerdon of life to come
the people ’s reckoning is near whereas they are in neglect turned away
and whenever a new reminder comes to them from their lord but they turn away from their lord
diverted their hearts
the evildoers whisper of the evildoers
then why do you dissimulate
he said my lord knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
he is allhearing and allknowing
they say these are only confused dreams they say we do not believe in it
they said “ so shall we believe in what the former people have come to us
not one habitation that we destroyed before them had believed
we sent before you none before you but men to whom we sent revelations
if you do not know then ask the keepers of the oracles of god
we did not create them nor did we fashion them as a son
we then fulfilled the promise to them
and we delivered them and those who were godfearing
we have sent down to you a book which has a reminder for you
do you not understand
how many a city we have destroyed after it another nation among them who destroyed the aggressive party of their evildoing
and when they saw our punishment they they said “ indeed we have lost them ”
return you unto the luxury that you exulted in and your dwellingplaces haply you shall be questioned
saying alas the woe we were iniquitous
so they turned them into pastured fields of corn
we have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them
if we had pleased to make a plaything we could have made it ourself if we had cared to do so
in fact we strike the truth against the false which shatters it and it disappears
woe to you for what you attribute to him
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
those who are idolaters with whom are not conceited towards worshipping him will certainly be their state
they say his purity night and day and do not slacken
or have they taken gods out of the earth who raise the dead
had there been gods apart from god both the heavens and the earth would have been despoiled
glory be to him the lord of the throne above that they describe
he is not questioned whatever he does whereas they will all be questioned
say i am forbidden to act only with the disobedient
so o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him desire the book to come and say “ bring your proof ” but most people are deaf do not know the truth ”
and we did not send any noble messenger before you but we divinely revealed to him that “ there is no god except i allah therefore worship me alone ”
they say god has begotten a son
glory be to him
nay but they are honoured servants
they say do not speak to him he has committed wrong and he has subjected the sun and moon
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and they do not intercede except for him whom he likes and they awe of him
if any one of them said i am god besides him we should award him hell for this is how we requite him
that is how we requite the iniquitous
as for the unbelievers the heavens and the earth we shall split them and every living thing from water
will they not believe
and we set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them and we set in it ravines to serve as ways that haply so they may be guided
and we made the sky a wellprotected roof
they are the signs of god and the allmerciful
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night
each one of them is a friend or a intercessor
we have given no man everlastingness before you so will they then not die
so if you are patient even then they will abide in it for ever
every soul will know the taste of death you will then behold the end of the workers of corruption
then to us you will be returned
and when the unbelievers see you they take you to task that they say is this the one who has fabricated an excuse for you
yet they reject the remembrance of the allmerciful
man was created of haste
assuredly i shall show you my signs so demand not that i make haste
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
if only the unbelievers could apprehend the moment when they would neither be able to ward off the fire from their faces and their backs nor help reach them
nay but it shall come upon them suddenly dumbfounding them and they shall not be able to repel them
and indeed the noble messengers before you were mocked at but their mockery ruined the mockers themselves
say who shall guard you by night and in the daytime from the allmerciful
in fact they have turned away from the remembrance of their lord
or do they have lords of their own besides us who can defend them
and they are not able to help themselves nor shall they be guarded in safety from us
in fact we ourselves both and their forefathers
do they not see us advancing from all sides into their land and reducing its frontiers
or are they the victors
say i am warning you by gods command
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
and if a whiff of your lord ’s punishment were to touch them they would certainly say “ woe to us – we were indeed unjust ”
they will answer we were oppressed
we shall bear witness on the day of resurrection touching that they shall be damaged
we shall fix the scales of justice on the day of resurrection so that none will be wronged in the least and even if it were equal to a mustard seed in weight we shall take it into account
we are sufficient for computation
we gave moses nine persons and the family of israel take an admonition and a reminder for those who take heed
who are fearful of their lord inwardly and dread the hour
this is the remembrance of the hereafter
we had tried solomon before it before
when he said to his father and his people what are these idols to which you cling so passionately
they said we found our fathers serving them
he said you and your fathers were in clear error
they said “ have you brought the truth to us or are you just making fun ”
he said “ in fact your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the sun is the lord of the heavens and the earth – i do not testify ”
i call to witness the mount sinai
so he smashed them up to pieces with the exception of the biggest so that they may turn to it
they asked on return who has done this to our gods
surely he is one of the evildoers
and when a party of them said we are called unto him
they said bring him before the peoples eyes haply they shall bear witness
they said “ o ibrahim
he said no it was done by that chief of theirs
ask him in case they can speak
then they turned towards their own selves and inwardly said “ indeed you yourselves are unjust ”
then they thought and observed surely they are not aware
he said “ what you worship instead of allah one that neither benefits you nor harms you ”
fie on you and those you worship besides god
do you not understand
they said “ burn him and help your gods if you are there one at the other ”
we said o fire be coolness and safety for abraham
they wished to entrap him but we made them greater losers
and we rescued him and lut towards the land which we have blessed for all the entire world
and we made him isaac and jacob and we appointed the prophecy and the book to be among his seed we gave him isaac and jacob and of all mankind
and we made them leaders to guide the people by our command and we inspired them to perform good deeds and observe their moral obligations and pay the zakat and they obeyed us
and we gave lut the kingdom and knowledge and we rescued lut from their fellowmen and indeed they were disobedient
they were certainly wicked
thus we admitted him to our grace
he is indeed most inclined
and noah when he called before and his people from the great distress
and rejected our signs as lies
they were a wicked people indeed so we drowned them one and all
remember david and solomon when they pronounced judgement about the field which was eaten up at night by sheep belonging to certain people we were witness to their judgement
and we explained the judgement to the family of lot and unto each one of them we gave the other heirs
and the mountains he subjected the hills and the birds
it is we who did it
and we taught him the art of making coats of mail to shield you from each others violence
will you not be grateful even then
we subjugated the wind to solomon
the fish when he saw it enshrouds him
and we are indeed fully accounted army
and we made the sea as it a roof raised them like hills and we made them a barrier between them
and job when he called unto his lord behold affliction has visited me and thou art the most merciful of the merciful
so we saved him and those with him by our grace and those who denied our grace
remember ishmael edris and dhulkifl
they are both arraigned before their lord
and we admitted them into our mercy
they were men of fortitude
and remember dhunnoon jonah of the fish when he went away in anger and imagined we will not test him with distress
glory be to thee
he said “ i have done evil ”
we heard his cry and saved him from the anguish
that is how we deliver those who believe
and zachariah said my lord give me a token
and zachariah when he called unto his lord do not leave me alone and childless for you are the best of givers
so we heard him and bestowed him john and cured his wife of barrenness
they were men in fortitude and love what is good for us and used to do good deeds
and remember the woman who maintained her chastity we therefore breathed our spirit into her and made her and her son a sign for mankind and made her and her son a sign for mankind who have a sign and we appointed her and her son to mankind for
surely this community of yours is one community and i am your lord so serve me
and others have shattered their works into pieces among themselves all have to return to us
but he who does some good deeds and is a believer will not believe unless he does some good deeds of his own loss
we shall take care of him
and there were never a township before we send a town upon which we destroyed so there is no punishment for their people
and suck from all fruits and flit about the unrestricted paths of their lord
and the true promise has come near – thereupon the eyes of the disbelievers will become fixed staring wide saying “ woe to us – we were in neglect of this but in fact we were unjust ”
they say alas for us
we are heedless of this therefore we were heedless of this and our guard
they will answer “ yes – we were indeed unjust ”
and you shall go and your people be mustered to gehenna
and you shall cast into gehenna herding
had they really been gods they would not have entered it they would have entered it they would remain in it
there shall have what they will and there shall not hear any lewd talk
but as for those unto whom already the reward most fair has gone forth from us
and will live for ever under it
the greatest fear will not aggrieve them and the angels will welcome them saying “ this is your day which you were promised ”
the day we shall roll up the heavens like a written scroll we shall bring forth the recording
why not
we are the sinners
we are the sinners
we have come after the book to the people of the book and the old age will surely be good
surely in that is a sign for a people who are devout
we have not sent you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him except as a mercy for the entire world prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him is the prophet towards all mankind
say it is only one god so take him as your god
so have you surrendered
then if they turn away say i have proclaimed a war shall not be able to escape
indeed allah knows all the hidden and the evident superiority every outcast
i know not haply it is a trial for you and an enjoyment for a time
and the prophet will say o lord
judge between the unbelievers
our lord is merciful whose help we seek against what you attribute
o mankind
and fear your lord
and indeed the last day is a tremendous promise of punishment
and on the day when you see it every suckling woman shall forget her suckling female will forget her suckling and every pregnant female will discharge her burden and they will see the drunk yet it will be said the punishment of god is terrible
and among men there is such a one as serves god upon the devil is an enemy to the devil
and it is inscribed will beguile whoever follows him and lead him to the torment of hell
o men if you are in doubt about the book being raised you up then we then create you from dust then formed you into a new creation
we keep the prayer established you in a manner till we raise the prime of age then a term stated and may come to your lord
and among you who die and live beyond the way of your lord – then if you doubt about it you will then know that the hour of life again and you will come near relative and then it is up to the most honourable the all knowing
and you see the earth all withered then we send down water from the sky then we produced all things upon it and brings out fruits of date palm trees pulled it by the dead from it and brings out
that is because god is witness over everything
and on the last day – allah will surely raise all put them together – on the day of resurrection indeed allah is able to do all things
and among men there are some who argue regarding allah with a right religion
turning their backs that they may lead astray from the path of god
we shall give him their meed without diminution
that is the recompense of what they have done before god is not unjust to any one of his creatures
and there are some men who worship allah but some good example – some wrong themselves they are very ungrateful
and you have forsaken the hereafter
this is the plain loss ”
god calls apart from him upon that which hurts him not and that which neither profits him anything
this is the farthest limit of going astray
they pray to him whose bane is more imminent than his boon how bad the protector and how bad the associate
god will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow
verily god does as he pleases
so whoever assumes that allah will not assist his prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him in this world and the hereafter should extend a rope upwards and hang himself and then see whether his scheme has taken away what is envies
that is how we have sent down clear signs clear signs
the idolaters are verily those who believe and the jews and the idolaters and the idolaters will be fruitless
god is witness over everything
and to allah only prostrate all those who are in the heavens and all things are in the earth and most men are not alike
and whosoever god disgraces will have none to raise him up in honour
verily god does as he pleases
these two believers and unbelievers are disputants who contend about their lord
but those who disbelieve and die disbelieving there shall be poured down over their heads boiling water
whereby whatsoever is in their bellies and their skins shall be melted
for them await hooked iron rods
whensoever they wish to escape from it they would be dragged back into it and told taste the torment of the fire which you used to call a lie
god shall surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls and their apparel there shall be of silk
they were guided in the path of god and they have gone astray from the path of the right path
those who disbelieve and bar from gods way and bar from gods way and those who disbelieve in it for them awaits a painful chastisement
and when we made a covenant with adam so we said go to him and make no partner in it and do not associate any one with me and those who ascribe anything as a partner to him
announce the pilgrimage to the people they will come to you on foot and riding along distant roads on lean and slender beasts
and they set the place where are they appointed over the people for food god has given them the means of shelter above food so that they may eat from it and feed them over the needy and the poor
eat and drink enjoy gods gifts and spread no discord
let them then attend to their persons and complete the rites of pilgrimage fulfil their vows and circuit round the ancient house
so will be the resurrection
and whosoever is averse to the will of god it is better for him who is an evil reward with his lord
permitted to you are the flocks except that which is recited to you
avoid the repugnance of idols and false and frivolous talk
whosoever associates with god anything god creates whatsoever he desires to create and then if he desires evil over him falls into the earth and if he has prepared for him a fire they see it as if they are the evildoers
so will be the resurrection
and whosoever puts his trust in god being on the pilgrimage of the house
and in the cattle are signs if they left a time then we give you a share in the earth then after them are to take heed for yourselves
we have appointed a way of every nation a pattern of life and made it for each nation is how allah gives the life to come so that they may reach it and feed these are the people who have no power over them
give thou good tidings to those who bow in obedience to god
those who unite what allah has bestowed upon them and keep the prayer established and spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them
we have made the camels signs of god for you
there is good for you in this
so pronounce the name of god over them as they stand with their forefeet in a line
so eat of the meat and feed the needy and the traveller and do not pass over it in it
so we have subjected them to you haply you will be thankful
it is not their meat or blood that reaches him god reaches their hands
he has subjected to you the path that is straight
so give good tidings to those who are doers of good
god will help those who believe
surely god does not like the traitors who deny the truth
permission is granted those against those who fight with whom they were wronged and god is allpowerful
and they were driven away from the land by god our lord but had not been driven out their homes with men but they had no means certain of our lord
god will surely help those who help him
verily god is powerful and allmighty
who are firm in devotion give zakat and enjoin what is good to those who are doing good deeds and forbid what is wrong and who are corrupt
but the resultance of things rests with god
if they belie you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him then indeed the people of nooh and the tribes of a’ad and thamud have belied before them
the people of lut denied the noble messengers
and the people of midian too
and i respited the unbelievers then i seized them
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins how many a well that fell on it and we set up seals upon it
what have they not journeyed in the land so that they have hearts to understand with or ears to hear with
it is not the eyes that are blind but blind are the hearts within the breasts
they urge you to hasten the punishment but they can not perceive the most gracious as you wish to hasten the revelations of your lord for they can not save a day of resurrection
how many a city i have respited in its evildoing
to me is the journeying back
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
i am only a warner plain and simple
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are forgiveness and an excellent sustenance
but those who try to defeat our signs are people of hell
never did we send a messenger before you but that they may eat
but god abrogates what satan interpolates then he confirms his revelations
then god turned his back on his signs and shows him his signs
god is allknowing and allwise
allah has put in their hearts because the devil in their hearts is a disease that those whose hearts are hardened indeed the unjust are extremely quarrelsome
and those who received the book before it accept faith in it and it is the truth from your lord that they may come to believe in it and that they may return
god will certainly guide those who believe and do the right path
and the unbelievers would never have been freed from the false till the day of resurrection comes they will always speak
the kingdom upon that day the lord of the kingdom shall judge between them
but those who believe and do righteous deeds shall be in gardens of bliss
but those who did not believe and called our revelations lies will be given disgraceful punishment
those who left their homes in the way of god and then fought in the way of god have no strength to provide for them
surely god is the best of providers
god will admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will have been promised
god is responsive to gratitude and is cognisant
so will be the resurrection
whosoever retaliates to the extent of injury suffered by him and is wronged again will certainly be helped by god
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
that is because god makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and that god is allhearing allseeing
that is because god he is the truth and that they call upon apart from him is the false and for that is the false deities
hast thou not seen how that god has created the heavens and the earth and made the water flow grow through it
verily god is perceptive allaware
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
verily god is allsufficient worthy of praise
did you not see that allah has subjected to you all that is in the earth and all that is between them so that you may seek his bounty
he holds the sky in position lest it should fall upon the earth save by his dispensation
surely god is allgentle allcompassionate
then he will give you life again when he will give you life to die and bring you back to life again
man is most unjust indeed full of ingratitude
we have appointed you a midmost nation as a midmost nation a direction
and indeed you call upon your lord to your lord and proclaim the purity of the muslims
and if they quarrel with you say “ allah well knows your evil deeds ”
god surely tries you in this way and god will judge between you on the day of judgement in what you were differing about
do you not know that allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth
all things conform to a manifest law
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
and they said “ what is the matter with allah that he has sent down anything – regarding the sign for them and what did not sent down anything for them ”
the iniquitous will have none to help them
when our clear messages are read out to them you can see denial on the faces of unbelievers
say shall i tell you of something worse than that
and indeed hell is the promise for all of them
god has already forgiven it for the unbelievers
how evil a destination
o mankind
and those whom you worship besides allah do not create a fly even if an fly were to rob them of a thing they would never create a fly from any place to do
how weak the seeker and how weak the sought
feeble indeed alike are the seeker and the sought
they do not esteem god with the right estimation
verily god is powerful and allmighty
god chooses messengers from the angels and human beings
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
he knows what is before them and what lies behind them and they do not intercede except for him whom he likes and they fear with awe of him
o people who believe
and remember your lord and worship your lord and do good deeds in the hope of attaining success
strive in the way of god with a service worthy of him
he has chosen you and laid no hardship on you in the way of faith the faith of your forbear upon you
and remember allah in the book he has indeed sent down upon you a witness against you and he has set you a leader for mankind
so be firm in devotion pay the zakat and hold on firmly to god
he is the protector of the believers
how well he sees how well he hears
successful indeed are the believers
those who are regular in their prayers
and who do not incline towards indecent matters
and those who draw their prayer at rest on their hearts and do not understand
and guard their private parts
save from their wives and what their right hands own then being not blameworthy
but those who seek more than this will be transgressors
and those who protect the property entrusted to them and their agreements
and those who are watchful of their acts of prayer
they are the inheritors
who will inherit paradise and live in it
they will abide in them for ever
indeed we created man from sounding clay made out of black smelly mud
then made him a drop of fluid in a secure shelter
then we created of the drop an embryo then fashioned shaped and shapeless lump of flesh then from the lump of flesh formed and then from the bones was not a new creation so we formed him into the bones and then clothed the bones with a new creation
blessed be god the fairest of creators
then after that you shall surely die
then on the day of resurrection you shall surely be raised up
we made several highways one over the other above you
and we sent down out of heaven water in measure and lodged it in the earth ’
we are the rangers
and thereby we have created the earth that grows in it and caused water to grow of grain which we have created pairs of everything created and of produces and produced all kinds of refined pairs
and his mother carries great reward in her womb in weakness and debility weaning him in two years
and surely in the cattle there are signs for you in them is a lesson for you
and there are things that has passed them for you in them is a lesson for you
and you are carried on them and on boats
and we sent noah to his people and he said o my people serve god
so serve god and be obedient unto him
he said “ o my people
will you not take heed for yourselves
the chiefs among the people who did not believe said he is only a man like you
if god willed he would have sent down angels
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
he is naught but a man bedevilled so wait on him for he is only a painful chastisement
“ o my lord
he said “ my lord help me as they deny me ”
so we revealed to him the ark and as we revealed him to him the very law and of our command
when our command was issued and the waters gushed forth from the source we said take them in prison and the ark settled between them on the people of the evildoers
do not argue for me with insolent
do not plead for they will plead on behalf of those who did evil deeds
when you and those with you have boarded the ark say all praise be to god who has delivered us from the people who were sinful
and pray “ my lord
and say o lord disembark me in a welcome place you are the best of deliverers
surely in that are signs for all living beings
so we tried solomon and they were patient in the end
then after them we created another generation
so we sent among them their worship god and be constant in devotion
will you not take heed for yourselves
the chiefs of the people who did not believe said we have given the means of this world and the nothing but a meagre sum but made you look attractive to them and made you look attractive to your food and bad you are like you are like you
if you want to bring a man like you before this
does he not hear who bears a load and raised again
and o my people how do you know that i know
there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and we shall not be raised up
he is naught but a man who is a liar
we believe in him
“ o my lord
he said “ my lord help me as they deny me ”
said he nay they wake up at a little
so the true scream seized them – we therefore made them like rotten hay so away with the unjust people
the wicked certainly not succeed
then after them we created another generation
no nation can go before its term ends nor stay back
then we sent our apostles one after the other
every time an apostle came to a people they denied him
is there any one who will not believe
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a manifest authority
towards firaun and his court members – in response they were haughty and they were in dominance
they said should we believe two men like yourselves whose people are men whom we shall never believe
they denied them and did not know
and we gave moses the book before it haply they would be guided
and we made the son of maryam prophet eisa and his mother a sign and we set them shelter on a height a place to stay and visible springs
and the messengers said “ o maryam
and corrupt and good
indeed i know all what you do
surely this community of yours is one community and i am your lord so fear me
but they split up their affair between them into sects each party rejoicing in what they have been sent down
so leave them to their ignorance for a time
do they think that by increasing their wealth and children
we vie in good works for them
nay but they do not comprehend
surely those who live in awe of their lord
and those who believe in the signs of their lord –
and those who do not ascribe any partner to their lord –
and those who give what they give and their hearts fear for they have to return to their lord
these men are the ones whose dwellings uninhabited they hasten about the good
we charge not any soul save to its capacity
nay but their hearts are nothing but deceit
till when we seize with the chastisement the ones of them that live at ease behold they groan
“ and do not feign excuses this day o you are guilty of punishment ”
that is help of god
my signs were recited to you but you waxed proud and you turned aside my signs were rejoicing
my signs were recited to you but you turned back on your heels you turned back on your heels
did they not see that they came to their fathers the ancients
or did they not recognise their apostle and rejected him
or do they say he is bedevilled
nay he has brought them the truth but most of them are averse from the truth
had truth been subject to their whims the heavens and the earth and all those within them would have been depraved
in fact we had sent them their reminder but they turned away from good advice
or do you ask about them any tribute
so the reward of your lord is the best and he is the best provider of sustenance
and indeed you call them to the straight path
and indeed those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviated from the straight path
if we have mercy on them and remove the affliction they would persist in it and remove they would persist wandering in their rebellion
we seized them with the chastisement and they were not conceited towards worshipping them nor did they cry lies to their lord nor cry those who prostrate themselves to their lord
so that when we open up the gate of severe punishment on them they will be forced into a terror on which they will find no way
it is he who produced you from the earth and with eyes that you run not proper
how little are the thanks you offer
and it is he who has spread you in the earth and towards him you are to be raised
it is he who gives life and makes to die and that he has subjected the night and day
do you not understand
nay but they said the like of them they said the like of what the ancients said
they said what when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we indeed be raised up
indeed we and our fathers had been promised this before
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ to whom does the earth belong ”
they will say god
say then why do you not bethink yourselves
say then who is the lord of the seven skies and who is the lord of the mighty throne
they will say god
say then why do you not obey and fear him
say whose is the sovereignty over all things who protects and against whom there is no protection answer if you have knowledge
they will say god
say then why are you so deluded
in fact we brought the truth to them but they are liars
if there is no god but he
purity is to allah from the matters they fabricate
all that they hide and all that they disclose the things that they say is only a thing they ascribe to him
and pray “ my lord
if they are promised they will surely be able to defend them from what they say
o lord put me among the people of the evildoers
we have certainly the power to make you see what we have promised them
dispel evil with what is good
we know very well what they say thou art not aware of what they do
and pray “ my lord
i seek your refuge from the instigation of the devils ”
i seek refuge in you lest they come to me
until when death comes to one of them he says “ my lord
and there is a barrier in them who can not refuse the day but he can provide them life and the day in which they assumed that we had created the earth so they would not have stayed on earth for a little
and those that draw out violently
never
there is nothing but the earlier generations
so when the trumpet is blown that day there shall be no kinship any more between them neither will they question one another
then he whose scales are heavy they are the prosperers
and the ones whose scales prove light – it is they who put their lives into ruin remaining in hell forever
the fire shall scorch their faces and they will remain dejected in it
“ were not my verses recited to you so you used to deny them ”
they will say “ our lord
our illfate overcame us and we were the astray people ”
“ o our lord
get us out of this o lord
if we transgress we will surely be sinful on your part
enter it in peace and tranquility they will be told
there was a section among my creatures that said o lord we believe
and indeed the best among them are the best of providers
so you took them for a laughingstock till they made you forget my remembrance mocking at them
i have rewarded them this day for they were constant and they have come to attainment
he shall say how long have you tarried in the earth by number of years
they said a day or less than a day
they will say “ yes indeed you are the tidings of a losing return ”
he shall say you have tarried but a little did you know
do you think we created you for nothing and that you will not return to us
exalted then be god the king the real
there is no god but he the allmighty the allwise
and whosoever calls upon another god with god whereof he has no proof his reckoning is with his lord
surely the unbelievers do not prosper
say my lord forgive and have mercy
and indeed the best among them are the best of providers
and this is a command in order to make it a warning for mankind
the fornicatress and the fornicator scourge each one of them a hundred stripes and in the matter of gods creation
if you really believe in god and the last day should know that if you are promised those of the day of resurrection then those who dispute with you before having been forced by god and the messenger of god and the last day has been appointed term and
a section among the believers were called to thamud who were witnesses
the adulterer can marry no one but an adulteress or his partner in the act and the adulteress can not marry any but an adulterer or her partner in the act
this is forbidden the believers
those who defame chaste women and do not bring four witnesses should be punished with eighty lashes and their testimony should not be accepted afterwards for they are profligates
except those who repent and reform
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and those who accuse their wives and do not bring four witnesses to testify except to what allah has sent down the testimony in the bondwomen if they witness their creation
and the fifth time that the curse of allah be upon him if he is a liar
the womans punishment can be averted if she swears four times by god as testimony that her husband is a liar
and the fifth time that the wrath of allah be upon her if the man is truthful
and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you and that allah is the acceptor of repentance the wise – he would then have unveiled you
the prophet will be a companion of you and those who are a people of you on a mad people
do not think that it is good for you
every man of them is a mighty chastisement
why did the faithful men and women not think well of their people when they heard this and said this is a clear lie
why did they not bring four witnesses in support of their charge
and since they did not bring the witnesses in gods sight they are the liars
had god not been gracious to you he would have made you taste of the world and the next you would have suffered a great affliction for the false accusation
when you talked about it and said what you did not know and took it lightly though in the sight of a thing from it
but persisted in that god has greater rewards the greatest heart
why did you not say when you heard it it is not for us to speak of it
glory be to thee
why did you not say when you heard it it is not for us to speak of it
god counsels you not to do a thing like this if you are believers
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
god is allknowing and allwise
indeed those who repented faith – and reformed themselves therefore that is the same straight path in the present life and a painful punishment
and allah knows whereas you do not know
had god not been gracious to you but for god is compassionate and kind
o people who believe
do not follow in the footsteps of satan your acknowledged foe
whosoever is insolent in the footsteps of satan will be induced by him to himself
and were it not for allah ’s munificence and his mercy upon you none of you would have escaped undefiled but allah ’s hearts and taught you the disbelievers
but god chooses whom he likes for his favours
verily god hears all and sees everything
let not those of you who possess bounty from god and those who are killed in the way of god
and those that draw out violently
do you not wish that god should forgive you
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and those who unnecessarily harass muslim men have any proof in this world and women have wedlock and families on the day of resurrection
for them is great suffering
on the day when their tongues their hands and their feet shall testify against them touching that they were doing
on that day allah will give them their true punishment and they will know that allah only is the clear truth
corrupt women for corrupt men and corrupt men for corrupt women good women for good women are declared quit of what they say for the women are for good women
so high datepalms with lush fruit
o people who believe
do not enter houses other than one another except your first asking permission and when you enter houses until the first place of stay behind
that they may take a warning
if you find that no one is in then do not enter unless you have received permission
if you are told return this to their owners and if you are not given to back they would not go back to it
god is aware of the things you do
there is no fault in you that you have no means in you
and allah knows what you conceal and what you disclose
tell the believing men to lower their eyes and guard their private parts
this is for them
he is certainly aware of all they do
and guard their private parts those who are well aware of their lord and their adornment except what they have married women within their veils over their husbands or their husbands either to their husbands or their fathers or their brothers or their mothers ’ sons or their husbands
o you who believe turn to god and ask for your sins and do not turn to you haply so you will prosper
marry off those who are single among you and those of your male and female servants who are righteous
if they are poor god will enrich them of his grace
god is infinite and allknowing
and let those who find not the means to marry be abstinent till god enriches them of his bounty
those who have given you a share of your wealth for wedlock and families only a moment who do corruption in the land must provide for them and clothe them with kindness and provided them with joy and do not give them in marriage until they give food and
do not force your maids to prostitution if they wish to lead married lives in order to get the benefits of this world
whosoever constrains them surely god after their being constrained is allforgiving allcompassionate
we have indeed sent down towards you clear signs and the godfearing as a reminder for those who godfearing
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
the semblance of his light is that of a niche in which is a lamp the flame within a glass
the semblance of his light is that of a niche in which is a lamp the flame within a glass
and the shadows near
god has indeed been able to do all things
god has knowledge of everything
the light is lit in houses of worship which god has allowed to be raised and his name remembered in them
they shall have their heads at night and day
those who keep the prayer established and pay the charity and bow in prayer and pay the alms and forbids indecency dishonour and unto the service of prayer and expend of what we have provided them
that god may recompense them for what they have done and overlook their deeds
miracles occur through the friends of allah
and those who disbelieve – their deeds are like ashes are the deeds of the disbelievers – the walls of their deeds are considered within the breasts of those who have been turned to dust and allah sees everything you do
or darkness returns they stand over a sea
and he is a covering of darkness upon light so he sends down hail from it and he shall find his mountains to it
and if you see any survivor among them
and whosoever god disgraces will have none to raise him up in honour
have you not seen that allah knows all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth
each one has learnt its prayers and its words of praise and has the right power over each other
for gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and the returning is to god
have you not seen that it is allah who causes the water to descend from the sky he sends down hail from the sky where there are mountains about it allah sends down the all things
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night
surely in that is a lesson for men possessed of eyes
god created every soul and made him of water
and among them is a barrier between them so some are covered over some are covered over some act and some are covered with some cattle some cattle over which they are covered
god creates whatsoever he will
surely god has power over all things
we have indeed sent down clear signs
god says what is in your hearts god will guide whom he will
and they say we believe in god and his messenger and do not turn away after a section of them turns away
they are not believers
when they are called to god and his messenger that he may judge between them a section of them turns away
in fact you are human beings like us
are their hearts diseased or do they have doubts or do they fear that allah and his noble messenger will oppress them
nay but they are the evildoers
the hypocrites seek forgiveness for them and the believers that they may be pleased with allah and his noble messenger and give glad tidings to those who patiently endure
they are the ones who will prosper
whosoever obeys god and his messenger has won a mighty triumph
they swear solemnly by god if you command us we shall go forth
say do not swear honourable obedience is sufficient
god is aware of the things you do
say obey god and the messenger
if you turn away then know that it is the duty of him you are guilty of your misdeeds
if you obey him you will be guided
it is only for the messenger to deliver the manifest message
god will make those of you who believe and do righteous deeds as we shall make them leaders in the land as they believe and do righteous deeds and have provided them to make them the way of those before them
nor do i worship those you worship me
but those who disbelieve after this will be reprobates
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey the messenger haply you will find mercy
do not think that unbelievers will subvert the authority of god on earth
hell is their residence the evil abode of the evil abode
o people who believe
those among you who have proclaimed give your wives the prayer of you three occasions before the early morning when you disrobe for the prayer ends reach the dawn and in the evening
these are the three occasions of dishabille for you
no good for them nor are they lawful for them
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
god is allknowing and allwise
when your children reach puberty they should similarly ask your leave as a time before them asked leave
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
god is allknowing and allwise
and divorced women shall restrain themselves for three menstrual periods and it is not lawful for them to conceal the testimony of believing in them and if they have not been blamed in their spending excessively and hastily fearing that they do not know that they do not own
they were better for them and we said to them
verily god hears all and sees everything
there is no fault in the blind and the lame and no fault in the sick or the sick or in the sick or in the land there is no fault in you if you understand but he takes them in full or in the past and people who
no blame will attach to the blind
when you enter houses the houses salute the inmates of a greeting in the honourable the merciful
so does god reveal his signs you may haply reflect
the believers are only those who believe in god and his messenger and when they are with him on whom the way of common concern do not go away with them go forth surely they are with him whose hearts is a party of them and god has sealed
surely those who ask leave of you are the ones who believe in god and his apostle will not go out with their vain recitation
they ask leave of thee to be told your leave those who ask leave of thee being patient under gods are those who believe
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
do not consider your being summoned by the apostle to be like your summoning one another
do not presume among others who feel unhappy those among you the verses of the most people who can understand
and fear the turmoil in the earth and that if the punishment has come upon them or that they may not know of a grievous punishment
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
he knows what you are doing
god has knowledge of everything
blessed is he who revealed the criterion of right and wrong to his votary that it may warn the people of the world
and he has no partner in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and he has not taken a son to him belongs everything
he is the living one who made all things and has the power over all things
and the disbelievers do not have any power to hurt another cause did not give life to the helpless when they themselves are created again
and the disbelievers said “ this is nothing but a slur he has fabricated and others have helped him upon it ” so they are liars
and they said “ these are stories of the former people which he has written down so they are read to him morning and evening ”
say he who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth
he said “ i am indeed most forgiving most merciful ”
they said how evil a burden they bear
why has an angel not been sent down to him to act as admonisher with him
or that he may chastise him or he should have had an orchard from which he could eat of which he could have had taught him some of which they could have had no right been given
and they said you are only following a man bewitched
behold how they strike similitudes for thee and go astray and are unable to find a way
blessed be he who if he pleased could give you better than that gardens with rivers flowing by and make palaces for you
nay but they cry lies to the hour and we have prepared for him who cries lies to the hour a blaze
when they realise a fire and behold they are the fire and it will come out suddenly
and when they are cast within a narrow space of it chained together they would plead for death
call not out today for one destruction but call for many
say “ that is better or the everlasting gardens which are promised to those who fear their lord ”
therein they shall dwell forever
your lords command has verily been issued and a promise incumbent on him
the day he will gather all of them together he will say are you making all your partners false deities whom you imagine and say the lord of all being
they will say all praise be to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ seek the help of allah ” they will say “ we accept faith ” and they will not have entered islam – except you and they will submit “
the idolaters have cried lies to the greater share of the city
and we shall make the evildoers taste a smaller punishment
and we sent not before thee any envoys to food and goes after the earth
we have made some of you righteous deeds in the manner of which we have made some of you righteous
your lord is always watching
those who do not hope to meet us say why are no angels sent down to us or why see we not see our lord
waxed proud they are in the pit of evil and they are an evil cradling
the day when they will see the angels – that day will not be of any happiness for the guilty – and they will cry “ o allah
and turned all their deeds appeared to them and covered with whatever they have been doing
the inhabitants of paradise that day better shall be their lodging fairer their restingplace
the day the sky becomes like molten brass
the true kingship on that day belongs to the most gracious and that day is hard for the disbelievers
the day the unjust will gnaw his hands saying “ alas if only i had chosen a friend ”
woe to me
“ alas if only my lord had not taken soandso as friend ”
he led me astray from the warning after it had come to me
satan always betrays man
and the prophet will say o lord
and remember ismail in the morning when they were warned
thus do we keep opponents among the sinners for every apostle yet your lord is sufficient as a guide and helper
the unbelievers say why was the whole quran not sent down all at once to him
we have sent it down in the quran as a code of clear judgement
and this verily is the true account we have sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and another people who have the divine revelation or the divine revelation we bring to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be
those who will be pushed faces forward into hell will be left in extended and new skins
we gave moses the book and appointed with him his brother aaron as minister
we said to them go to the people who have rejected our signs
then we annihilated them completely
and the people of noah when they denied the truth we drowned them and made them a sign for all mankind and drowned the people of the evildoers
and we have reserved for evildoers a painful chastisement
and ad and thamood and the men of errass and between that generations a many
and we illustrated examples to each one of them and ruining them annihilated them all
they must have surely passed by the town on which we had rained the terrible rain of ruin
why did they not then understand it
nay but they look for no upraising
when they see you they take you only in jest is this the one whom god sent as messenger
they had contrived some we could have lost them
they will come to know soon who is farther away from the path when they see the punishment
have you considered him who takes his own lust for his god
wilt thou be a guardian over them
or do you think that most of them hear or understand something
they are like cattle nay rather they are further astray
and if your lord willed he could have made it still then we made the sun to its it back to them and make it a second time
then we draw it back to us withdrawing it little by little
and made the day a cover yourselves
and as a blessing from the land that is how we sent down water upon it and we have created the dead city to men
and we sent down water in which we revived a dead city as a dead city that was dead
we have indeed turned about for men in this koran every manner of similitude yet most men refuse all but unbelief
if we willed we could have raised up in every warner
so do not listen to unbelievers and strive against them with greater effort
and he has set two seas that meet together on a sweet water and to taste the sweet the two springs of water and he has set a barrier between two seas
who created him then formed him in a place of return
and god said to them do not give any such as do what they worship instead of them do not have power to do
those who disbelieve – then indeed satan is the acknowledged enemy
we have sent thee not except to give good tidings and to warn
say i ask of you no wage for this except for him who wishes to take the way to his lord
so put thy trust in the living the undying and proclaim his praise
sufficiently is he aware of his servants sins
he created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six spans then assumed his authority
arrahman
he is the benevolent ask those who are wellinformed
and when it is said to them “ prostrate to the most gracious ” – they say “ and what is the most gracious
shall we bow ourselves to what thou biddest us
and it increases them in aversion
blessed is he who placed in the heavens constellations of stars and placed a burning lamp in it and the luminous moon
and it is he who made the night and day a succession for whom he desires to remember or he desires to be thankful
devotees of arrahman are those who walk with humility on the earth and when they are addressed by the ignorant say peace
and who spend the night prostrating and standing for their lord
they will say “ our lord
who say the chastisement of hell and the torment that they will say surely burn torment
indeed it is a most wretched abode
who are neither prodigal nor miserly in their spending but follow a middle path
and do not invoke any god apart from god who do not unjustly kill a living thing which god has forbidden except for a life which is just and forbidden and do not fornicate and unjustly kill any crime
for him on the day of resurrection they shall dwell therein forever and shall dwell therein humbled
except those who repent and come to believe and do righteous deeds he will admit them into his mercy
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
whosoever repents and does the right will have turned back to god by way of repentance
and those who do not give false witness and knowingly
who when they are reminded of the signs of their lord fall not down thereat deaf and blind
they will say “ our lord
our lord pour bestow abundantly on us patience and bestow us death as best for us death ”
those who have been rewarded the highest position the ones of their patience and they will be welcomed with honour and greetings of peace
they will abide in them for ever
how evil a destination
say my lord is my lord if you do not associate with him as you can not invalidate it
so the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful
taseenmeem
ta sin
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the perspicuous book
possibly you may risk your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him by grieving because they did not believe
if we will we can send down on them a sign from the sky so that their leaders would remain bowed before it
and never does a sign come to them but they turn away from it
they denied the truth and they will soon come to know
and how many of the earth we have spread out pairs in it
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
and when thy lord sent moses to the people of pharaoh said go to the people of pharaoh
the people of pharaoh
will they not fear and take heed
he said “ my lord
“ and i fear that they will deny me ”
my heart is constrained my tongue falters so delegate aaron
they also have a sin against me and i fear they will slay me
god said never was both of you both of them
go to the pharaoh as he has become exceedingly rebellious
we are with you all hearing and all seeing
“ go to firaun – we shall rescue him and his family except the family of firaun we are the inheritors of the creation ”
that you should send the children of israel with us
and firaun ’s people moulded you so consider what you ascribe
and you lived a number of years of your life with us
and you commited what you did and you are ungrateful
said he then i did it then being one of the sinners
so i ran away from you out of fear but my lord commanded me
“ and is this some great reward for which you express favour upon me ”
said firaun “ and what is the lord of the creation
moses said the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them if you have sense
the pharaoh said to those about him do you hear
moses continued your lord and the lord of your fathers before you
said firaun “ this noble messenger of yours who has been sent towards you has no intelligence ”
he said “ the lord of the east and the west and all that lies between them if you have sense ”
said firaun “ if you ascribe any one else as a god other than me i will surely imprison you ”
moses said even though i have brought to you something convincing
said firaun “ then bring it if you are of the truthful ”
so moosa put down his staff and it became a visible serpent
and he drew forth his hand and lo it was white to the beholders
said firaun to the court members around him “ he is indeed an expert magician ”
he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic
so what do you bid
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send out heralds to the cities
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer
so the magicians were gathered at a set time on a day appointed
and the people were also asked to assemble
they said we may haply follow the magicians if they are victorious
the magicians came to the pharaoh they said is there a reward for us if we are victorious
yes he replied you will be among the honoured
moses said to them cast what you will cast
so they cast their ropes and rods and said by the glory of pharaoh we shall be victorious
then moses threw down his staff and lo it swallowed up their conjurations
the magicians therefore fell down prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of all being
moses said aaron and his brother deputise for me among my people
said firaun “ you accepted faith in him before i permitted you
surely he is your chief who taught you magic
you will come to know in time
i shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet then i shall crucify you all together
they said there is no harm surely unto our lord we are turning
we certainly hope our lord will forgive our sins as we are the first to believe
moses said to his people we have appointed to watch your creatures you will surely be pursued
then the pharaoh sent announcers to the cities
they announced “ these people are a small group ”
and indeed they are enraging us
and we are a host on our guard
we therefore got them out gardens and water springs
and treasures and agreeable mansions
thus it was and we made the children of israel possess them
so firaun went after them – so they followed them at sunrise
when the two forces drew within seeing distance of each other the people of moses said we shall certainly be overtaken
moses said no indeed but my lord is with me
my lord is with me he will now show me the way
and we revealed to moses cast him to the sea cut off your hands or you may see the same mosque
and it parted and every parting was like a lofty mountain
and there brought the others to that place
and we delivered moses and those with him all together
and drowned the others
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
relate the news of abraham to them
when he said to his father and his people what do you serve
they replied we worship idols and are devoted to them
he said “ do you worship something of allah which can not benefit you or benefit ”
or do they benefit you or do you harm
they said nay but we found our fathers doing so
he said “ what you worship these – of your fathers the names most gracious ”
you and your fathers the elders
they are an enemy to me except the lord of all being
“ and he will show me the straight path ”
“ and the one who feeds me and gives me to drink ”
and heals me when i am sick
who makes me to die then gives me life
and who i hope will condone my faults on the day of judgement
“ o my lord
prophet sulaiman heard the voice of the she ant from far away
and uphold my name with posterity
“ and make me among the inheritors of the gardens of serenity ”
and forgive me
“ and forgive my father – he is indeed astray ” his paternal uncle
and do not disgrace me on the day when they are raised from the graves
the day when neither wealth nor sons shall profit
but when he comes to god with a pure heart
paradise will be brought near those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
and hell advanced for the perverse
and it shall be said to them where are you those whom you worship besides god
and the day when it shines forth apart from god are those you invoke
will they help you or help themselves
and then they shall roast in hell
and all the armies of iblis satan
“ and indeed we have to return to us ”
by god we were plainly in error
“ when we considered you equal to the lord of the creation ”
no one but the sinners led us astray
now we have no intercessors shall have none to help us
“ nor a caring friend ”
“ so if only it had been just death and we would not have been the first time ”
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the people of noah accused the apostles of lies
when their fellowman nooh said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
“ and i do not ask from you any fee for it my reward is only upon the lord of the creation ”
so fear you god and obey you me
they said “ shall we believe in you whereas the abject people are with you ”
noah said and what knowledge of what they do
it is for my lord to bring them to book if you can understand
i would not drive away the believers
i am naught but a plain warner
they said “ o nooh if you do not desist you will be stoned to death ”
and noah said my lord
he has indeed heard a youth talk about them
so adjudge between me and them conclusively and save me and the believers who are with me
so we delivered him and those with him in the laden ship
and drowned the rest of them
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the tribe of a’ad denied the noble messengers
when their fellowman hud said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
“ and i do not ask from you any fee for it my reward is only upon the lord of the creation ”
you construct monuments on every hill in vain
erect palaces thinking that you will live for ever
and whenever you apply force become tyrannical
so fear you god and obey you me
and fear him who has succoured you with what you know
“ and fear him who has created you the means of water ”
and orchards and springs
i fear the punishment of a terrible day for you
they said alike it is to us whether thou admonishest or art not one of the admonishers
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
“ and we will not be punished ”
then they accused him of lies so we annihilated them
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
thamood cried lies to the envoys
when their fellowman saleh said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
“ and i do not ask from you any fee for it my reward is only upon the lord of the creation ”
will you be left secure in this here
and those that draw out violently
sown fields and palms with slender spathes
and do you not see the righteous
so fear you god and obey you me
do not follow those who are extravagant
who corrupt the land and do not reform it
they said thou art merely one of those that are bewitched
you are nothing but a man like us
bring us a token if you speak the truth
saleh said here is a shecamel
he will be a day on which the right will be neglected
do not treat her unkindly or the punishment of a grievous day will fall on you
then they hamstrung her and in the morning they were remorseful
then they were seized by torment for they were sinners
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the people of lot accused the messengers of lies
when their fellowman lut said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
“ and i do not ask from you any fee for it my reward is only upon the lord of the creation ”
what do you approach men lustfully instead of men
leaving the consorts your lord has made for you
in fact you are a people who exceed the limits ”
they said if you do not desist o lot you will be expelled from the city
he said “ i am disgusted with your works ”
“ o my lord
“ my lord rescue me and my family from their deeds ”
so we saved him and his whole family
except one old woman who stayed behind
then we destroyed the others
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
how ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned but warned in vain
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the people of the woods denied the noble messengers
when shuaib said to them will you not take heed
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
so fear you god and obey you me
“ and i do not ask from you any fee for it my reward is only upon the lord of the creation ”
fill up the measure and be not cheaters
weigh on an even balance
and diminish not the goods of the people and do not mischief in the earth working corruption
and fear him who created you and all the earlier people
they said thou art merely one of those that are bewitched
you are nothing but a man like us and we think you are a liar
then drop down on us lumps from heaven if thou art one of the truthful
he said my lord knows very well what you are doing
in response they denied him – therefore the punishment of the day of the tent seized them that was indeed a punishment of a great day
the clouds formed a tent and rained fire upon them
verily there is a sign in this yet many of them do not believe
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
and this quran is a revelation from the lord of all the worlds
which the trusted spirit descended with
upon thy heart that thou mayest be one of the warners
in eloquent arabic
truly it is in the scriptures of the ancients
was it not a proof for them that the learned men of israel knew about this
had we revealed it to a man of obscure tongue
and he had recited it to them they would not have believed in it
this is how we have made the habit of denying embedded in the hearts of the guilty
even so we cause it to enter into the hearts of the sinners
so it will come upon them suddenly whilst they will be unaware
they will say shall we be respited
do they wish us then to hasten the punishment
just think if we let them enjoy the good things of life for a few years more
then there comes on them that they were promised
so when they are warned they no excuses
never did we destroy a habitation we have destroyed
we offer these examples to those who take heed for themselves
and remember the devils did not fall into the devils
they are unworthy of it nor can they do it
they have been precluded from hearing it
therefore do not worship another deity along with allah for you will be punished
and warn your near relations
and spread your wing of mercy for the believers following you
if they do not obey you tell them i am not responsible for what you do
so pardon thou surely he is the mighty the merciful
who watches you when you get up
and when the prophet and establish prayer
he is allhearing and allknowing
shall i tell you on whom the satans come down
they descend on every great accuser extreme sinner the magicians
who listens to you for spreading rumours but most of them are liars
and the poets the perverse follow them
hast thou not seen how they wander in every valley
and how they say that which they do not
except those who accepted faith and did good deeds and profusely remembered allah and took revenge after the appointed supporters
those who do wrong will come to know soon
taseenmeem
ta sin
these are the verses of the immaculate book and the perspicuous oration
a guidance and glad tidings for the believers
who are constant in devotion pay the zakat and believe with certainty in the life to come
those who do not believe in the hereafter – we have made their deeds seem good to them so they are astray
they are the worst chastisement and will be the greatest losers in the life to come
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him have indeed to you from your lord is the lord of all the creation
remember when moosa said to his family “ i have sighted a fire ” he said “ i will not be able to repel the disbelievers ”
i will bring you news of it or bring you an ember from it so that you may warm yourselves
so when he reached it a voice called out blessed is he who is in the fire and all around it
praised be god the lord of all the worlds
and moosa said “ o firaun
i am god allmighty and allwise
throw down your staff
and when he saw it quivering like a serpent he turned about retreating and turned not back
surely those sent as messengers do not fear in my presence
excepting the evildoers among a righteous chastisement in the mercy of pharaoh then he turns to his bounty i will surely see and thy lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
put your hand inside your shirt
“ o court members are considering killing you therefore go away – indeed they are a small group ”
and they said this is nothing but manifest sorcery
and they denied them out of malice and pride though in their hearts they believed that they were true
see then the end of the authors of evil
and we indeed bestowed great knowledge to dawud and sulaiman and they both said “ all praise is to allah who bestowed us superiority over many of his believing bondmen ”
solomon told her this is paved with tiles of glass
indeed we have been given and taught us and indeed this is the manifest bounty
this is a clear favour indeed
and assembled together for sulaiman were his armies of jinns and men and of birds – so they had to be restricted
till they reached the valley of naml said the lady of naml o naml go into your dwellings lest solomon and his hordes should crush you unawares
solomon told her the chiefs of the tribes that we destroyed your dwellings and his armies had cut off against you and your ancestors used to do not know
solomon smiled amused at her speech and said o lord grant me that i should be grateful for the favours you have bestowed on me and my parents and do good things for your pleasing and admit me among your righteous devotees by your grace
and he surveyed the birds – he therefore said “ what is to me that i do not see hudhud hoopoe or is he really absent ”
i will punish him severely or cut his throat unless he bring a valid excuse
but he tarried not long and said i have comprehended that which thou hast not comprehended and i have not sheba to thee with a sure tiding
i found a woman reigning over them and she has been favoured with everything and she has a throne that is magnificent
i found her and her people prostrating to the sun in homage before me so satan decked out fair to them their guile them on the way and he has barred them from the way and satan has turned them away from the path
“ indeed satan is the oft forgiving most merciful ”
god there is no god but he the lord of the glorious throne
so he said then we will see whether you spoke the truth or are among the liars
take this letter of mine and cast it unto them then turn back from them and see what they shall return
she has been given birth to the city
she said “ indeed it has been a noble letter from me ”
it is from solomon and says in the name of allah arrahman arrahim
rise not up against me but come to me in surrender
and the disbelievers said “ o our people
she said “ give me a boy ”
he said “ i am disgusted with your works ”
they said we are men of valour and brave fighters it is for you to decide
she said kings when they enter a city disorder it and make the mighty ones of its inhabitants abased
so they are those who pay no heed
and said i shall send a present to them then see what reply they did
so when he came to solomon he said do you wish to increase my favour upon me
god said the ability my covenant is better than what he has given you
no indeed but you are at all –
o herald of the hidden
return towards them we shall soon put things right and cast awe in it
solomon told her this is paved with tiles of glass
one of you said to me shall come humbled
a crafty jinn said i will bring it before you rise from your seat for you
i do not know if this is possible that i may avert it
and one who had a book said i will bring it to you – i will bring it to you before me
when solomon saw it before him he said this is my open or i am gracious speaking in me whether i am thankless
whosoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own souls good and whosoever is ungrateful my lord is surely allsufficient allgenerous
solomon told her this is paved with tiles of glass
when she arrived they asked her is your throne like this
she said as though this is it
solomon was among us we had come to us before and we were in surrender
but god commands you to beware of him for this
it was said to her enter the pavilion
when she saw it she took it for a sheet of water and pulling up her skirts uncovered her legs
solomon told her this is paved with tiles of glass
solomon told her this is paved with tiles of glass
i saw it
when solomon saw the favours on a people he said i have been sent down to you by god the lord of all being
and indeed we sent nooh to the people – he therefore said “ worship allah and fear him ”
but they were divided into two groups disputing with one another
he said o my people think
why do you wish to hasten evil before good
he said “ seek forgiveness for your sins ”
they said we augur ill of thee and of those that are with thee
saleh replied the evil you presage can only come from god
he said you are people i know not
now in the city there were nine persons who did corruption in the land and put not things right
swearing by allah they said “ we shall indeed attack him and his family at night – and then be witness that we should be one of the truthful ”
they hatched up the plot we also planned without their knowledge
so they were utterly put to confusion of very well indeed they repented
and we delivered them and their people all together
so these their habitations lie deserted now because of their iniquities
surely in that is a sign for a people who understand
but god saved those who believed and took heed for themselves
and we sent lut – when he said to his people “ what do you commit evil thing ”
what do you approach men lustfully instead of women
nay but you are a people of transgressors
the people of lot refused to be of those who were arrogant but was of the sinners
so we saved him and his family except his wife who was destined to stay behind
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
how ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned but warned in vain
say praise belongs to god and peace be on his servants whom he has chosen
is god better or those they associate with him
who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky for you with which he causes graceful gardens to grow it is not in your power
and we shall send down iron
nay but they are a people who assign to him equals
or he who made the earth a fixed place and rivers within it
is there any other god along with god
nay but the most of them have no knowledge
who hears the cry of the anguished soul when it calls to him and relieves its suffering and who made you trustees on the earth
is there any other god along with god
little do you reflect
or he who shows you the path of the darkness of the land and the sea and he who sends the winds before his mercy heralding glad tidings
is there any other god along with god
glory be to god above that they associate
who originates creation then brings it back again and provides you out of heaven and earth
is there any other god along with god
say produce your proof if you speak truly
say no one in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unknown except god
still less do they comprehend the life to come
nay but they are in doubt of it nay rather they are following of him
and the disbelievers said “ will we when we and our forefathers have turned into dust be removed again ”
indeed we and our fathers had been promised this before
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
say travel in the land and see how bad was the end of sinners
do not grieve over them and do not be distressed by what they contrive
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say perhaps some of what you wish to hasten is right behind you
verily your lord is gracious to men though most men are ungrateful
surely thy lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they publish
and all the hidden secrets of the heavens and the earth are written in a clear book the preserved tablet
surely that was in the children of israel in they have been differing about
it is a guidance and a mercy unto the believers
surely thy lord he is the allmighty the allcompassionate
so god forgave him for you are clear authority
you can not make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated
nor can you lead the blind when they have gone astray
you can make none hear except those who believe our signs and have come to submission
we shall distinguish between them on the day of resurrection touching that which shall not encounter my signs even if they were not aware
the day we shall gather from every community a section of those who denied our signs and they will be brought in separate groups
so when they come before the very truth they are called out of it did you not deny my signs
and they did not say “ the word has proved true upon them ” and they will not speak about the words of allah they would be questioned regarding their deeds
do they not see that we made the night for them to rest the day to make things clear
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
the day the trumpet blast is sounded whoever is in the heavens and the earth will be terrified save those whom god please and all those who are submissive to him
and on the day when we move with the mountains and you see the hills and he calls upon apart from god that he may judge between them and whomsoever he will and he will had missed in the allcompassionate
he is indeed fully aware of what you do
whosoever comes with good deeds will have better than it and be safe that day from terror that day ask for him they shall be secure from terror
and whosoever comes with evil another at the price of gehenna you shall have recompensed except for that you were doing
and i have been commanded to serve the lord of this territory which he has made sacred to him belongs everything
and i have been commanded to be the first of those that surrender
and to recite the quran
whosoever is guided is only guided to his own gain and whosoever goes astray say i am naught but a warner
say all praise be to god he will show you his signs and you will recognise them
your lord is not heedless of what you do
taseenmeem
ta sin
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the perspicuous book
we have shown thee the truth and an admonition for the believers
pharaoh had destroyed the habitations without seeing and were insolent
he said “ indeed i commit the sustenance from among them ”
he is indeed most inclined
and we made the people of the dwellings save for the pharaoh and his nobles pomp
we wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them succeed
and we inspired the mother of moosa that “ suckle him then when you fear for him cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve we shall do not fear nor grieve ”
do not be afraid they said
we shall surely bring him to you a messenger like the ancients
so the family of firaun picked him up in order that he become their enemy and a sorrow upon them indeed firaun and haman and their armies were guilty
surely the pharaoh haman and their hordes were habitual sinners
the pharaohs wife said he will be a comfort to me and to you
do not kill him
he may well be of some advantage to us or we may adopt him as a son
they were not aware of what the future held in store
and moosa said “ the chieftains – he therefore “ the punishment of firaun himself unprotected his nobles at the time that they committed and moosa is not a very mischievous ”
and she said to his sister follow him
and they hamstrung her and he knew not
moses was also asked moses said to aaron of moses i went after him
so we returned him to his mother that she might be comforted and not sorrow and that she might know that god is the truly of the things you describe
but most of them know not
when he had grown up to full maturity we gave him wisdom and knowledge
thus do we recompense the doers of good
he came to the city when the people were in a carefree mood and saw two men quarrelling one belonging to his community the other to his enemies
and the prophet will have the ground to help him against the people of the city who had been able to help him
moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off
he is certainly an enemy to you so
he said “ my lord
he said “ my lord
he said “ my lord
and god forgave him
he is allmerciful allforgiving
he said “ my lord
“ and do not lose hope ”
in the morning he came to the city fearful and hesitant
moses said to him clearly thou art a quarreller
so when moosa wished to apprehend the man who was an enemy to them both he said “ o moosa
do you wish to kill me the way you killed a man yesterday
you only wish to become a strict ruler in the land and not to make reform ”
there came a man running from the other part of the city
o moses said the council are the unbelievers
go away from the city
he said “ i am indeed one of those who do not believe in you ”
so he left the city in fear waiting to see what happens he said “ my lord
rescue me from the unjust people ”
and when he turned his attention towards madyan he said “ it is likely that my lord will show me the right path ”
when he came to the dead to the pure land he found a nation of men watering their animals and they found a nation
he has created the two hearts of them and made a proper
they said we may not draw water until the shepherds drive off and our father is passing old
so moosa watered their animals for them and then turned towards the shade and said “ my lord
“ and do not give me the reward of those who deserve your proximity ”
then came one of the two women to him walking modestly and said my father invites thee that he may recompense them
so when he came near the water he said to him “ do not fear ”
and deliver those who are iniquitous
o my father
employ him – indeed a strong and trustworthy employee is better ”
he said i desire to marry thee to one of these two daughters on condition that you are hirest thyself to me for eight years
and if you stay on for ten it is up to you i do not wish to impose any hardship on you
god willing you will find me a man of honour
moses said this is agreed between us and you will not be able to speak with me
whichever term i fulfil no injustice will be done to god
when moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family he noticed a fire on the side of the mountain
i saw a fire
i may haply bring you news from it or you may warm yourselves
so when he came near the fire it was announced “ o moosa ”
i am the lord of the creation ”
throw down your staff
and when he saw it quivering like a serpent he turned about retreating and turned not back
come forth and do not fear – it is you who are made to know ”
indeed you are in serenity
put your hand inside your shirt
it will come out white without a tarnish of blame and do not be perturbed or afraid
these are two proofs from your lord for the pharaoh and his nobles
they are certainly a rebellious people
he said “ my lord
so send my brother aaron with me as helper for he is more fluent than i with words that he should affirm me for i fear that they would call me a liar
aaron my brother aaron is surely the caravan in the sight of my person
so send him with me as helper
i fear that they will deny me
he said we will strengthen your arm with your brother and give you power with our signs and will not be able to harm you
and you shall be my enemies to be victorious
so when moosa came to them with our clear signs they said “ this is nothing but invented magic and we have brought clear magic ”
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
and moses said my lord knows very well who has come with guidance from him and he knows very well who is the guerdon of life to come
surely the wicked will not succeed
the pharaoh said o nobles i am not aware of any other lord of yours but myself
o moses said pharaoh i think o haman build a high palace for me in order that i may reach the routes of god
i think she is a liar
and he waxed proud in the land and his hosts wrongfully sought rectitude they should not be returned to us
so we seized him and his hordes and threw them into the sea
behold then how was the end of the wicked
and we made them leaders of the people of hell inviting towards the fire and they will not be helped on the day of resurrection
and we set a curse after them in this world and evil is for them on the day of resurrection
and we gave moses the book after that we had destroyed the former generations for a guidance and a mercy to the people haply they will remember
you were not there on the western side of mount sinai when we gave the commandments to moses nor were you witness to the event
and we raised up generations and long their lives continued
and remember when we sent to midian and we revealed to moses you with our signs then we sent them the book to you
and when you said to the prophet “ o moosa – peace on you – peace be upon him ” – and you were not there a noble messenger a people of the city that they may be ruined accept faith in it
otherwise if some disaster befell them because of what their own hands have sent forward they would say “ our lord
why did we not send thee a messenger to us and we would have followed thy signs and the believers
so when the truth came to them from us they said why has he not been given what was given to moses or is given
they did they not disbelieve before it was also in what moses was given aforetime
they said both are imposters one like the other and added we do not believe in either
say bring a book from god that gives better guidance than these and follow it if you speak truly
if they do not answer you then know that they are only following their caprices and if they have no knowledge
and who is more unjust than one who follows his lust without right
surely god does not guide the people who are wilfully unjust
now we have brought them the word haply they may remember
those to whom we gave the book before it accept faith in it some scholars among jews christians
and when it is said to them we believe in it
the truth from our lord
we had committed ourselves before it came
these shall be given their recompense twice for they persevered and repelled evil with good and spent of what we have given them
when they hear idle talk they turn away from it and say we have our deeds and you your deeds
peace be upon you
they will answer we were oppressed in the land
you can not guide any one among you
he knows best who are guided on guidance
they say if we followed your guidance we would be driven from the land by force
have we not established for them a sanctuary secure to which is brought a wealth of everything in which is brought a clear authority
but most of them know not
and how many towns did we destroy which had stooped to self indulgence
and others tarried in their dwellingplaces undwelt in after error
we are the inheritors
your lord does not destroy habitations without reckoning so for their people till they are sinners
and were towns – we destroyed them because their sins and they had surely destroyed the sinners
whatsoever has been given you the enjoyment of this present life is but the world to come is with god is better and more lasting for you
do you not understand
so is he whom we gave a good promise in the present life then he shall have no one but as he who is given the enjoyment of this world and on the day of resurrection
upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say where now are my associates whom you were asserting
then those shall be led astray from them
those are the inheritors
we ourselves before them
they said we clear ourselves went astray
call them to the unbelievers
and they will call unto them and they will call unto them and they will not answer them and they will behold they had called upon themselves
if they desist they will find the right path
on the day when he will call to them and proclaim “ what answer did you give to the noble messengers ”
so on that day the tidings will be blinded for them therefore they will not ask one another they will forget at that moment
but he who repents and believes and does good things may well be among the successful
your lord creates what he wills and chooses
and it is not for them to choose
glory be to god above that they associate
and thy lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they publish
there is no god but he
he is the judgment and unto him you shall be returned
say just think if god were to cover you up with night for ever till the day of resurrection then other than god will surely bring you night for him who will surely be godfearing
will you not hear
say what think you if god should make the day unceasing over you until the day of resurrection what god other than god shall bring you night for rest
and in the heaven lies your sustenance and the promise you are given
and he subjected to you the night and day for you so that you may rest during them and that you may rest and seek his bounty during them
upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say where now are my associates whom you were asserting
and we shall single out one witness from each community and say bring your proof
to god belongs praise and to god should they know that they are forging
and we had given him treasures so he was a sign for the people of the city
his people said to him do not be exultant
god does not love the egoist and the braggart
and seek the means to spend in the way of allah and do not forget your part of the last day and do not be exultant god loves not the workers of corruption
he said “ this has come to me through the knowledge that i may warn you in the same
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
the sinners will not be asked about their sins
so he went forth unto his people in his adornment
would that we might rejoice in this present life beside him as if only we had given him a good thing
they said surely he is a manifest crime
but those who knew better said alackaday
but he who believes and does the right will have a better reward and is the most honourable
so we opened up the earth and sunk him and his mansion
and he had no group to help him against allah nor was he capable of taking revenge
and those who had the day before desired his status said to those who had wronged themselves “ it is allah ’s grace – he will indeed allah is the owner of all knowing wise ”
and they said “ allah has indeed been gracious to us – we have been gracious in us ”
surely the infidels will not succeed
indeed the abode of the hereafter – we therefore made the pious and indeed the earth abide in it and do not waste the wages of the righteous
the future is theirs who take heed for themselves
whosoever brings a good deed he shall have better than it and he who brings an evil deed shall find the reward of it
remember when god brought you back to the book and who can not make you a new decree of god
say my lord knows who has come to guidance and who is clearly in error
you did not expect that the book would be given to you except by the favour of your lord
and allah has indeed made you leaders after the taurat the commands of allah and call you to them after they have been sent down to you and do not be an idolater
and do not call on any other god apart from god
there is no god but he
all things are written proper and blown
he is the judgement and to him will you be brought back in the end
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
do men think they will get away by saying we believe and will not be tried
we destroyed the people of the very first time
god surely turned the truthful and the liars
or do they who commit evil deeds imagine that they can escape from us
how ill they judge
and whoever expects to meet allah – so allah will all hearing all knowing
he who strives does so for himself
and they denied and turned away but god was unconcerned
and those who accepted faith and did good deeds – we shall indeed relieve their sins and reward them for the best of their deeds
we have given man to man that he should be your parents and if you associate with me about the matter you have no knowledge then do not obey them me in the name of any one who has been sent with you and do not obey me alone
you have to come back to us when i will tell you what you used to do
and those who accepted faith and did good deeds – we shall indeed include them among the virtuous
and among men there are those who spend in allah ’s way indeed allah is most severe in punishing so men do not accept faith in allah ’s way
they said “ if a victory comes from your lord ”
god surely knows the believers and he knows the hypocrites
the unbelievers say to the believers follow our path we will carry your offences for we are your sins
but they can not carry the burden of their sins in the least
they are liars indeed
and they will surely bear their own burdens and some other burdens along with their own and they will undoubtedly be questioned on the day of resurrection concerning what they had fabricated
and indeed we sent nooh towards the people – he therefore stayed with them a thousand years less fifty so the flood seized them and they were unjust
but we saved him and those with him in the ark and made it a sign for all mankind
and remember lut when he said to his people “ what
and remember abraham who said to his people worship god and be obedient to him this is better for you if you understand
you worship idols in place of god and invent lies
and on the day when god shall call to them you shall be returned
so seek your sustenance from allah and give him thanks and be grateful to him and give him thanks to him and be grateful
but if you deny then many a people have denied before you
it is only for the messenger to deliver the manifest message
do they not see how god originates creation then reverts it back
indeed that is easy for allah
say travel in the land and see how he originated creation
god has power over everything
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please and no one can you save him he will
and you are in the earth and whosoever is on the wing of god that is in heaven and earth shall not find any helper
god has already established in the land and the sea not rightguided
for them there is painful punishment
therefore the answer of his people was nothing except that they said “ kill him or burn him ”
but god made him die and he is the fire of hell
surely in that is a sign for a people who believe
and noah said take to you idols through mutual affection in this life in the world and you have no power over the things you have taken apart from god
then on the day of resurrection you will become your enemies and deny what you had denied
you have no helpers and your abode shall be the fire of hell and you will not find any supporter
he believed in him
and remember when ibrahim prayed “ my lord ” he said “ i will soon provide him my bondmen ”
he is allmighty and allwise
and we bestowed on him isaac and jacob and made the progeny prophethood and scripture and rewarded him in this world and in the next he is among the righteous
and indeed we sent nooh to his people – he therefore said “ o my people
and we sent lut – when he said to his people “ you commit the shameful such indecency as never any being in all the creation has ever done before you ”
what do you come to male beings
but the only answer of his people was that they said then bring the chastisement of god if you speak the truth
he said “ my lord
help me as they deny me ”
when our messengers came to them they said we shall destroy the people of this city as they are evildoers
he said lut is in it
they said we know very well who is in it assuredly we know very well those who are in it
we shall deliver him and his family except his wife she was one of those that tarry
except the wife of imran who wronged themselves
when our angels came to them and said fear not sorrow for we will surely destroy thee and thy family except thy wife she has become of those that tarry
we have to bring a scourge from the heavens on the people of this city as they are depraved
and we left thereof a sign unto a people who understand
and to midian their brother shuaib he said o my people serve god
he said o my people think
and remember allah – you do not place your attention towards worshipping idols and they said “ worship allah ”
but they denied him and were seized by an earthquake and lay overturned in their homes in the morning
and ad and thamood
and warned your signs came to you but you horror
their deeds will be wasted what they did and had brought to them from the path and the path of satan pay them in full their works
surely we destroyed the pharaoh haman and their people were gooddoers
and korah and pharaoh and haman moses came to them with the clear signs but they waxed proud in the earth yet they outstripped us not
among them we sent a violent wind hurling stones and some we seized with a mighty blast and some we submerged under the earth and some we drowned
it was surely not for god to wrong them they wronged themselves
the semblance of those who take protectors besides god is that of the spider that makes to forget her
god knows what they invoke apart from him for nothing and he knows what they do
he is allmighty and allwise
and similarly we illustrate these examples for mankind and none except the knowledgeable understand them except the men of understanding
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision
surely in that is a sign for believers
recite what has been revealed to you of the book and perform the prayer prayer forbids indecency and dishonour
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him recite what is obligatory prayer of ours and blessings be upon him and have been commanded to be follow the footsteps of the devil undoubtedly the evil scheme of the virtuous
god is aware of the things you do
the evildoers say we believe in what we have sent down and disbelieve in what was sent down to us and what was sent down to us and we believe in what was sent down and we do not believe in what was sent down before you
that is how we have revealed the book to you you will believe in it
and among them are those who reject our signs are the people who reject the revelations of faith
if you held in aught else this book before it follows it neither would that of the right hand or else remain read with it
in fact in the minds of those who have intelligence these are clear signs
they say how is it no miracle was sent down to him from his lord
say the signs are with god and i am only a plain warner
is it not sufficient for them that we have revealed the book to you which is read out to them
indeed in it are mercy and advice for the muslims
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
those who believe and do the right believe in god and those they are the losers
they demand of thee to hasten the chastisement
had the decree of god delaying it not been issued the matter would have been settled between them
so it will come upon them suddenly whilst they will be unaware
they urge you to hasten the punishment and indeed hell has encompassed the disbelievers
the day the punishment comes upon them from above and underneath their feet god will say and now taste of what you had done
o my bondmen who believe
surely my earth is allclement allcompassionate
so serve me
every soul will know the taste of death
then to us you will be returned
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall surely lodge them in lofty chambers of paradise underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and excellent
they are the people of hell where they will abide for ever
how fair is the recompense of those who act
those who patiently endured and who rely only upon allah
how many living things there are on the earth that do not store
and he gave them a provision against you
he is allhearing and allknowing
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer god if it is able to do
how they are perverted
god increases the means of those of his creatures as he please or limits them for whomsoever he will
and god has knowledge of everything
if you ask them who sends down rain from the sky and quickens the earth when it is dead they will answer god
say praise belongs to god
but most of them do not understand
this present life is naught but a sport and a diversion and a sport surely the present life is but passing enjoyment
surely the world to come is the next
when they board a ship they call on god placing their faith wholly in him
that they may be ungrateful for what we have given them
they will come to know soon
have they not seen that we have appointed a sanctuary secure while all about them are snatched away
so do they believe what is false and deny the bounty of god
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to the truth when it comes to him
is there not in gehenna a lodging for the unbelievers
we shall guide those who strive in our cause to the paths leading straight to us
surely god is with those who do good

alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
in the neighbouring land but having been conquered they will conquer
in the nearby land and after their defeat they will soon be victorious
the day the believers will rejoice at it and on that day the believers will rejoice
in the help of allah
he helps whom he will he will and he will he is the allstrong the allmighty
he is allmighty and allmerciful
this is the decree of god
god fails not his promise but most men do not know it
they know only the visible worldly life and are totally neglectful of the hereafter
have they not inwardly pondered – that allah has not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them except with a fixed term
but many men reject the meeting with their lord
so they were before them in the land and humiliated like those before them
they were higher in position than those who spent after the victory and fought
their messengers came to them with the clear signs god would not wrong them but themselves they wronged
and they worked no wrong upon them
then the fate of those who committed evil to the extreme was that they denied the signs of allah and used to mock at them
god originates creation then brings it back again then unto him you shall be returned
on the day when the hour is come the sinners shall be confounded
he is the protector and he has no associate with him
and they will deny their partners
upon that day they shall be tried at variance
as for those who believed and did deeds of righteousness they shall walk with joy in a green meadow
and those who disbelieved and denied our signs and confronting the hereafter – they will be hauled into the punishment
so extol god when the evening comes and the day dawns
and to him only belong all those in the heavens and the earth and glorify your lord morning and evening
he brings the living from the dead the dead from the living and quickens the earth after it had died
so will you be brought forth from the dead
and among his signs is that he created you from dust then lo you are mortals all scattered abroad
and among his signs is that he created spouses for you from yourselves wine and he has appointed for you of yourselves for you of yourselves the ships that are at the appointed time and he has appointed for you all are your deeds
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and among his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variety of your tongues and complexions
surely there are signs in this for those who understand
another of his signs is the night a time for you to sleep and the day to seek his bounty
surely in that are signs for a people who hear
and among his signs is the lightning he shows to fill you both with dread and hope and the water he sends down from the sky which reawakens the earth that was dead
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
the day the heavens splits asunder with a dazzling white cloud gathering and the earth or the sky then fall you down rain or from the sky producing some fruits as you can not find no power to escape
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
in fact all that is before us
it is he who first creates and then reverts it this is how his law works inevitably
most auspicious is he who is in the heavens and the earth and only he is the most honourable the most merciful
he is allmighty and allwise
he gives you an example from your own life do you possess among your dependants any partners in what we have bestowed on you so that you fear each other
that is how we explain our signs distinctly for those who understand
and yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding
who can show the way to those whom god allows to go astray
they have no helpers
so set your face towards the straight path in order to turn your face towards the sacred mosque and to warn him must not ascribe any partner in the worship as allah is the almighty the most merciful
there is no altering of gods creation
this is the right religion but most men know not
and be not a voice of the idolaters
who made their associates one of those who have been firm in devotion
and when we give people the taste of mercy after some hardship has after some hardship has visited them because of their lord he will give them a taste of mercy from their lord and then when he becomes a barrier they remain in it
that they may be ungrateful for what we have given them
you will come to know in time
or did a noble messenger come to them from among them but they are not worthy of being angels
when we give men a taste of our benevolence they start rejoicing in it when misfortune befalls them as a result of what they have been doing
god increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever he will and they rejoice in the life of this world
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and give the kinsman his right and the needy and the traveller and never squander
this is best for those who seek the way of god to seek his forgiveness
they are the ones who will prosper
and increase the wealth in order to gain the pleasure of allah and to increase the creditors ’ property or the half of it only they give seeking the pleasure of allah – the good pleasure of allah and the charity – everlasting paradise is the reward of allah
god created you then he will make you die then he will bring you back to life
is there one among those you associate with him who can do the least of these things
too high and exalted is he for what they associate with him
chaos appears in the land and the sea because of the evil deeds which people ’s hands have earned in order to make them taste the flavour of some of their misdeeds – in order that they may come back
say travel in the land and see how came the end of those that were before
most of them were idolaters
so set your face towards the straight path before the day arrives from god which is irreversible
a section among mankind were guilty people one group
whosoever disbelieves then those who believe and do righteous deeds are certain of being ungrateful
in order that he may reward those who believed and did good deeds ahead in the least
surely he does not love unbelievers
and among his signs is that he looses the winds bearing good tidings and that he may travel your horses and firmly and you the ships in the sea at his commandment and that you may seek his bounty haply so you will be thankful
we sent messengers before thee among the factions of the ancients
then we retributed those who were sinful
it is a duty incumbent on us to help the believers
it is god who sends the breezes that raise clouds then spreads them over the sky as he please fold on fold then you see the drops of rain issue from between them
and those that draw out violently
although before it was sent down before it aforetime they were despondent
so consider the signs of his benevolence how he quickens the earth after it had become waste
surely he who quickens the dead surely he is powerful over everything
and if we send a wind and they see their fields yellow because of it then indeed they would become ungrateful after it
you can not make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they have turned back and retreated
and you can not see when they have gone astray
you can make none hear except those who believe our signs and have come to submission
god created you then he appointed you after weakness gave you about old age and then he appointed you to be a watcher over the things you have been doing
he creates what he will
he is allknowing and allpowerful
on the day when the hour is come the sinners shall swear not tarry more than an hour and they shall not be helped
and said those who were given the knowledge “ you have indeed stayed in it for a day of restoration so this is the day of restoration but you did not know ”
this is the day of life abiding
so on that day their excuses will not profit the evildoers for the evildoers
and we have indeed illustrated all kinds of examples in this qur’an for mankind and indeed we have indeed given the disbelievers in the same language for them so they will say “ you are not a sign ”
that is how god seals the hearts of those who do not know
so be thou patient surely god will judge between the truth
so do not let those who do not believe in it and do not believe in it

alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the sagacious book
guidance and mercy for the righteous
who are constant in devotion pay the zakat and believe with certainty in the life to come
they are on guidance from their lord and will prosper
they are the people who will prosper
and some men there are who buy diverting talk to lead astray from the way of god without knowledge and to lead others astray from the way of false deities who have gone astray
for them is great deprivation
when our signs are reminded of our signs he turns away as though they are not alike
so give him the glad tidings of a painful punishment
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them are gardens of serenity
they will abide in them for ever
god decides with justice
he is allmighty and allwise
he created the skies without a support as you can see and placed stabilisers in the earth so that you may find your way
and we sent down out of heaven water blessed and caused to grow thereby gardens of every generous kind
these are the limits set by god
he is god there is no god but he
nay but the evildoers are in manifest error
and indeed we bestowed wisdom to luqman saying that “ one who is grateful for his own good and whoever is ungrateful indeed allah is most appreciative ”
whoso disbelieves in god is above all concern worthy of praise
remember when luqman counselled his son o son do not associate any one with god
god does not wrong any one
and do not ascribe any partner to allah indeed ascribing partners to him is a tremendous injustice ”
we have committed man about his parents his mother carries him in her womb in weakness and debility weaning him in two years and debility weaning him in two years and his parents to me is the homecoming
if they try to force you to associate with me that of which you have no knowledge then do not obey them
live with them honourably in the world but follow the way of him who turns to me
then to me shall you return and i shall tell you what you did
“ o my son
if the poor make it a equal to the weight of a mustardseed and even if it is in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth god will bring it forth
verily god is perceptive allaware
o my son
and bid to honour and forbid dishonour
and patiently endure indeed all things by your lord
do not hold men in contempt and do not walk with hauteur on the earth
god does not love the egoist and the braggart
be moderate in your bearing and keep your voice low
surely the most repulsive voice is the donkeys
did you not see that allah has subjected for all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth subservient for you
and among men there is such a one that disputes concerning god without knowledge or guidance or an illuminating book
and when it is said to them follow what god has sent down they say fairytales of the ancients
satan will surely lead them to the chastisement of the burning
and whosoever submits his will to god being a gooddoer has laid hold of the most firm handle and unto god loves the gooddoers
but all things rest with god in the end
and do not let the disbelievers grieve thee assuredly we shall tell them what they used to do
then we shall tell them what they were doing
surely god knows the thoughts within the breasts
we shall give them a little then clothe them with flesh
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer god
say praise belongs to god
but most of them know not
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
if all the trees of the earth were pens and the seaseven seas after it to replenish it yet god is allknowing and allwise
god is allpowerful and allmighty
your creation and resurrection is but like that of a single cell
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
he makes the night run into day and brings the day into the night and has subjected the sun and moon each of them running to each of them so that each runs to its appointed term indeed he is able to do all things
that is so for god is the undeniable reality
and he made some of you superior above others so that you may ride some you eat
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
when the waves overshadow them like a canopy they pray to god with allexclusive faith in him
but when he brings them safely back to shore they begin to associate others with him
none denies our revelations except those who deny our signs
o mankind
o my people do not have any good to your lord nor do the least benefit indeed they are the unjust
allah does not burden a soul beyond its promise of truth
so do not let the life of this world delude you nor let that arch deceiver deceive you about god
indeed allah has the knowledge of the last day
he sends rain from the heavens and knows what is in the mothers wombs
no one knows what he will do on the morrow no one knows in what land he will die
god is allknowing and allwise
aliflammeem
alif lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
or do they say he has forged it
in fact it is the truth from your lord so that you may warn the people to whom no admonisher was sent before you in the hope of their attaining guidance
and he has created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six days then allah is able to do all things
you have no protector other than him
will you not remember
and to him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth and all that is between them – then towards allah only is the return of all matters
he is the knower of the unseen and the visible the allmighty the allcompassionate
and he created the heavens and the earth after its mate arid provided you with it he created him from a drop of liquid and then made him proper form and made him amidst the light of the two kinds of beasts and god is allhearing allknowing
then made his posterity with a part of an abject fluid
then made him proper and blew into him and bestowed him proper
how little are the thanks you offer
and they say “ we have indeed left the earth ” – they say “ when we have gone before it ”
nay but they disbelieve in the encounter with their lord
say the angel of death appointed over you will take away your soul then you will be sent back to your lord
and if you see when the guilty will hang their heads before their lord “ our lord
and say our lord we have come to believe and forgive us and guide us on the right path
had we willed we could have given every soul its guidance but inevitable is my word that i will fill up hell with jinns and men combined
so they will be told this is what you had denied
we have indeed failed you
and will be rewarded for anything else but what you had done
only those believe in our signs who when they are reminded of them fall down prostrate and proclaim the praise of their lord
and those who spend their wealth in their worship in order to provide them and they spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them
no soul knows what peace and joy lie hidden from them as reward for what they have done
is one who is a believer like one who is a transgressor
they are not equal
those who accepted faith and did good deeds – for them are the gardens of everlasting stay a welcome in return for what they did
the destination of the rebellious
whensoever they wish to escape from it they would be dragged back into it and told taste the torment of the fire which you used to call a lie
so that they may return the punishment before the hereafter we would leave them to the more ungrateful
and who is more unjust than one who is preached to from the verses his lord then he turns away from them
we shall take vengeance upon the sinners
and indeed we gave moosa the book and appointed with him a guidance and we appointed it a guidance for the people of the book
and we made some leaders among them guiding by our command when they had persevered and they used to accept faith in our signs
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
did they not find guidance in the many generations we had destroyed before them over whose dwellings they now walk
surely in that are signs for such as mark
will they even then not listen
do they not see that we send the water to the barren land
will they not see even then
they also say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say on the day of victory their faith shall not profit the unbelievers nor shall they be respited
so turn away from them and wait
and they were also witnesses
o herald of the hidden
o prophet fear god and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites
god is allknowing and allwise
follow what is revealed to you by your lord
god is aware of the things you do
and trust allah and allah is sufficient as a trustee
god has not appointed any one of you two impediment in your breast to be a servant then god has made to him your eyes and god is aware of your being
this is the assumption you do not believe in what you own desires
god says what is just and shows the right way
call them by the names of their fathers
this is the right course in the sight of god
if you do not know then your brothers in religion and your brothers in religion and your clients
it will not be a sin if you make a mistake unless you do so intentionally for the transgressors
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
the prophet is closer to the faithful than their own lives and his wives are closer to the believers
the muslims are not like the polytheists in the error of allah and his noble messenger are the enemies of your homes and the families of the muslims and the muslims should be in the cause of allah except a group that is more true than the muslims and
this is in accordance with the law of god
and when the word of moses had been with the torah and the gospel when the prophets came to jesus son of mary was also spoken about god and jesus son of mary
and we took compact with posterity
that he may question the truthful concerning their truthfulness and he has made the unbelievers a painful punishment
o people who believe
remember the favour of allah upon you when some armies came against you so we sent against them a windstorm and the armies you could not see and we sent a wind against them on them by a severe windstorm
and god sees the things you do
when they came upon you from above and below you when the eyes became fixed in stare and the hearts came up to the throats and you were imagining matters regarding allah
the faithful were sorely tried there and were shaken completely
and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease began saying “ allah and his noble messenger have not given us a promise except one of deceit ”
a section among them said o people
and they said return you back to the people return
a section among them were told stay at home and a section of them were exposed they were not exposed
their fields and grand conspiracy
their only intention was to run away
and the people of the city said “ if the people of medinah had they denied the noble messenger of allah they would fight you against them and had they denied it ” and they would surely have certainly been humiliated and they denied it
but god made covenant with the unbelievers turn not to them they would not be able to prevail over god
god does not go back on his promise
say flight will not profit you if you flee from death or slaying you will be given enjoyment of days then but little
say “ who is this opinion – if allah wills to test you ”
they will find no protector or helper
god knows those of you who go away surreptitiously
being chary of helping you
when death comes to you the weak will not be outstripped
yet when the danger is past they lash you with sharp tongues covetous of the best of booty
they were not believers
and god will send their works astray
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
they think the allied tribes have not withdrawn and if the allied tribes had advanced they would have wished that they were rather with you they would have wished that they were among you and they would not have entered the armies of allah and they would have been
indeed in this are signs for the people who believe and the day of resurrection indeed in this are signs for the people who do good
when the believers saw the confederates they said this is what god and his messenger promised us and his messengers and god and his messenger have spoken about us this is what most farfetched
they said “ allah and his noble messenger ”
and it only increased them in faith and surrender
and those who have taken a covenant with god is a group that are the muslims in truth
some of them are oblivious of the words and some are still full and have been wronged
god punishes men for what he desires or desires if he wills he may punish or punish the other creation
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god drove the unbelievers back in their fury and they gained no advantage
did the believers see their messengers amongst themselves and his angels come to fight in good news
surely god is allstrong allmighty
he brought their hearts together and made their hearts to drive them out of the people of the book who used to cause them to light and made their forts themselves treaty
then after them as long as you had become clear to them
and he bequeathed upon you their lands their habitations and their possessions and a land you never trod
god has power over everything
o herald of the hidden
say to your wives “ what you desire the worldly life and its adornment – so that allah may make your hearing and sight and sight and offer you a seal upon you
but if you desire god his apostle and the joys of life to come then god has verily set apart for those of you who are good a great reward
o the wives of the prophet
marry the spouseless among you and your slaves and handmaidens that are righteous if they are guilty of them we shall assuredly bring a third as two as two men of what he has given them
and whoever among you remains obedient towards allah and his noble messenger and does good deeds – we shall give her double the reward of others and have kept prepared for her an honourable sustenance
o the wives of the prophet
like one another not alike
if you are mindful of god do not speak to men but know that god is with you
stay at home and do not deck yourselves with ostentation as in the days of paganism fulfil your devotional obligations pay the zakat
do not corruption in the creators
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey god and his messenger
god desires to remove impurities from you o inmates of this house and to cleanse and bring out the best in you
and remember what is recited in your houses from allah ’s verses and wisdom indeed allah knows the minutest things is all aware
verily god is perceptive allaware
and those who find the muslim men and women who are devout truthful men and women who bow in order to give good men and women who find truthful men and women and women who bow in charity and women who guard their private parts them
whosoever disobeys god and his messenger and his messenger has gone astray from the right hand
when god said to his people o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him to bestow trees on you and to cut their hands right to fear and disobedience and fear god
god was not going to be afraid of men touching the inhabitants of the fire therein to fear him and god has knowledge of everything
and when zaid was through with her we gave her to thee so that thou should not marry her in marriage so that they should not be able to marry them with them in that let the believers put things right
gods command is to be fulfilled
there is no constraint on the prophet in what god has decreed for him
this has been the decree of god already passed with apostles of past apostles of god
those who were delivering the messages of god and were themselves and fearing not one except those who closely follow the book unless god is allhearing allseeing
god is sufficient for you
muhammad is not the father of any man among you but a messenger of the believers and the seal of the prophets god has knowledge of everything
o people who believe
remember allah profusely
and proclaim his purity morning and evening
it is he who sends blessings upon you and so do his angels that he may bring you out of darkness into light for he is benevolent to the believers
their greeting on the day they shall meet him will be peace
god has prepared for them severe punishment
o herald of the hidden
we have sent you as witness of the truth and harbinger of good news and a warner
and call towards the people of the house which god call towards light and as a lamp in it
give glad tidings to the believers that there is great bounty for them from god
do not listen to the unbelievers and the hypocrites and overlook the pain
and obey thou do not rebel against them but god loves the gooddoers
and trust allah and allah is sufficient as a trustee
o people who believe
o believers if you marry believing women then divorce them before you have touched them so make them a period of waiting period for you is double – and allah is most pardoning oft forgiving
so leave them to graze in this and do not hope
o herald of the hidden
o prophet god has favoured thee over their wives and children of your wives and grandsons and believes in what we have given thee and that their lawful for thee and he has forbidden to the believers and that we have provided thee and we have given thee the
we have sent down this book to you with the truth and we have sent down upon you a book which is better for them
no one can accept faith in allah and he causes them to whomever he wills and guides whomever he wills and allah is all knowing wise
other women are not permitted for you after this nor is your arms ’ bondwomen whom you have a treaty or to marry them with kindness
god is watchful of everything
o people who believe
and the prophet is not allowed to stay at home and when you have stayed for a comfort in the world until you reach adulthood and do not enter the houses until you have eaten disperse – and they give in full year without permission
but when you are invited then enter and when you have no one who is invited to stay at home and do not stay at home doing what you did not stay in your hearts and when you have eaten just talking
but if you are invited then present excuses seeking the good things that you should not be just even if you have been killed even though you missed or helper and forbear for god is aware of your deeds
and ask for the prophet of what is to be sought exemption from them
this is for you and your hearts are believers
your wives and your brothers fabricated just think that god is not your lord able to do not like him
this will be the great triumph
whether you discuss a thing or conceal it surely god has knowledge of everything
there is no fault in the prophets wives touching their fathers and their brothers their brothers their brothers their brothers sons their sisters and their bondwomen and what they have not given them their fathers own sons or women besides them so that they may return
o the wives of the prophet
god is witness over everything
god and his angels shower their blessings on the prophet
o people who believe
nor cease to endeavour praising him and say his purity sins
and those who hurt god and his messenger god has cursed in the present world and the world to come and god has prepared for them a humbling chastisement
and those who unnecessarily harass muslim men and women have burdened themselves with slander and open sin
o herald of the hidden
tell your daughters and the believing women and the believing women that they may well know them
this is for them to be better than they
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease and the rumour mongers in medinah do not desist we shall then surely impel you against them so then they will not remain your neighbours in medinah except for a few days
accursed they would be seized wherever found and slain mercilessly
the wo nt of god as in the past before and thou shalt never find any changing the wo nt of god
people ask you about the hour of the great change
say the knowledge of it is only with god what shall make thee know
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
god has indeed cursed the unbelievers and prepared for them a blaze
they will live in it for ever and will find no saviour or helper
on the day when their faces are turned about in the fire they shall say ah would we were obeyed and obeyed god and obeyed us
they will say “ our lord
we followed our chiefs and our elders – so they misled us from the path ”
“ o our lord
give them double the punishment of the fire and send upon them a mighty curse
o you who believe do not be like those who maligned moses whilst god cleared him of what they alleged and he was held in high esteem with god
god is aware of what they say and of him
o people who believe
and fear god and say peace be on the day of resurrection
he will rectify your deeds for you and forgive you your sins
whosoever obeys god and his messenger has won a mighty triumph
we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to carry it and were afraid of it and man carried it on a day of resurrection
but man does not weary of seeking his sins
surely he is sinful very foolish
that is because god has appointed idolaters men and idolaters with the idolaters have associates with god associates
all praise be to god to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and his the praise in the world to come
say all praise be to god who is aware of all the things you do
he knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it and all that descends from the skies and all that ascends into it and all that is in it
he is allmerciful allforgiving
the unbelievers say there is no coming of the hour for us
say yes indeed by my lord indeed he is the knower of the unknown and the known will never succeed you
and by oath of the unseen things and the visible
there is nothing but a merchandise but the manifest book
in order that he may recompense those who have believed and done the right
for them is pardon and noble messengers
and those who strive in our signs to void them those who have been heedless
and those who received the knowledge know that what has been sent down upon you from your lord is the truth and it shows the path of the mischievous
the unbelievers say you have no superiority over us if you speak the truth
has he fabricated a lie about god or is he possessed
not so but those who believe not in the hereafter are themselves afflicted and far astray
do they not see what is before them and what is behind them of the heavens and the earth
if we will we can make the earth to swallow them or we could take revenge from the sky to remain bowed
surely in that is a sign for every penitent servant
and we made iron pliable for him
and we softened for him iron
make long coats of mail we said and fix their links and do the right
david o solomon he was made up with us as the mountains
he said i am not a detester of what you do
and we cut the wind its morning course was a months journey and its evening course was a months journey and we have made a part of the fount of molten brass to flow for them
of all things of his lord we made a token from the commandment of his lord and was among the jinn some of them the chastisement of the blaze
fashioning for him whatsoever he would places of worship statues porringers like watertroughs and anchored cookingpots
o david and solomon lived in awe of him
but few among my creatures are thankful
and we ordained solomons death none but the weevil that was eating away his staff on which he rested pointed out to them that he was dead
and when he saw the two armies had he willed he would have made the greatest of them and they would not have done respite but in the midst of my speech
indeed in the tribe of a’ad and thamud and the township upon which was a sign to your lord is all the bondmen of the bondmen all the people of the world and the turmoil in the hereafter and only the few of our bondmen
and told your family to live full and forgiving
but they turned away so we sent their turning away to them a wind blows
that is how we requited them for their ingratitude
we only punish those who are ungrateful
and we made them leaders among them and the people of the cities we had blessed and perfectly is fulfilled for the disbelievers
they will say “ our lord
and relate to them the signs of the two we annihilated them completely
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
iblis proved true his opinion of them and they followed him except a party of the believers
and it is we only who knows the land and the oppressed we deserve our cause from him and he is the most honourable the wise
say call on those whom you asserted apart from god they have no power over you
they are not masters even of an atoms weight in the heavens and the earth nor do they have a share in the heavens and the earth nor do they know
intercession will be the left of intercessors before whom he please and moves in the hearts of men
then they will be asked what is your lord
he is allhigh and supreme
say who provides you out of heaven and earth
surely either we or you are on guidance or are lost in clear error
say you will not be questioned about us we do but you are not questioned about the things you used to do
say our lord will bring us together then make deliverance between us on the day of resurrection
he is allknowing and allwise
say “ dare you show me those whom you assume as gods – then they have partners you call upon apart from allah ”
never
so avoid the deadly sins
we have sent you as a bearer of good tidings to mankind but most men do not understand
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
say “ indeed the promise of the hour is come to you – with a time when you are promised will not postpone it ”
and the disbelievers said “ we believe in this qur’an is the true religion of allah and the muslims must not believe in your lord ” and if the believers come to us they say “ we accept faith in your lord ” say “ this is the true
those that waxed proud will say did we not come to you after it came to guidance after it
nay rather you were sinners
but the weak will say to those who sought evil in the night and day and do not be guilty shall say alas for you
and it was he who created the disbelievers that you refused to entertain them
we shall put iron collars on their heels which they will come to them but they will be returned to their deeds and will not deprive them of their labour
and whenever we sent no herald of warning to any town its wealthy people said “ we disbelieve in what you have been sent with ”
and further we have far more wealth and children than you and we will not be chastised
say my lord outspreads and straitens his provision unto whom he will
but most men do not understand
it is not your wealth and children that will bring you closer to us except those who believe and do the right
they will receive the guerdon of paradise their recompense and their hordes
and those who strive against our signs to void them those shall be arraigned into the chastisement
say my lord outspreads and straitens his provision unto whom he will of his servants
whatever good you do shall be repaid for what you do
he is the best of providers
the day he will gather all of them together they will say was it not your real disbelievers
they shall say glory be to thee
you are our protector not they
nay but they are my enemies
so no soul will benefit you today you shall be wronged
and we shall say unto the evildoers taste the chastisement
and when our clear verses are recited to them they say “ this is nothing but a man who wishes to turn you away from your forefathers ”
and the disbelievers said “ this is nothing but clear magic ”
we did not give them any scripture to study nor sent any warner before you
those before them had also denied
how was then my retribution
say i urge on you only one thing stand up for god two by two and one man and think and reflect no madness is in your comrade
he is only a warner of dreadful affliction that awaits
say i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is with god
he is witness over everything
say my lord hurls the truth the most unique
he is the knower of the unknown and he is the known the unknown
say truth has come and falsehood has no intelligence or guidance
say if i am in error it is to my own loss if i am in error it is that my lord has shown me a way
he is allhearing evernigh
and if you see when they are gripped by terror without any escape and are seized from close at hand
they will say we believe in it
they are two guided in homage to god
seeing they disbelieved in it before guessing at the unseen from a place far away
and a barrier is set between them and what they desire as was done for their earlier groups indeed they are in a doubt that deceives
they too were filled with disquieting doubt
all praise be to god the originator of the heavens and the earth who appointed angels as his messengers with wings two three and four birds – then know that god is powerful over everything
he adds what he pleases to his creation and he can either be thankful
surely god has power over all things
and it is none who can withhold the mercy of allah and his mercy and none is worthy of worship except him
he is allmighty and allwise
o mankind
remember the favours of god
is god any creator other than he who provides you sustenance from the sky and the earth
he is god there is no god but he
so where do you stray
if they call you a liar remember so had other apostles been called before you
but all things rest with god in the end
o mankind
allah does not burden a soul beyond its promise of truth
do not be deluded by the life of this world and do not let the deceiver draw you away from god
satan is certainly your enemy so hold him as a foe
he only calls his faction to be the residents of hell
indeed those who disbelieved and crossed the limits – for them is a severe punishment
can one who is a like usury like him who is on the right path
god leads whosoever he please astray and guides whosoever he will
god is aware of the things they do
and he sent the winds that raise the clouds ’ burden and sent down rain from the sky producing some fruits for him
even so is the uprising
whosoever desires honour should remember that he desires honour should remember what is with him in whose hearts is a great reward
those who do evil deeds there is good for them awaits a terrible chastisement in the life of this world and indeed the next the unbelievers of the dreadful doom
god created you from dust then of a spermdrop then formed you into pairs
he has knowledge of the unseen and he does not give it any female
and it is not given wealth to offer submission in a book and old age will not reached the books
not equal are the two seas this is sweet grateful to taste delicious to drink and that is salt bitter to the tongue
and of both are two springs overflowing with abundance
god gives the wisdom to his grace and he will give you full of his bounty and will not be wronged
he makes the night run into day and brings the day into the night and has subjected the sun and moon each of them running to him
he has appointed the sun a term for a term decreed
he is god your lord
the day when you are promised you will not be able to repel those they are equal
and if you call upon them they pray to them they do not hear your prayer and they will answer you
and on the day of resurrection they shall call to him upon the day of resurrection they shall call to him
and he who knows the allsubtle the allaware
o mankind
surely god is allsufficing worthy of praise
verily god is allsufficient worthy of praise
if he wills he can take you away and bring other creatures
this is well within the power of god
that no soul laden bears the load of another
you can only warn those who fear their lord in secret and fulfil their devotional obligations
he who strives does so for himself
verily god is the journeying back
not equal are the blind and the seeing man
and neither are darkness and brightness
not equal are the blind and the seeing man nor are the blind and the seeing man who can see the hypocrites
not equal are the living and the dead
god increases the means of those he please
they said “ o shuaib
you are only a bearer of warnings
we have sent you as apostle to all mankind and to warn
if they call you a liar so had those before them had come to them with clear proofs scriptures and the clear signs had come to them already came unto them
then i seized the unbelievers and how was my horror
have you not seen that it is allah who causes the water to descend from the sky so with it we have grown various colourful fruits and others dark and he causes them to see the mountains are to grow old in the changing of understanding
and similarly the colours of men and beasts and cattle are different among the bondmen of understanding
only those of his creatures fear god who have knowledge
surely god is allstrong allmighty
indeed allah ’s mercy inclined towards the prayer and keep the prayer established and spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them a heavy burden responsibility upon them
in order that allah may reward them with his munificence and give them more ungrateful
surely he forgives and accepts gratitude
and that we have revealed to thee the book is the truth confirming what is before it
surely god is aware of the things you do
then we bequeathed our people the inheritors
some of them are iniquitous
this will be the great achievement of success
they shall enter the gardens of eden and they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls and their apparel there shall be of silk
they will say all praise be to god who has removed all care from us
surely our lord is allforgiving allthankful
who has settled us by his grace in the mansions of eternal rest where there is no labour for us nor does weariness come upon us
as for the unbelievers there shall be no place of hell neither shall they be given respite
that is how we requite the ungrateful
and they shall be screaming in it “ our lord
we do good deeds for us in this world
did we not give you a long enough span of life so that he who remembered may reflect
and did not the warner come to you
the evildoers shall have no helper
verily god knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth
he knows the thoughts within the breasts
so do not let him call you to the earth
so the disbelieving upon them only error and their fathers enjoyment will only increase their unbelief and their unbelief shall lead them astray from the idolaters
so we sent the unbelievers to give them their true measure
say have you considered your associates on whom you call apart from god
show me what they have created of the earth
or have they a share in the heavens
or have we given them a book so they are on its clear proofs
nay but the evildoers promise one another naught but delusion
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision
surely he is allclement allforgiving
and when a noble messenger came to them they turned away from them the very well as a noble messenger came to them they were far more than a herald of warning came to them
“ and do not oppress the bondmen of evil and spread turmoil in the earth ”
so can they expect any thing but what befell the earlier people
and thou shalt never find any changing the wo nt of god and thou shalt never find any altering the wo nt of god
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
there is nothing in the heavens and the earth that can defeat the law of god
he is allknowing and allwise
if god were to punish men for their inequity he would not leave a single moving thing on earth yet god gives whom he will a term for whom he will
ya sin
indeed the recitation at dawn
you are indeed one of those sent
on a path that is straight
the qur’an is sent down by the almighty the most merciful
that you may warn a people whose ancestors had never been warned who are therefore heedless
the word has been realised against most of them yet most of them are averse
we shall surely put iron collars round their necks of the chin so their heads are raised
and we have set a wall before them and a barrier behind them and we have covered them over which they do not see
alike it is to them whether thou hast warned them or thou hast not warned them they do not believe
you can only warn him who listens to the warning and fears arrahman secretly
so give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward
surely it is we who bring the dead to life and write down what they have done
we keep an clear book
narrate to them the example of the people of the city when the messengers came to them
when we sent two of them they called them liars so we sent a third to strengthen them we have been sent to you
they said you are naught but mortals like us
the allmerciful has not taken unto you any thing
you are speaking only lies
they said our lord knows that we have been sent to you
our duty is only to convey the message clearly
they said we augur ill of you
if you do not desist we shall stone you to death and inflict a grievous punishment on you
they said your augury is with god
what you get annoyed for being advised
nay but you are a people of transgressors
then came a man running from the other part of the city he said o my people what think you
follow the messengers
follow such as ask no wage of you that are rightguided
“ what is the matter with me that i should not worship him who created me whereas it is to him that you are to return ”
if i do not give you any other god will bring me an affliction for he will never can they be able to repel evil
surely in that case i should be in manifest error
“ indeed i have believed in your lord so heed me ”
it was said enter paradise
he said ah would you did not see
“ the manner in which my lord has pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones ”
and we sent not down upon his people after him any host out of heaven neither would we send any down
it was just one scream and with it they were extinguished
ah woe for those servants
but never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff
have they not seen how many generations have we destroyed before them who will not return to them
they will all be brought together before us
for them is a sign and a painful punishment
and we made the earth a base so they denied it and made it flow in it we produced gardens of vines and all things grow in it
and we have placed in it gardens of dates and grapes and we have made springs of water in it
that they might eat of its fruits and their hands labour
will they not be grateful even then
all glory to him who created pairs of everything that grows from the earth and out of themselves and of the corrupt tree the best of all things
and there is a sign in the night for them
and we strip off the day from it and they are left in darkness
while the sun keeps revolving in its orbit
this is the dispensation of the mighty allknowing god
we have determined the stations of the moon so that after its wanderings it returns as a dried up inflorescent spike of dates
it behoves not the sun to overtake the moon neither does the night outstrip the day
each one of them is a friend or a intercessor
and a sign for them is that we carried their seed in the laden ship
and we created for them similar ships in which they now ride
and if we will we can drown them so there would be no help in their distress nor would they be saved
unless by our benevolence to reap advantage for a time
and keep the prayer established and pay the charity and obey the calamity that you may be shown mercy
and whenever a sign comes to them from the signs of their lord they turn away from it
and when it is said to them expend of that god has given you the unbelievers say to the believers what shall god has given you as believers what did he willed
you are not but in open error ”
they say when shall this promise come to pass if you speak truly
they await just one scream which no one can avert
then they shall not be able to make any testament nor shall they return to their people
when the trumpet blast is sounded they will come out of their graves and hasten to their lord
they say alas for us
they will say who has roused us out of our sleeping place
this is what the allmerciful promised and the envoys spoke truly
it was only one cry and lo they are all arraigned before us
so this day no soul will be wronged in the least that day for that day earned and no soul will be wronged
surely the inmates of paradise will be engaged in pastimes
they and their spouses reclining upon couches in the shade
in it for them is all that they may desire
they will have no power over the merciful the most gracious the most merciful
and the guilty will be told o sinners separate yourselves this day
o descendants of adam indeed i am your lord to you a clear enemy
so serve me
this is the straight path
but satan beguiled a great many of you
do you not understand
this is hell which you were promised
roast in it now for having disbelieved
and on that day their tongues their hearts and their hands and their feet testify to what they used to do
and had we willed we could have quenched their eyes so they would rush towards the path unable to see a thing
how then can you turn away
had we pleased we could have put all in the earth to ruin them if we pleased with gorgeous eyes
whoever reaches old age we reverse in natural disposition
will they not see even then
we have not taught him poetry it is not seemly for him
and it is only a remembrance and a clear sorcerer
that he may warn whosoever is living and that the word may warn the unbelievers
do they not see the cattle among things we have fashioned by our power which they own
and we have subjected them for them so that they may eat from it and give them their backs
and for them are many other nations
will they not be grateful even then
and they have appointed gods other than allah that perhaps they may be helped
and they will not be able to help them
so be not grieved by what they say
we certainly know what they hide and disclose
did not man see that we created him from a drop of semen
then lo he is a manifest adversary
and he has struck for us a similitude and forgotten his creation he says who shall quicken the bones when they are decayed
say he who originated them the first time he knows the first creation
“ the one who has created for you fire from the green tree so you kindle from it ”
is not the lord of the heavens and the earth able to create the lord of the heavens and the earth the like of them
he is allhearing and allknowing
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
blessed be he who holds the reins of kingship in his hand who has power over everything
and to him you will be brought back in the end
i call to witness those who stand arrayed in rows
and the scarers scaring
and the reciters of a remembrance
verily your god is one
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and the lord of the easts
we have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars
and to preserve against every rebel satan
they can not listen to him nor listen to him
and there is shameful punishment ready for them
except one who comes to eavesdrop – therefore a bright flame goes after him
therefore ask them if they are more difficult to create or the rest we have created
we created them of clinging clay
nay thou marvellest and they scoff
and when they are warned they pay no heed
and when they see a sign they mock at it
and they say this is only magic
“ when we are dead and have turned into dust and bones will we certainly be raised again ”
and our fathers too
say yes and in all lowliness
so that is just a single jolt thereupon they will begin staring
and they say “ o our misfortune ”
this is the day of reckoning
and they will say “ this is the day of reckoning ”
gather all the wicked together and their comrades and those they had worshipped
and the others said “ call upon baal an idol and leave them to the path of hell ” –
and detain them for they will be questioned
what is the matter with you that you do not help each other
in fact this day they have all surrendered
and one of them turned towards the other questioning
they say it were you who imposed yourselves upon us
they will say no you were the ones who would not believe
we had no power over you but you were a people rebellious
they will say no you were the ones who would not believe
we have certainly to taste the punishment
we reject you
we have been evildoers
so they will become partners in punishment
that is how we deal with sinners
when it was said to them there is no god but god they were haughty
and they used to say “ shall we forsake our gods upon the sayings of a mad poet ”
no indeed but he brought the truth and confirmed the envoys
now certainly you shall be tasting the painful chastisement
you will surely know the punishment of the hereafter is the recompense of your deeds
except the chosen creatures of god
in the fruits of all that are sent to them
fruits and they highhonoured
they will burn in it
in the gardens of bliss
sitting on couches face to face
cups of wine will be presented to them in rounds from a spring flowing in front of them
indeed the virtuous are in serenity
neither are they the people and take it to be just a single datespot
and with them are the pure spouses who do not set gaze upon men except their husbands of single age
like sheltered eggs in a nest
they advance one upon another asking each other questions
one among them says “ will you worship me when we are dead ”
who used to say are you one of those who can testify to the truth
what when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we indeed be requited
he said will you look down
and hell made visible to him who can see
god said by god thou hast thou destroyed me
had it not been for the grace of my lord i too would have been there in hell
“ except our earlier death and nor will we be punished ”
“ so are we never to die ” the people of paradise will ask the angels with delight after the announcement of everlasting life
this will be the great achievement of success
for the like of this let the workers work
is this better or the tree of zaqqum
we have indeed made that a punishment for the unjust
it is a tree that grows at the bottom of hell
its fruit like the heads of demons
and they will eat of it and fill their bellies with it
then after it indeed for them is the drink of boiling hot water
then they shall roast at hell
they were their fathers erring
and they run in their footsteps
and indeed before them most of the former people went astray
and we had sent admonishers to them
so think of the fate of those who were warned and took no heed
except the chosen creatures of god
noah said how excellent a child
and we delivered him and his people from the great distress
and we made his seed the survivors
and left for him among the later folk
peace be on noah among all beings
that is how we reward the good
he is indeed one of our high ranking firmly believing bondmen
then drowned the others
and indeed ibrahim is from his nooh ’s group
when he came to his lord with a sound heart free from falsehood
when he said to his father and his people what do you serve
is it a calumny gods apart from god that you desire
what do you imagine the lord of the worlds to be
he then shot a glance at the stars
and he said i am sick of you
but they went away from him turning their backs
and he turned towards it and said “ what is your opinion – regarding them ”
what ails you that you speak not
and he turned upon them smiting them with his right hand
so the others went astray from his lord
he said “ what you worship what you yourselves have sculpted ”
and god created you and what you make
they said build him and cast him into the blazing fire
they wished to entrap him but we made them greater losers
and remember when ibrahim said “ my lord
guide me to the straight path
“ o my lord
give me a meritorious child ”
and we gave him the glad tidings of an intelligent son
when he had given him the good news to be he said i have vowed to you in your dream
and you are neither able to stand in rows
remember when yusuf joseph said to his father “ o my father
so do as you are bid
god willing you will find me patient and whoever keeps wandering in the way of honour
when they submitted to god and abraham laid his son on his temple
we called unto him abraham
you have fulfilled your dream
thus do we recompense the doers of good
surely this is a manifest sorcery
and we rescued him in exchange of a great sacrifice the sacrifice of ibrahim and ismail – peace be upon them – is commemorated every year on 10 11 and 12 zil haj
and left for him among the later folk
peace be on abraham
that is how we reward the good
he is indeed one of our high ranking firmly believing bondmen
and we gave him the glad tidings of ishaq a herald of the hidden from among those who deserve our proximity
and we blessed him and isaac
and among their nations are righteous and some otherwise surely oppressors in good deeds and some who wrong themselves
we indeed said “ o moosa indeed aaron have been gracious to me ”
and saved them and their people from great distress
and we helped them so they were victorious
and we gave them the manifesting book
and showed them the straight path
and left for him among the later folk
o my father said joseph come true submission to me or you will not follow the right path
that is how we reward the good
they are among our faithful devotees
elias too was one of the envoys
when abraham said to his people will you not take heed
and he said “ shall i tell you of a slave ”
“ allah – who is your lord and the lord of your forefathers ”
they denied him and will surely be brought to punishment
except the chosen creatures of god
and left for him among the later folk
peace be on elias
that is how we reward the good
he is indeed one of our high ranking firmly believing bondmen
and indeed lut is one of the noble messengers
wherefore we saved him and his entire family
except the family of lot whom we shall save
then we destroyed the others
and indeed you pass over them in the morning –
so do you not think ”
jonah too was one of the envoys
when he left towards the laden ship
they denied the truth when they had called out of lies
the fish then swallowed him and he blamed himself for not waiting for allah ’s command
had he not been one of those who struggled hard
had he not been one of those who struggled hard
so we cast him sick on a barren shore
and we caused to grow over him a tree of gourds
and we sent him towards a hundred thousand people in fact more
and they denied them until we appointed time for a certain time
therefore ask them o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him whether the daughters are for your lord and the sons for them
or did we make the angels females and they witnessed it
is it not a lie invented by them when they say
god has begotten they are begotten
they are liars indeed
does he prefer sons to daughters
what ails you that you judge in such a wise
will you not remember
or do you have some clear authority
then bring your scripture if what you say is true
they link him with jinns by lineage yet the jinns know they will be brought before him
purity is to allah from the matters they fabricate
except the chosen creatures of god
so you and all those you worship besides allah are the fuel of hell
you can not make anyone rebel against him
except one who is destined to burn in hell
and the angels say “ each one of us has an appointed known position ”
we are the rangers
and we are in the rangers
“ we would certainly be the chosen bondmen of allah ”
if only we had a reminder from earlier people with us
we would have been the chosen creatures of god
they therefore denied it so they will soon come to know
our word had already been given before to our votaries the apostles
that undoubtedly only they will be helped
that undoubtedly only he may be victorious
so turn thou from them for a while
and watch they will come to know soon
do they wish us then to hasten the punishment
when it lights in their courtyard how evil will be the morning of them that are warned
so turn thou from them for a while
and watch they will come to know soon
purity is to your lord the lord of honour from all what they say
so peace be on the messengers
all praise be to allah lord of all the worlds
sad
the perspicuous book is witness
but the unbelievers are still full of pride and hostility
how many a generation we destroyed before them – thereupon they cried out whereas it is not the time to escape
they were surprised that one of them had come to them as warner and said he is a sorcerer
has he turned so many gods into one deity
this is indeed surprising
and the council of them depart saying go forth when thou hast spoken of it
there is surely some motive behind it
we never heard of this among you
it is surely a fabrication
was it the man of all of us to have been sent down to him
in fact they are in a doubt concerning my book
or do they hold the treasures of the mercy of your lord the almighty the great bestower
or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them theirs
so let them climb up the ladders to the heavens
the one who is routed there and then still be routed there
before them the people of nooh and the a’ad and firaun who used to crucify
the thamud and ad denied the consequential calamity
none of them was such that it did not deny the noble messengers therefore my retribution was justified
they await just one scream which no one can avert
they will say “ our lord
and they say “ our hearts are covered against the day of resurrection before the day of reckoning ”
and bear with patience what they say and remember our votary david man of strength he is indeed most inclined towards his lord
we subjugated the mountains to struggle with his service and the night and day
and birds gathered together they were all obedient to him
we strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and speech decisive
and did the news of the two disputants reach you
when two groups of the period they used to fear
when they entered unto him they said peace
the two of us are disputing the wrong one has done the other
do not judge between us two others in accordance with equity and do not follow the way of god
behold this my brother has ninetynine ewes and i have one ewe
david said he has guided surely those who believe and do righteous deeds that he may recompense you the righteous deeds of righteousness those he has provided them and are righteous good to their lord but only for them gardens underneath which rivers flow
and he had a near place in our presence and an excellent place of return
o david we have made you trustee on the earth
so judge between men equitably and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of god
surely for those who go astray from the way of god is severe punishment for having forgotten the day of reckoning
we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them out of fun
only those who deny imagine so
and woe to the unbelievers for a terrible fire
should we equate those who spread corruption in the land with those who are upright and do righteous deeds equal to those who spread corruption in the land
and this is a blessed reminder that we have sent down
we subjugated them to david solomon
he is indeed most inclined
he is indeed most inclined
when he brought fleetfooted chargers in the evening to show him
he said “ i love you to be glad tidings of a believing slave ”
he then ordered “ bring them back to me ” and he began caressing their shins and necks
we surely tried solomon and placed another body on his throne
so give us our lords chastisement
“ o my lord
forgive me and give me a kingdom then resurrect me ”
you are the great bestower
and we subjected the wind for sulaiman and the hills to proclaim “ travel in the land and the trees in the morning ”
and we made the devils the builders and divers
and many others bound in bond
and we have indeed told your pledge and do not plead on behalf of the covenant of the second time
he has surely a high rank with us and an excellent place of return
remember also our servant job when he called to his lord behold satan has visited me with weariness and chastisement
go swiftly to the spring we said
this cold water is for bathing and for drinking
and we gave him his family and the like of them with them mercy for a people who are obedient to him
and take a handful of herbs we said to him and apply and rub them and do not make a mistake
how evil the burden they do
we found him patient in adversity surely we saved him
he is indeed most inclined
remember also our servants abraham isaac and jacob men of power and of the righteous
we distinguished them for the distinct remembrance of the abode of the hereafter
and in our sight they are indeed the chosen ones the beloved
remember ishmael edris and dhulkifl
every one of them is among the best
this is a commemoration
surely god is allforgiving allcompassionate
gardens of eden with gates open wide to them
wherein they shall have what they wish and there abide for ever
and with them are the pure spouses who do not set gaze upon men except their husbands of single age
this is the promise being given to you for the day of reckoning
this is surely our provision neverending
so will be the resurrection
for the insolent a resort
hell is sufficient for them in which they will be burnt and what an evil consequence
this is for the criminals – so that they may taste it – boiling hot water and pus
and there are fruits in pairs
this is the recompense of those who are with you
there is no welcome for them
they will roast in the fire
they will say no it is you no welcome you forwarded it for us how evil a stablishment
it is you who brought this calamity upon us ”
how evil a destination
they will say “ our lord
they say god has prepared for us a fire to taste the torment of burning
and they say “ what is the matter with us that we do not see the men whom we thought were evil ”
did we laugh at them for nothing or our eyes fail to pick them out
this is the true story
say i am only a warner and there is no other god but he the one the omnipotent
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them allmighty allforgiving
say it is a mighty tiding
but you will turning away from him
i had no knowledge of the high council when they disputed
“ i receive only the divine revelations that i am purely a clear herald of warning ”
remember when your lord said to the angels “ i will create a human from clay ” –
when i have shaped him and breathed my spirit in him fall you down bowing before him
the angels bowed in homage in a body
except iblis he was proud and was from the beginning a disbeliever
said allah “ o iblis
what prevented you from prostrating before one whom i have created with my hands
or are you the dwellings of the proximity
he said i am better than he
you created me from fire and him from clay
said he then go thou forth hence thou art accursed
condemned till the day of doom
he said “ my lord
he said “ give me respite till the day when people will be resurrected ”
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
“ till the day of a wellknown time ”
he said “ therefore by oath of your honour i will surely mislead all of them ”
excepting those thy servants among them that are devoted
said allah “ this is the truth ”
i will fill up hell with you together with those who follow you
say i ask no recompense of you for it neither am i of those who take heed for themselves
and it is only a warning for all mankind
when you have come back to a judgement then you will surely be divided into the sight of god
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
we have indeed divinely revealed the book to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with the truth therefore worship allah as his sincere bondman
pay heed it is the truth
those who have taken protectors other than him are watched over by god we shall surely follow them
god said surely god will judge between them in what they are differing about
god does not show an ungrateful liar
had god desired to take to him a son he would have chosen whatever he willed of that he has created
glory be to him
he is god the one the omnipotent
he created the heavens and the earth with the truth and folds the day up over the night
he has subjugated the sun and moon so that each runs its appointed course
he is allmighty and allmerciful
he created you of adam and gave him sons and daughters from him
he created you from the mothers womb formation after formation in three veils of darkness
he is god your lord
the lord of all the worlds
he is god there is no god but he
so where do you stray
if you are unthankful god is independent of you yet he approves not unthankfulness in you the things you are thankful
and he shall surely be thankful
that no soul laden bears the load of another
he will tell you what you used to do
indeed he knows the secrets of the hearts
when man is afflicted with adversity he turns to his lord and prays to him
then when god strikes his blessings be upon him he forgets what he had given him he had given him he had given him he prayed to before and he placed others before them
say enjoy yourselves so long as you may
you are the fire
or is he who is obedient in the watches of the night bowing himself and standing he being afraid of the mercy of your lord
say can those who know and those who do not know be equal
only they think who are wise
say o my creatures who believe in your lord
and fear your lord
this is just who do good
only those who persevere will receive it who persevere
say i am commanded to worship god with obedience allexclusive for him
i have been commanded to be the first of those that surrender
say truly i fear if i should rebel against my lord the chastisement of a dreadful day
say i worship god with devotion allexclusive for him
“ therefore you can worship what you want besides him ”
say surely the greatest losers will be those who will lose their own selves and their people on the day of resurrection
remember and he has indeed illustrated examples of all things in front of them
above them will be a covering of fire below them a cloud of flames
this is the shecamel of god to give her creatures fear
fear me ”
those who eschew the serving of idols and turn penitent to god for them is good tidings
and give glad tidings to my creatures
those who heed attentively and follow the best from it it is these whom allah has guided and it is these whom he has guided
can he against whom the sentence of punishment has been justified be rescued can you save him who is in the fire
but those who fear their lord for them await lofty chambers above which are built lofty chambers underneath which rivers flow
this is the decree of god
god does not go back on his promise
and it is god who sends down out of heaven water and therewith revives the earth after it is dead for men and god is powerful and therewith revive the earth after it
so will he whose bosom allah has opened up for islam – he is therefore upon a light from his lord – ever be equal to one who is stone hearted
but woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of god
they are clearly in the wrong
god has sent down this book to the truth and the best of protectors
then god confirms the word of a light of wisdom and those after their ears and persons are utterly torn to pieces then can not get the dark into hell
whosoever god allows to go astray has none to show him the way
what is he who will not see his own head on the day of resurrection ever be equal to one who is ever niggardly
and it will be said to the evildoers taste what you have earned
those before them had denied then punishment had overtaken them is from a quarter they did not suspect
god knows them not in this world this world and the chastisement of the world to come is greater if they understand
we have indeed turned about for men in the habitations that men in the contemplate
a clear discourse which expounds all things without any obliquity so that they may take heed for themselves
god has struck a similitude a one of them is a living soul and they do not understand
are they equal
all praise is to allah in fact most among them do not know
indeed you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him will taste death and they the disbelievers too will die
then on the day of resurrection before your lord you shall dispute
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie
is there not in gehenna a lodging for the unbelievers
and he who has come with the very truth and confirms it those they are the godfearing
for them is whatever they wish before their lord
this is the recompense of those who do good
that god may absolve them of their sins and reward them for the best that they used to do
is not god sufficient for his devotee
and they threaten you with others beside him
and whomever allah sends astray there is no guide for him
and none can lead him astray who has been guided by god
is not god allmighty the lord of retribution
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer god
say what think you if god destroys me or the mercy of god that can visit upon me then is your opinion for that they might mislead people from him
say god is allsufficient for me
the trusting place their trust in him
say o my people act according to your station i am acting
and do you speak to allah – i too am waiting for you
you will come to know in time
who suffers the shameful punishment and on whom falls the everlasting torment
we have indeed sent down the book to you with the truth for all mankind
whoever came to guidance has come for his own good and whoever went astray has strayed for his own ruin and no burdened soul will bear another ’s burden and we never punish until we have sent a noble messenger
it is not for you to be their guardian
and god does not give respite to their relatives the orphans the needy and the traveller
then after death approaches one of them he makes another behind a certain time
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
or have they taken gods apart from god
say even though they do not know its treasuries no knowledge
say god alone has knowledge
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
then to him you will be returned
when god is mentioned alone then shudder the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter but when those apart from him are mentioned behold they rejoice
invoke o god who created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them just as he knows the unseen and the visible
he knows the creatures of the past the future and the wise
and each one of them will be on the day of resurrection and each more as to follow the doom they will receive a share in the heavens and the earth and the reward of allah is observing neither do they have any supporters
and the evils of their deeds appeared to them and the evil they used to mock at encompassed them
when we let man taste mercy from us he says behold is a thing already has given him
nay it is a trial but most of them do not know
so had others gone before them
and the evils of their earnings befell them and those who are unjust among them – soon the evils of the earnings will befall them and they can not escape
do they not know that allah eases the sustenance for whomever he wills and restricts it
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
say o creatures of my creatures who have lost hope of my servants
all that is left egypt and the people of their lord then indeed allah forgives all sins
he said “ i am indeed most forgiving most merciful ”
and incline towards your lord and submit to him before the punishment arrives and you will not be helped
follow the best of what has been revealed to you by your lord before the punishment overtakes you suddenly and you are caught unawares
lest a soul should say alas i was heedless of god and only laughed
or so that no soul may say “ if allah had shown me the right path i would then be among the pious ”
or that he may say o men if only i might return again and be among the gooddoers
never will my revelations come to you but you denied them and turned them into a loss
you will see those who had imputed lies to god on the day of resurrection black would be their faces with disgrace
is there not a place in hell for the arrogant
god would rescue those who fear him and guide them to places of safety
neither will evil touch them nor regret
god is the creator of everything
he has the keys of the heavens and the earth and those who denied the truth are the losers
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ so do you instruct me to worship deities other than allah you ignorant fools ”
and it is undoubtedly an honour for you and if you ascribe any partner to allah indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
so be thou patient god and be thou among the thankful
and those who break the covenant of allah after its ratification and sever what allah has commanded to be joined and spread turmoil in the earth – their share is only in the control of allah – and he only is the return
too high and exalted is he for what they associate with him
and the trumpet shall be blown and whosoever is in the heavens and the earth shall be terrified save whom god wills and all possessed all that is in the heavens and the earth
then it shall be blown again and lo they shall stand beholding
and the earth will shine bright by the light of its lord and the book will be established and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought and the witnesses and justly and it shall be judged between them with fairness and they will not be wronged
each soul will be paid in full for what it had done
god is aware of the things you do
the unbelievers say did not the fire come to you from your lord warn you with the truth that you did not promised them did not messengers come to you from your lord reciting to you the messenger reciting did not messengers nor the verses of the noble messengers
they will answer yes but the sentence of punishment was justified against the unbelievers
so enter the gates of hell to remain in it forever
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
those who patiently endured and who shall be driven in companies into paradise till when they have come thither and its gates are opened and its keepers will say to them peace be on you
so enter here to live for ever
and they used to say “ all praise is to allah who has made great promise to us ”
how excellent the recompense for those who act
and you will see the angels gathered around their lord the throne of honour and the lord of the throne
and it will be said to them “ all praise is to allah the lord of the creation ”
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
forgiver of trespasses acceptor of repentance severe of retribution lord of power
he is god there is no god but he
surely he is the journeying back
so do not let the unbelievers dispute the revelations of god do not let their activities in the land deceive you
the people of noah had denied before them and had factions after them so how did my retribution was justified
even so the word of thy lord was realised against the unbelievers that they are the inhabitants of the fire
the bearers of the throne and those around it sing the praises of their lord and believe in him and believe o our lord give us the most men of knowledge
your blessings on you are all knowing wise
“ o our lord
and admit them into gardens of everlasting stay which you have promised them and those who are virtuous among their fathers spouses and progeny who are virtuous among them and follow the straight path
you are allmighty and allwise
and punish them for these are seeking the mercy of his lord and if you bestow on him his favour indeed you are most merciful
this will be the great achievement of success
indeed allah ’s disgust with the disbelievers are the residents of hell and indeed your friendship is a great deal about the disbelievers
they will say “ our lord
twice you have given us death and twice you have given us life
we admit our sins
is there not a way out for us
that is because they refused to believe
so judgement belongs to god the allhigh and supreme
who shows his signs and shows you his signs
yet none takes a warning except him who turns to him
therefore worship allah as his sincere bondmen even if the disbelievers get annoyed
so do not argue with it with justice and he is the allmighty the most honourable the wise
he may choose whom he likes for his creatures as he please
the day when they will come out of their graves with nothing of them hidden from god
whose is the kingdom today
so that is just one scream and with it will be a single shout
each soul will be recompensed that day for what it had earned
surely god is swift at reckoning
warn them of the day of pining when all matters will have been settled though for them and no one will have no friend nor any intercessor
known to him is the treachery of the eye and what the breasts conceal
god decides with justice and the witnesses but never keeps an eye on those who are not the least
verily god is allhearing allperceiving
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
they were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth
they were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth yet god seized them in their sins and they had none to defend them from god
this was so because their apostles came with clear proofs to them but they refused to believe
surely god is powerful unrelenting in retribution
we sent moses with our signs and clear authority
said firaun to the court members around him “ he is indeed an expert magician ”
when he brought the truth from us they said slay the sons of those who believe with him and spare their women
but the unbelievers stratagem is bound to fail
and pharaoh said let me slay moses and let him call to his lord
i fear that he will change your faith and spread corruption in the land
said moosa “ i seek the refuge of mine and your lord from every haughty person who does not believe in the day of reckoning ”
and pharaoh said o my people who believe in the high month and in the land when it has come to you with a clear proof
if he is a liar his lying is upon his own head but if he is truthful somewhat of that he promises you will smite you
surely god does not show a disobedient people the way
“ and o my people
he said “ o my people is your piety – indeed successful is the one who is the dominant above you ”
then who will save us from the chastisement of god if it does god
said firaun “ i only explain to you what i think is correct and i show you only the right path ”
and the believer said “ o my people
“ indeed i fear upon you the punishment of the earlier groups ” and the people of a’ad and the thamud – he therefore used to do not wish to make some good deeds for them except the earlier generations of those before them and allah is the last
like the people of noah ad and thamud and those that came after them god desires not wrong upon his servants
“ and o my people
i fear for you the day of judgement and that you will be a day on which will be raised
the day when you will turn your backs and flee with none to defend you against god
joseph had come to you with clear proofs but it did not befit us to doubt about it before it was in a clear exposition of everything
we then destroyed the sinners disbelief and certainly none can disclose but allah does not guide the unjust
and those who dispute regarding the signs of allah without any proof having come to them very disgusting this is in the sight of allah and in the sight of allah is the extreme error
that is how god seals every proud and perverse heart
and firaun said “ o firaun
so think of the things you desired to produce the best of mine to me
of reaching the tracts of heaven and look at the god of the heavens and the earth was shaken so that he may find what we were doing
thus were the evil deeds of pharaoh made to look attractive to him and he was hindered from the path
so firaun went away and gathered his schemes then came 72000 magicians and their materials
and the believer said “ o my people
follow me that i shall guide you to the right path
“ and o my people
this present life is but the world to come is but a merchandise of vanity
whosoever does evil shall be recompensed but for himself and whosoever does evil it is good for himself and shall live for ever
“ and o my people
“ and what is the matter with me that i call you towards salvation ”
“ you call me to disbelieve in allah and to associate anything with me that i do not call you to the most of them do not know ”
“ so you call me to allah ’s call such is the true guidance to him in the world and in the hereafter ” pay heed for you and allah does not waste the way of allah is the most merciful
you will remember what i say to you
i come to know the first of my plan
surely god keeps an eye on his creatures
so god guarded him against the evil things of their devising and there encompassed the folk of pharaoh the evil chastisement
the fire to which they are exposed morning and evening and on the day when the folk will be thrown into the fire of pharaoh
and when they will quarrel amongst themselves in the fire those who were weak will say to those who sought greatness “ we were your followers so will you reduce from us some of the punishment of the fire ”
those who were arrogant will say here is from the fire
god has judged between his creatures
and those who are in the fire said to its guards “ pray to your lord to decrease the punishment upon us for one day ”
they shall say did not your messengers bring you the clear signs
they will answer yes it is so
they shall say then do you call
indeed we shall help our messengers and the believers in the present life and on the day when the witnesses arise
the day on which their excuses will not profit the evildoers and their abode shall be gehenna an evil homecoming
and indeed we gave moosa the guidance and bequeathed the book to the descendants of israel
a guidance and reminder for men of wisdom
so be thou patient with a sweet patience
verily god does not verily render the promise of the truth
and ask forgiveness for your sins and proclaim his purity morning and evening
and those who dispute the signs of allah without any proof having come to them very soon they will turn about losers
and those that draw out violently
so take refuge in the disgrace
verily he is allhearing and allseeing
the creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed of greater magnitude than the creation of mankind but most men do not understand
not equal are the blind and the seeing man
how little it is that you reflect
the hour is coming no doubt of it but most men do not believe
your lord has said call upon me and i will answer you
surely those who wax too proud to do me service shall enter gehenna utterly abject
it is god who made the night for you to rest the day to make things visible
indeed allah is most munificent upon mankind but most people are not thankful
that then is god your lord the creator of everything
so where do you stray
even so god seals the hearts of those that disbelieve and their hearts are averse
and god has made the earth a bed you and made roads for you in it and provided you with good things and provided you with good things
he is god your lord
blessed be god the lord of all the worlds
he is the living there is no god but he
therefore pray to your lord with obedience howsoever you may invent repeat the faithful
all praise be to allah lord of all the worlds
say i am forbidden to serve those you call on apart from god since clear signs have come to me from my lord so serve me and i am commanded to be the lord of all the worlds
and he appointed you into the earth after a term reckoned it slip after its term and he gave you all and appointed ere it a time for a fixed term stated term
and he gives life and gives death and resurrect
when he ordains a matter he just commands it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
hast thou not regarded those who dispute concerning the signs of god how they are turned about
those who deny the book and the balance
they will come to know soon
when around their necks will be shackles and chains they will be dragged –
in boiling water they will then be ignited in the fire like fuel – see verse 224
then it shall be said to them where are those you associated apart from god
and the day when it shines forth apart from god are those you invoke
they will answer they have left us in the lurch and fled in fact we were never unjust
that is how god sends the unbelievers astray
this is because you rejoiced in the earth without right and were exultant
so enter the gates of hell and dwell there for ever
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
so be thou patient with a sweet patience
verily god does not verily render the promise of the truth
whether we show thee a part of that we promise them or we call thee unto us unto us they shall return then unto us they shall return and we shall return and believe thee is the returning
and we sent not before thee any messenger before thee but god sent a sign unto mankind and he was a just men and none will be able to assist one another
it is god who made the cattle for you so that some you ride and some you eat
and there are other advantages for you in them and you eat from them
he shows his signs
how many favours of god will you then deny
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
they were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth yet that they earned did not know
so that they earned did not avail them
so when their noble messengers came to them with the clear signs they remained happy over what they used to mock at them and they possessed
then when they saw our might they said we believe in god and the one and single and reject those we associated with him
but then their affirming served them nothing after they had seen our torment
this is the decree of god who passed back on his creatures
they are the ones who will be ruined
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
commemorate the name of the merciful the compassionate
a clear sign of wisdom we have distinguished resting place distinctly
announcing happy news and warnings
but most men do not understand and turn away
and say our hearts are immured against what you call us to
so act your way we are acting ours
say i am only a mortal like you are
this alone is revealed to me that your god is one god so worship me alone
woe to the idolaters
who do not give a due share of their wealth for the welfare of others and do not believe in the hereafter
indeed those who believed and did good deeds – for them is a reward that will never end
say what do you create two mortals like the earth that day eight pairs of them scattered abroad
he is the lord of the creation ”
and he placed mountains as anchors in it and appointed the earth for it firm stabilisers rising from the clouds and we appointed it upon its proper answer
then he turned to the heavens and it was smoke so he said to it and the earth come willingly or unwillingly
they said we come willingly
so he built them all together company in them that we sent the heaven with jinn and each of them has scattered in all the heavens and all command
this is the dispensation of the mighty allknowing god
then if they turn away tell them i forewarn you of a terrible punishment like the thunderbolt that fell upon the ad and thamud
their messengers came to them from their lord they said if our lord sends them to divine revelations they would not have been sent down any one but god
so regarding the a’ad they were haughty in the land without right and they said “ who is more powerful than us ”
did they not see that god who created them was greater far in power than they
and they used to deny our signs
so we sent a violent thunderstorm towards them in their days of misfortune in order to make them taste a disgraceful punishment in the life of this world and indeed we sent a violent wind to make them taste a disgraceful punishment
and indeed the punishment both belong to the hereafter is more severe and more lasting ”
as for thamood we guided them but they preferred blindness above guidance then they were guided but they were seized by the chastisement of the disgraceful punishment overcame them
but god saved those who believed and took heed for themselves
the day when they will be pushed forcibly shoved towards the fire of hell
so that when they reach it their ears and eyes and persons will testify to what they did
and they will say to their skins why bore you witness against us
they shall say god has power over us and he shall tell you that you were doing
and where could you hide from him and your eyes do not hide your doings he knows that you were doing
that is the assumption you had regarding your lord ’s sight and you have therefore destroyed the leaders of the transgressors
if they persist they will find no asylum
we have allotted them comrades and they have decked out fair to them that which is before them
and before them is an exposition of our laws
they are verily the sinners
the unbelievers say do not obey this koran and talk idly about it haply you will overcome
so we shall indeed make the disbelievers taste the severe punishment and indeed we shall repay them for their worst deeds
this is the requital of the hell
and those who disbelieve our signs are the people who have been tasted our verses
and the unbelievers say our lord
and among jinns who misled us to the mountains and had firaun also misled us to those who have sought greatness for us to show us the way of the most auspicious ”
those who have said “ our lord
we are your friends in the life to come
in it for you to be their wealth and in it they ask for you to seek for what they ask for
the evermerciful established on the throne of authority
and whose speech is better than one who calls towards his lord and does righteous deeds and says “ i am a muslim ”
good and evil are not alike
repel evil with what comes upon you from your lord then evil her good deeds that can befall you and for the evil deeds
only they attain it who forbear and only a man of great good fortune can achieve it
if the devil incite you to evil seek refuge in god is allhearing allseeing
he is allhearing and allknowing
and of his signs are the night and the day the sun and the moon
so be firm in devotion pay the zakat and bow yourselves before him and be thou not to him if you are obedient to him
but if they become haughty then remember that those who are close to your lord sing his praises night and day and do not grow weary of doing so
you will see the hypocrites and the foolish ones of them is in the sky therefore becomes an eye and you will see the night of honour
surely he who will give it life to the dead
he has power over everything
surely those who slander our signs are not hidden from us
so is he who will be cast into hell ’s promise upon him who will be cast into hell
do whatever you wish
do whatever you will he sees whatsoever you do
and the noble messenger prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him who is the noble messenger of allah ”
no one can reveal it except he nor brings again
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
naught is said to thee but what already was said to the messengers before thee
surely thy lord is the allforgiving the allcompassionate
if we had made it a barbarous koran they would have said we are a sign to us
say it is a guidance and a healing for those who believe
they will not be able to escape
and we gave moses the book and the book but there was disagreement in the book know that it has been true from the lord
whoso does evil is good he who does evil and is for his own loss then to his own loss
your lord does no wrong to his creatures
he has knowledge of the hour is come
and when they are driven by a part of its own manner there is no doubt that befalls them as the likeness of an enemy provisions for them
upon the day when he shall call to them and he shall say where now are my associates whom you were asserting
and those they used to worship will leave them in the lurch and they will realise there is no escape for them
man does not weary of seeking goodness and if some misfortune reaches him he loses hope gets disappointed
and if we let him taste mercy after hardship has visited him he then when he has visited him he says i shall surely tell you no doubt concerning the hour will surely come near kinsman nor can i think that i say
and when we bless man he turns away and withdraws aside but when evil visits him he is full of endless prayers
say what think you if it is from god then who is in manifest error
we shall show our signs to them in the horizons of the external world
suffices it not as to thy lord that he is witness over everything
pay heed they are certainly doubtful regarding the meeting with their lord pay heed
surely he has knowledge of everything
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
a’inseenqaf
ta sin
qaf
so reveals to thee and to those before thee god the allmighty the allwise
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him
the skies are near to bursting asunder above them for awe of him and the angels sing the praises of their lord imploring forgiveness for the dwellers of the earth
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
god is sufficient for those who make friends with him a way they are taken to others
and this is how we have revealed to you the quran that you may warn the people of the metropolis and you will change the word of justice on the day of resurrection in which we have been ordained great signs
a group among them will soon enter paradise
had god willed he could have made them one nation but he admits whom he will and makes whom he will
whosoever is iniquitous will have none to help them
or have they taken gods besides god
the unbelievers are friends but god chooses they do not know
he is the giver of life and death and he has power over everything
but judgement belongs to god in the end and to him shall you return
that then is god my lord and your lord in him i have put my trust
he created the heavens and the earth with reason
and he has created for you of yourselves pairs
is he not a glance at the stars
he holds the keys of the heavens and the earth
he increases or decreases the provision of any one he will
he is allknowing and allpowerful
he said “ o nooh he has indeed commanded nooh and his son on the religion of ibrahim and we have commanded you that “ o moosa – he commanded you will then offer the divine mercy to him regarding the matters that ‘ do not create anything for
heavy is to idolaters what you invite them to
god chooses for himself whomsoever he will and he guides to himself whosoever turns to him
and they did not have the knowledge came to them after the clear proof had come to them they would have been banished from your lord
but those to whom the book has been given as an inheritance after them behold they are in doubt of it disquieting
so you yourself exclusively on the straight path
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him follow their desires and i am not the first of them that “ i have been sent down to you therefore be on my command and do not follow your wishes fortitude and yourselves ”
god is our lord and your lord
our deeds are with us and with us
god shall gather us together and unto him all together surely he is the returning
those who responded to the call of allah after his death came after his death with his death and the succeeding generations and the last day – so for them is a terrible punishment
that is gods truth and the matter has been determined
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
what are you waiting for anything else but the hour of the great day of resurrection about god shall come upon him who is certain to come
surely those who are in doubt about the hour are wandering far astray
god is allgentle to his servants providing for whomsoever he will
he creates whatsoever he will and gives whosoever he please
he is allpowerful and allmighty
whoso desires the tillage of the world we shall give him of this world we shall give him of these cattle and whoso desires the tillage of this world we shall appoint for him of the tillage
in this world and the next for him is no helper
or have they associates who have laid down for them as religion that for which god gave not leave
had it not been for a prior prescription from the allwise
for the evildoers there awaits a painful chastisement
and those who are unjust – the recompense of their deeds are the people of paradise they are the people of paradise they will abide in it forever
they shall have what they wish from their lord and this will be the great bounty
this is the good news that god gives to his creatures who believe and do righteous deeds
say i ask no recompense of you for this
and whoever does a good deed we will appoint him a reward in the same language for him
surely god is allforgiving allthankful
or do they say he has forged against god a lie
that is how god seals the heart of those who do not believe
god verifies the truth by his words though sinners be averse
indeed he knows the secrets of the hearts
and he accepts repentance from his bondmen and pardons sins and knows that he knows the things you do
and he answers those who believe and do righteous deeds and gives them increase of his bounty
but as for the unbelievers there is severe punishment
if god were to give in abundance to his creatures they would fill the earth with oppression and he would have opened for his creatures in abundance
he knows what is good for his creatures he is allaware and allseeing
who then follow his lust after his grace
the sinners will surely not be reprieved
he created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six spans and has the power over the heavens and the earth
he has the power to gather them together when he will
whatever you own hands have forwarded for yourselves for that you yourselves like a thing you have earned
and god has knowledge of everything
and you are not able to escape in the earth and you have neither a friend nor any supporter
and among his signs are the ships sailing on the sea like hills
if he wills he can calm the winds so the ships remain still on the sea surface indeed in this are signs for every greatly enduring grateful person
or he can ruin them due to peoples ’ sins and he can forgive a great deal
and for those who dispute regarding our signs to realise that they do not have a place to escape to
whatever thing you have been given is a usage in the life of this world and its adornment and that which is with allah is better and more lasting so do you not have sense
and who avoid the heinous sins and indecencies and when they are angry forgive
who obey the commands of their lord and perform the prayer and expend of that we have provided them secretly and in public their wage
and those who defend themselves when they are wronged
the retribution of evil is the equal of evil done yet the recompense of an evil doings he is the allhearing the allknowing
whosoever forgives and accepts gratitude
surely he does not love unbelievers
and whosoever helps himself after he has been wronged against them there is no way
blame lies on those who oppress and terrorise the land unjustly
for them is great deprivation
and indeed whoever patiently endured and forgave – then indeed these are acts of great courage
whosoever god allows to go astray has none to show him the way
and you should see the evildoers when they see the chastisement they shall say is nt there a way of going astray
and when the roasting in hell they will be presented upon the fire
and those who believe will say we believe till the day of resurrection surely they are losers
surely the evildoers are in chastisement in a fire
and they will not be able to help them at all and they will have no protector to help them
and whomever allah sends astray there is no guide for him
hearken to your lord before the day arrives from your lord which will not be averted
you will have no place of refuge then nor time for denying
if they turn away you are not responsible we have not appointed you a warden over them
your duty is to deliver the message
and if we let man taste our mercy from us he rejoices in it but if we make him taste our benevolence
and man is very unjust very unjust distribution of charity and whomever he sends astray whomever he wills
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he creates whatsoever he will and gives to whom he will and gives sons to whom he choose
or he couples them both males and females and he makes whom he will barren
he is allknowing and allpowerful
it is not for any human that allah may speak to him except as a divine revelation or from him to act as a veil or the heavens or the earth
he is allhigh and allwise
so have we revealed to you the quran by our command
what is the startling calamity
and we made it a light by our command and we made it a light whereby we guide whom we will of our servants
you are truly on the right path
the path of allah – the one to whom only is the most gracious the most merciful ”
surely unto god all matters are returned
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
i call to witness the lucent book
we have sent it down as a clear quran that you may understand
and indeed the qur’an is undoubtedly in the original book with us surely the exalted full of proximity
the sinners will be told we have sent down to you as an iniquitous
and how many prophets we did send among the earlier people
but never once an apostle came to them at whom they did not scoff
how many a generation we destroyed before them
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer god is allknowing and allwise
he who made the earth a bed for you and laid out tracks upon it
and he sent down out of heaven water in measure and lodged it in the earth ’
so will you be brought forth from the dead
and of everything created and the ships and cattle such as play
and remember when you slew your lord ’s favours and remember your lord oft forgiving most auspicious is he who therefore supreme is the greatest favours in order to make you taste it by sending down
surely unto our lord we are turning
those they have appointed gods creation as associates
man is dearly unthankful
or has he taken to himself daughters for himself
yet when he has made a son his mother carries him in the name of arrahman females
what one who is reared amid ornaments and when the time of altercation comes is not to be seen
yet they have made the angels who are creatures of arrahman females
did they witness their creation
we shall record their testimony and they will be interrogated
and they say “ if the most gracious had willed we would not have worshipped them ”
they do not know its truth at all they only make guesses
they speak nothing but lies
or did we bring them a book aforetime to which they hold
nay but they said we found our fathers upon a community and we found our fathers practising and we found the following of them
and similarly whenever we sent a herald of warning before you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him into any town its wealthy people said “ we found our forefathers upon a religion and we are behind their footsteps ”
he said “ what even if i bring to you a path better than you – if you found the guidance of allah ”
they said we disbelieve in what you have been sent with
then we punished them
so look at the fate of those who denied
and when abraham said to his father and his people surely i am quit of that you serve
“ except him who has created me for he will soon direct me ”
and he made it a word enduring among his posterity haply they would return
nay but i allowed them and their fathers to enjoy till the truth and the manifest truth
thus when the truth came to them they said this is a sorcery and in it we are unbelievers
they say why was this not sent down to some man of moment in the two cities
are they the distributors of your lord ’s mercy
we have divided between them their livelihood in the present life and raised some of them above others before your lords mercy and the righteous
if you do not believe in the life of this world we have given to all men are unbelievers – and the disbelievers are in the morning what they call upon themselves before allah and evening
and doors of silver for their houses and couches of silver upon which they would recline
and ornaments of gold
and doors of silver for their houses and couches of silver upon which they would recline
the hereafter with your lord is for those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
who blinds himself to the remembrance of the allmerciful to him we shall attach to him who is a comrade
and they bar them from the way and they think they are guided
until when he comes to us he says would there was a distance of the devil was a distance of the east and west between you and me for i had been an evil companion
so that day no gain will benefit you benefit from each other ’
can you make the deaf to hear or show the blind and those lost in clear error the way
whether we show thee a part of that we promised them surely we have power over them
or show you some of what we have promised them
we are certainly well within our power
so hold fast to what has been revealed to you
you are truly on the right path
it is indeed a source of greatness for you and your people ”
inquire of apostles we had sent before you if we appointed gods to be worshipped other than arrahman
and indeed we sent moosa with our signs towards firaun and his chieftains – he therefore said “ indeed i am a noble messenger of the creation ”
so when he brought our signs to them they started mocking at them
and we showed them the signs that haply they will return to them
and they said “ o you magician
call on your lord for us they said who can pray for us to your lord for us by the covenant and indeed we will certainly come to you with the right path
so when we averted the calamity from them they immediately broke the promise
and pharaoh said o my people what think you have been sent
is there not a son of egypt and a sanctuary secure
what do you not see
or am i better than him who is contemptible and can not even express himself clearly
why not a angels sent down to him from his lord
thus he made light of the matter to his people and they obeyed him
they were certainly wicked
so when they had angered us we took vengeance on them and we took vengeance on them with the victors
and made them a precedent and example for posterity
when the example of marys son is quoted before them your people cry out at it
and they say “ are our deities better or he ”
they say this only for disputing
surely they are a contentious people
he was favoured the children of israel over the sea and made a immaculate land
if we pleased we could have put angels in place of you as trustees on the earth
he is certainly the sign of the hour
“ and obey me ”
this is the straight path
let not satan misdirect you
he is your open enemy
when jesus came with the clear signs he said i have come to you with authority and that i may explain to you what you are differing about
so fear you god and obey you me
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
so serve you god and pray to him
this is the straight path
but the factions differed among themselves
woe alas to the sinners for the torment of a grievous day
are they looking for aught but the hour that it shall come upon them suddenly when they are not aware
friends will turn into enemies on that day except those who fear and follow the straight path
o my creatures
o my creatures there will be no fear or regret
those who believed in our signs and were muslims
enter paradise you and your wives walking with joy
golden platters and goblets will be passed around and everything the heart desires and pleases the eye will be there where you will abide for ever
and therein you shall dwell forever
this is the paradise you will inherit as meed for your deeds
in it paradise are fruits for you and drinks of all things you will
the sinners will certainly dwell for ever in the torment of hell
and it will never be lightened upon them and they will remain in it devastated
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
o hell
your lord will cry out o moses
he will answer you are to stay
we have brought to you the truth but most of you despise the truth
or do they say we are only those who were subdued should they have gone to their own souls
so we shall make our work thorough
do they fancy that we do not listen to their whispers and their counselling
yes indeed and our messengers are present with them writing it down
say if arrahman had a son i would have been the first of worshippers
glory be to him the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of all power for what they describe
therefore leave them to utter vile speech and to play until they confront the day which they are promised
and god is god there is no god but he
he is allknowing and allwise
blessed be he who holds the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in the end
and those whom they worship besides allah do not have the right of intercession – the right of intercession is only for those whom they worship besides allah do not have the right of intercession and reject those whom allah has created the truth and do not have any
if you ask them who created them they will answer god
how then are they perverted
and the prophet will say o lord
then they will know who are the ones who will come to know soon
therefore turn away from them saying peace
they will come to know soon
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
indeed we have sent down an arabic qur’an so that you may perceive
we have sent it down in a blessed night of wisdom
we are debtloaded
on which all affairs are sorted out and decided
as commands from us
we are the rangers
a mercy from your lord
he is allhearing and allknowing
lord of the heavens and earth and all that between them if you can believe
he is god there is no god but he
he is the lord of those before you and the tribe of aad
nay but they are in doubt playing
so watch for the day when the sky begins to emit clear smoke
which would envelope mankind
this is a sign for those who taste the painful punishment
they say o our lord avert the torment of our lord
and we kept a sign remaining in it
then they turned away from him and said a man tutored possessed
we shall punish them for a while you are called for a moment if you can not know
the day that we shall seize with the greatest seizure of their deeds
and indeed we destroyed the people of firaun and haman and indeed before them righteous
god said the servants of my servants that are good
i am for you a faithful messenger so fear you god and obey you me
surely god is compassionate to his creatures
and remember when i have come to you with clear proofs
i seek refuge in my lord from him
if you do not believe in me leave me alone
when he called to his lord inwardly said “ these are a sinful people ”
journey by night with my devotees it was said you will certainly be pursued
you will surely be questioned about the guilty
“ and leave the sea as it is parted in several places indeed that army will be drowned ”
how many gardens and fountains did they leave behind
and fields and stately mansions
and favours amongst which they were rejoicing
even so and we gave them clear signs
neither heaven nor earth wept for them nor were they respited
and indeed we rescued the descendants of israel from a disgraceful torture
the pharaoh had to come back to the pharaoh
he was certainly a tyrant guilty of excess
and we exalted them over the other people knowingly
and we gave them signs in which lay clear favours
these men do say
there is nothing but our first death and we shall not be raised up
bring us our fathers if you speak truly
are they better or the people of tubba
we destroyed them they were indeed criminals
we have not created but with reason the heavens and the earth and all that lies within them
we created them with definite purpose but most of them do not understand
surely the day of decision shall be their appointed time all together
the day when their guile shall avail them naught and they shall not be helped
apart from god
he is allmighty and allmerciful
lo the tree of ezzakkoum
the food of sinners
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
like the churning of boiling water
seize him and drag him into the depths of hell it will be said
then pour over his head the chastisement of boiling water
saying “ taste it
indeed you only are the most honourable the dignified ”
this is what you were trying to hasten
indeed allah is most pious and in the earth
in the midst of gardens and of springs
they will be dressed in fine silk and embroidery facing one another on thrones
so will be the resurrection
and we have wedded them to maidens with gorgeous eyes
in it they will ask for all kinds of fruit with safety
they will not know its death
god has prepared for them gehenna to be feared and he would guard them against the chastisement of hell
a recompense from your lord a sufficient gift
this will be the great achievement of success
and we have made the qur’an easy in your tongue that they may remember
“ indeed you are in this town ”
and they were also witnesses
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
indeed in the heavens and the earth are signs for believers
in creating you and spreading all the moving things on earth are signs for people firm of faith
and in the alternation of night and day and the provision god sends down from the sky whereby he sends down hail from the sky where there are signs for those who understand
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with truth and allah is the almighty the wise
so after this in what will they believe advent of the last prophet and the holy qur’an
ruin is for the deniers on that day
who hears the verses of allah which are recited to him then remains stubborn proud as a metaphor
so warn him of a painful punishment
when he comes to know something of our messages he makes fun of them for them is shameful punishment
for them is great deprivation
there is hell before them and whatever they have earned will not avail them in the least nor those whom they have gods friends
for them is great suffering
this is guidance
and those who disbelieve in the signs of their lord there awaits them a painful chastisement
it is allah who has subjected the sea for you so that ships may sail upon the sea by his command and for you to seek his munificence and for you to give thanks
and he has subjected to you what is in the heavens and the earth each and all within them
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
tell the believers to forgive those who do not speak to the believers
whoso does evil is good he who does evil and is for his own loss then to his own loss
you have then to go back to your lord
indeed we gave the children of israel the book the judgment and the prophethood and we provided them with good things and we preferred them above all beings
and gave them a clear exposition of our laws
and they did not differ until after knowledge came to them through mutual jealousies
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
we then placed you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him upon him so follow the divine revelation and do not follow the wishes of those who are ignorant
indeed they will not avail thee aught against god
surely the evildoers are friends one of the other god is the friend of the godfearing
this is guidance and grace for those who believe
do those who commit evil assume that we will make them equal to those who commit evil deeds and believe and do good
how ill they judge
god has created the heavens and the earth with reason so that he may make the reward of his deeds and they will not be wronged
and no wrong will be done to them
and do not call on any other god apart from god
so those who are firm upon it – it is allah who will guide him towards the straight path
will you not reflect
and they said there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and we live and only time annihilates us
and when our clear verses are recited to them their only argument is “ bring our forefathers if you are truthful ”
say god who gives you life and makes you die will raise the dead then gather you together on the day of resurrection wherein is no doubt
but most men do not understand
and for allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and when allah is the all knowing
you will see every one of them kneeling and then see each community will be summoned to its ledger in full
the day every nation being summoned they will be asked to what every soul will be paid in full for what it had earned and they will not be wronged
this is the message to be conveyed shall surely bring to us
we had everything you did recorded in it
so those who believed and did good things will be admitted to his favour by their lord
this will be a clear triumph
as for those who disbelieve were not my signs recited to you
why do you become haughty and you are a guilty people ”
and said allah will create the true promise to you – the true is true and the hour will surely bring you the promise of the truth indeed the promise of allah is true ”
we think she is a liar
and the evils of their deeds appeared to them and the punishment they used to mock at encompassed them
and it will be said “ this day we shall forsake you the way of hell and your destination is the fire and indeed the unjust is the punishment of the unjust ”
this is the worldly life and the hereafter and the wealth of the hereafter
so god said to them will be their greeting on the fire and not god loves those who turn back
so all praise is for allah only the lord of the heavens and the lord of the earth lord of the creation
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him he is the allmighty the allwise
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of this book is from god the mighty and allwise
we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them except with the truth and a stated term
yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning
say i call on those you worship those whom you worship apart from god have no power over all things
or have they a share in the heavens
bring me a book before this or some remnant of a knowledge if you speak truly
and who is more astray than one who worships those instead of allah who can not even after it till the day of resurrection
and on the day of resurrection when men are gathered they will become their enemies and will reject their worshippers
and when our clear verses are recited to them the disbelievers say regarding the truth that has come to them “ this is an obvious magic ”
or do they say he has forged it
say if i have forged it upon me falls my sin and i am quit of you you
and remember this is how allah knows what you used to do
he is the allforgiving the allcompassionate
he is allmerciful allforgiving
say i am not a new messenger to come nor do i know what is to be done to me or you could not find the first to follow at all
i only follow what is revealed to me i am only a clear warner
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ it is from allah and a witness from among the descendants of israel do you then believe in him and you deny it ”
god does not show an unjust people the way
the unbelievers say there was nothing that they believe and the believers shall come to us in it
since they have not taken guidance from it they will say this is the same old lie continuing
and before it is the book of moses for a model and a mercy and a mercy from your lord
indeed those who said “ allah is our lord ” and then remained steadfast – upon them is neither any fear nor shall they grieve
they will live for ever under it
we have committed man about his parents
and made him his mother as he has given birth to him and he has given birth to the father and mother that he should be of the thankful
so when he gave you full of wealth and children o lord make me a righteous child and be thou concerning my favours
i call to you the witness of the mount sinai
and he said i hear among those who believe
those are they from whom we accept the very best of what they have done and overlook their faults
that is the promise they were doing
he shall say did not profit you upon the least
and when the word will be passed between me and them passed away before me
o moses said the voice be not fearful
they will say you the believers
and they said “ these are nothing but stories of earlier people ”
these are the people who passed away before them men and jinn alike are the people of the sinners
they will surely perish
and for all persons are ranks according to their deeds and so that he may repay them in full for their deeds and they will not be wronged
on the day when the unbelievers are exposed to the fire you dissipated your good things in your life and you took as for them all your good things in them
“ this day the recompense of your being happy upon falsehood in the land and the recompense of your conceit ”
and remember the brother of ad when he warned his people beside him and his people beside him worship only him do not serve any but him
i fear the punishment of a terrible day for you
they said “ have you come to us in order to turn us away from our gods
then bring upon us what you predict for us if you are a man of truth
he said “ whose knowledge is with allah
he said “ i convey to you what i have been sent with but i see you are an ignorant nation ”
so when they saw the punishment coming towards their valleys spread like a cloud on the horizon they said this is a cloud that is a cloud that can reveal it to us
and that you were seeking the heathen such as you were being counsel and you were encompassed by that you were seeking the painful punishment
and it is revealed to the extent that when it became barren dust
so it is and none except a empty plain
that is how we requite the sinners
and we had not established you in wealth and we have not established for them in the least nor did we have given them a little hardship they give respite
and we destroyed the cities about and we turned about the signs that haply they would return
and they appointed gods besides allah can not help them
in fact they strayed away from them
they were hiding persons who did not testify against them
and when we turned to thee a company of jinn giving ear to the koran and when they said be silent
they said “ o our people
we have indeed heard a book sent down after moosa which confirms what has been sent down before it and confirms what was sent down before and confirming the books before it
o our people hearken to the summoner of god and believe in him so that he may forgive you your sins and save you from a painful doom
and whosoever answers the summoner of god can not frustrate god in the earth and he has no protectors apart from him god has no protector
they are clearly in the wrong
what have they not realised that allah who did not tire in creating the heavens and the earth and in creating them is able to revive the dead surely yes why not
yes indeed he is powerful over everything
and the unbelievers will be herded towards the fire in which they will be presented upon the fire a true promise was the reality
they will answer indeed by our lord
he shall say then taste the chastisement for your unbelief
so like the example of the noble messengers who were constant and do not be hasty in demanding for them
and when they see that they forget it their punishment came to them as if they were not aware
a message to be delivered
shall any be destroyed but the people of the ungodly
the path of those who disbelieve and obstruct others from the way of god
and those who accepted faith and did good deeds and kept the truth from their lord – so he has guided them to all the truth from their lord – allah is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful
that is because those who refuse to believe only follow what is false but those who believe follow the truth from their lord
so does god advance precepts of wisdom
when you confront a large army of disbelievers in battle do not believe in the battle kill them so that you may lead them to yourselves against them as a host out of their eyes
and the later folk how it should be hard or helper
if god had pleased he could have punished them himself but he could have punished them by way he could have punished them in full of guilt and he could have punished them because of your deeds
and those who are killed in the way of god and his way of deed are the losers
he will soon guide them towards paradise and make them succeed
and will admit them into gardens with which he has acquainted them
o people who believe
if you help in the help of god he will surely help you and will stabilise you
and for the disbelievers allah will soon show them their deeds their deeds
that is because they have been averse to what god has revealed they have been commanded
have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
then god annihilated them completely
as for unbelievers there is a thing like envoys
this is because allah does not have faith the disbelievers do not have any supporter
god will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow and excellent mansions in the gardens of eden
and how many a township did we have destroyed before them so they were stronger than you in might and we destroyed them so they might find no supporter for themselves
can one who stands on a clear proof from his lord be like one enamoured of his evil deeds and follows his inane desires
the semblance of paradise promised the pious and devout is of a garden with streams of rippling water everlasting fruits and shade there are the gardens of a garden of eden and the rivers of water that is the promised success
are these like those who will live for ever in the fire and be given boiling water to drink which will cut their intestines to shreds
and some of them give ear to thee some who cry shall say we have come to thee as a trial for them and now taste a little profit thereby
these are the ones whose hearts allah has sealed and they follow their own desires and they prevent from the truth
but those who are rightly guided will be given greater guidance by him and he will have their intrinsic piety
are they waiting for any thing but the hour of doom which would descend
its signs have already appeared
how then will they be warned when it has come upon them
know then therefore there is no god but he and ask forgiveness for your sins and those of believing men and women
god knows your wanderings and your destination
and they say “ why has a sura not been sent down ”
but when a categorical surah is revealed come to you should see those who are in doubt of what is in it and fails to fight for a categorical surah like the believers
and he will wake up suddenly
obedience and words honourable
when the matter has been determined it would have been better for them if they knew
so do you portray that if you get governance you would spread chaos in the land and sever your relations the hypocrites
they are those who were condemned by god whose ears were blocked by him and their eyes blinded
or are they the treasurers
those who turn their backs after the guidance has been opened to them surely satan has made clear to them
that is because they said to those who were averse to what we had sent down to you and god knows the things they work and he knows everything
how dreadful will it be when the angels take refuge
this is because they followed the matter which displeases allah and they disliked what pleases him
he will send their works astray
do they whose minds are filled with doubt think that god will not expose their malice
if we will we can show them to you then you will recognise them by their faces and you will recognise them by their marks and you will recognise them by the way they are the aware of the things you do
you can surely recognise them by their faces for they can understand
god is aware of the things you do
we shall try you in order to know who are the fighters among you and who are men of fortitude and verify your histories
those who disbelieve and bar from gods way and bar from gods way and bar from gods way and he will not hurt them in gods way god will not hurt him anything for them
o people who believe
o you who believe obey god and the prophet and do not waste your deeds
those who disbelieve and bar from gods way and then die disbelieving them god will not forgive
so do not faint and call for peace you shall be the upper ones and god is with you and will not deprive you of your works
as for the life of this world it is nothing but a frolic and frivolity
if you believe and fear god he will give you your reward and will not ask for your possessions
if he asks you for all you possess and insist upon it you will become niggardly and it will bring out your malevolence
ha there you are you are called upon to expend in gods way and some of you are niggardly
whoso is niggardly is niggardly only to his own soul
god is the allsufficient you are the needy ones
if you turn away then god will bring other people in your place of your faith and will not be like you
we have given you a splendent victory
and to guide thee on the straight path
and help you with surpassing help
it is the true guidance and the believers
and to allah only belong the armies of the heavens and the earth and allah is most honourable wise
and that he may admit the believers men and women alike into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein to dwell forever and acquit them of their evil deeds that is the mighty triumph
and that he may chastise the hypocrites men and women alike and the idolaters men and women alike and the idolaters there awaits them a mighty chastisement
and to allah only belong the armies of the heavens and the earth and allah is most honourable wise
we have sent you as witness of the truth and harbinger of good news and a warner
in order that you may gain your heart ’s order and give him the glad tidings of your hands own that the disbelievers may attain piety and evening
and those who are firm upon you
they are certain of themselves and those who are slain in allahs cause
and when they break his covenant he calls you to god with a great measure
the bedouins who were left behind will say to thee we were occupied by our possessions and our families so ask forgiveness for us
they say with their tongues what is not in their hearts
say who can avail you aught against god if he desires hurt for you or desires profit for you
nay but god is ever aware of the things you do
in fact it was you who did evil and your families and the believers were a people that did corruption
whoso does not believe in god and his messenger we have prepared for him a way out of the unbelievers
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
punish whom he will and have mercy on whom he please
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
those who had stayed behind will say when you depart for taking the spoils allow us to follow you
they wish to change the word of god
tell them you will not follow us
that is what god has already said before
they will say in fact you are envious of our gain
nay but little do they understand
and say to the bedouins who left behind you if you willingly or unwillingly it shall not have a grievous punishment
there is no fault in the blind and there is no fault in the lame and there is no fault in the sick
whosoever obeys god and his messenger he will admit him to gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever that is the recompense of the mighty triumph
god was favoured by the faithful to strengthen thy heart and to cleanse themselves and purify them and to teach them the believers
and many spoils to take
god is allpowerful and allmighty
god has promised you many spoils to take and to take you out of your hands and he has restrained peoples ’ hands from you and to guide you in the straight path
and other spoils you were not able to take god has power over everything
and if the disbelievers were to fight you they will turn away and flee and then they will not find any supporter nor any aide
this is the law of god effective as before
and thou shalt never find any changing the wo nt of god
it is he who restrained their hands from you in the heart of makkah and your hands from them after them
and god sees the things you do
do not enter you they are unable to do the holy mosque unless you are sacred mosque and the same as deserves the verses of allah – and for the holy mosque which we have appointed great mercy ”
had it not been for the believers men and women of belief would have been idolaters and whom you have been killed even though you were at rest the thoughts of belief and had god willed he would have given you authority
the unbelievers hearts and the believers have built above the believers and the hypocrites and that god may pardon and overlook their faults and god is witness between them and his messenger and the believers and built the unbelievers
god has knowledge of everything
god has truly made the truthful dream of his apostle
god has truly made the vision of his apostle come true you will surely enter the holy mosque if god please without any fear having shaved your hair cut short not fearing
he knew what you knew not and appointed ere that a nigh victory
it is he who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth
god suffices as a witness
say the name of god
so those who are with him are severe fighters among themselves are the enemies of allah and his noble messenger are the enemies of the believers and the hypocrites are priests and monks among them from allah – and they are the equals of the muslims
and you will see them bowing in reverence seeking his favour and acceptance of your enemies
their mark is on their faces the trace of prostration
and the example of the noble messenger from their faces the bright of allah and the truthful ones turned their backs in order to drink causing turmoil in their hearts and their eyes turned white because of their disbelief blinded their eyes and the blessings of the eyes and
god has promised those that believe and do righteous deeds for them awaits forgiveness and a mighty wage
o people who believe
do not forestall the judgements of god and his apostle and do not forestall the revelation before his apostle
god is the allhearing the allknowing
verily god hears all and sees everything
o people who believe
do not raise your voices higher than the voice of the voice of the prophet nor speak to him loudly the way you shout to one another lest your deeds go to waste whilst you are unaware
they who speak in the presence of allah who had failed in a low voice in the presence of allah – and indeed allah is the most gracious
there is forgiveness for them and a great reward
surely those who call unto thee from behind the apartments the most of them do not understand
if they had waited for you to come out it would have been better for them
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o people who believe
if you are guilty of a people who have no intelligence or return to their own people shall return to you
and the messenger of god is among the believers
if god had willed he would have made you harm and made it a clear proof and has made it increased for you in belief and detestable to you but good things evil is bad and charity and falsehood and would have been good
those are the guided and the right path
in the bounty of god and the angels the blessings of him and the wisdom so god knew not
if two groups of believers come to fight one another promote peace between them
if one of them turns aggressive against the other fight against the aggressive party till it returns to gods authority so god returns to everything
verily god loves the just
the believers are brothers to each other therefore make peace between your two brothers and fear allah so that you may gain mercy
the entire muslim nation is a single brotherhood without any distinction for caste creed or colour
o believers do not make others except for a people who believe
they are better than the people of the caravan and they are better than they are small
they are better than the people of the caravan and they are better than they are small
how bad is the judgement that they make
o people who believe
avoid the repugnance of idols and false and frivolous talk
o believers eschew much suspicion some suspicion is a sin
do not spy neither backbite one another would any of you like to eat the flesh of his brother dead
do you think you would not like him
you would abominate it
god is the allhearing the allknowing
and whosoever repents and does righteousness he truly turns to them surely accepts repentance in repentance
o mankind
we have created you and made you one of mankind and one another and tribes nations in the other
indeed the one who is the greatest in the lowest place the sijjeen
god is allknowing and allwise
the arabs of the desert say we believe
say do not believe rather you do not belong to god
if you do not go away god and his apostle should have made all your deeds seem good to you but if you do not find any good to god and his apostle
god is allforgiving allcompassionate
the believers are in the way of god and his apostle have been killed or struggled in the way of god
they are the truthful and sincere
say “ what you teach your religion the way of your lord ”
they impress upon you that they have submitted
tell them do not favour me with your submission
verily god knows the unknown of the heavens and the earth
and god sees the things you do
qaf
the glorious quran
rather they were shocked that a herald of warning came to them from among themselves so the disbelievers said “ this is something really strange ”
what when we are dead and become dust
that is their return
we know what the earth diminishes of them with us is a thing that retains
nay but they cried lies to the truth when it came to them and are in a confused state
have they not looked at the sky above them how we have fashioned and adorned it and it has no flaw
and we made the earth a base so twelve – the mountains as anchors in it and kept it large enough for you to find all things
as instruction and reminder to every penitent creature
and we sent down water from the sky and grow gardens with it and caused springs to grow grain for harvest
and tall palmtrees with spathes compact
and we sent down water from the sky with it revived a dead city as it was winter season
even thus will be the life after death
the people of noah arrass and thamud denied before you
the tribe of a’ad and firaun and the fellowmen of lut
the people of the woods denied the noble messengers so my promised them had denied the noble messengers and my noble messengers and my noble messengers and my people turned away was about
did we not create the first time
nay but they are in doubt playing
and indeed we created man and we know what his soul instils in him and we are nearer to him than the hearts artery
when the two angels meet together sitting one on the right and one on the left
not a word he utters but by him is an observer ready
the palsy of death will surely come
this is what you wished to avert
and the trumpet shall be blown then behold it is the allmerciful
this is the day of decision
and whoever comes with a witness instead of faith
and you are lost in play
but the driver will say this is oblivious of your eyes
and his accompanying angel said “ this is the record of your deeds available with me ”
and god cast into hell they will be told
who hinders men from doing good the transgressor the iniquitous
therefore do not worship another deity along with allah for you will be punished
cast him into severe torment
his accompanying devil said “ our lord
i did not cause him to rebel but he himself was in extreme error ”
he shall say dispute not before me
there is no changing of my word nor am i unjust to my creatures
the day when we will ask hell “ are you filled up ” and it will answer “ are there some more ”
and paradise will be brought near not far from those who took heed for themselves and feared god
this is the expiation for an eye
the face of the most gracious will be granted together to the entire creation
who feared arrahman in secret and came with a penitent heart
enter it in peace
this is the day of eternity
in it for them is all that they may desire and with god is great reward
how many generations have we destroyed before them who cried for mercy when it was too late for escape
can they not comprehend
surely in that is a reminder to him who has a heart or will not hear
we created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six spans and no weariness came upon us
therefore patiently endure with patience what they say and sing your praises much
and proclaim his purity during the night and at the ends of the prostrations
and listen thou for the day when the caller shall call from a near place
the day when the blast is sounded they will proclaim “ peace ”
this is the day of life abiding
indeed it is we who give life and give death and towards us only is the return
then all news will be blacked out for them and they will not even ask one another
this is indeed the promise of allah and the last day will surely be raised from us this is easy for you
we know very well what they do
and remind them who fears my threat
by the swift scatterers
then comes the clouds of a wide wide slaughter
and those who move on the water gently
and those that strike violently
verily the promise made to you is true
and undoubtedly justice will surely be done
we have indeed created the heavens and the earth as a carpet what we have produced you generous to the heavens
surely you speak at variance
only those who are destined to revert are reverted from it
perish the conjecturers
who are dazed in perplexity
they ask when is the day of judgement
upon the day when they shall be tried at the fire
so now taste the punishment the result of your disbelief ”
that is what you were trying to hasten
indeed the pious are amidst gardens and springs
accepting the rewards given by their lord they were indeed an excellent bondman
they slept little in the night
and every morning asked forgiveness
and the beggar and the destitute had a share in their wealth
surely in that are signs for a people who are firm in their faith
surely in that is a sign for you
and in the heaven lies your sustenance and the promise you are given
and in the heaven lies your sustenance and the promise you are given
so by oath of the lord of the heavens and the earth this is the truth
did the news of ibrahim ’s honourable guests reach you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
when they came to him and said peace he answered peace
then he turned to his people and said what do you not eat of these offerings
then he went to his home – so he brought a healthy calf
and he conceived a fear of them
they said be not afraid they gave him good tidings of a cunning boy
then came forward his wife clamouring and she smote her face and said an old woman barren
they said thus said your lord
he is indeed allknowing and allwise
he said and what is your business envoys
they said “ we have been sent towards a guilty nation ”
