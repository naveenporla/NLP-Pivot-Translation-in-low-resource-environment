we have created you male and female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another
verily with allah is the most honourable the most honourable
god is allknowing and wellinformed
the desert arabs say we have believed
say you do not believe rather say we surrender for belief has not yet entered into your hearts
if you obey god and his messenger he will not diminish you anything of your works
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
the believers are only those who believe in god and his apostle and then have not doubted
they are the truthful
say what would you teach god what your religion is in the heavens and the earth
they impress upon you that they have submitted
say count not your islam as a favour upon me
nay but allah has conferred a favour upon you that he has guided you to belief if you believe
verily allah is the allknower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth
and allah is allseer of what you do
qaf
qaf by oath of the glorious qur’an
nay they wonder that there has come to them a warner muhammad saw from among themselves and the disbelievers say this is a strange thing
when we are dead and turned to dust and bones how can we be raised again
that is a far returning
we know what the earth consumes of them for we have the book that preserves everything
in fact they denied the truth when it came to them so now the truth came to them so they are in a case confused
have they not looked at the heaven above them how we have fashioned and adorned it and there are no rifts in it
and the earth we have stretched it forth and have cast upon it firm mountains therein and have caused to grow therein of every beauteous kind of plants
an insight and a reminder for every slave turning to allah ie the one who believes in allah and performs deeds of his obedience and always begs his pardon
and we send down water from the sky and we cause the grain to grow grain so those who are almuttaqun the pious see v 22
and tall datepalms with ranged clusters
and tall datepalms with their spathes pile on pile
even so is the coming forth
the people of noah arrass and thamud denied before you
and ad and firaun pharaoh and the brethren of lout lot
and the dwellers in the wood and the people of tubba everyone of them denied their messengers so my punishment became inevitable
what were we wearied by the first creation
nay they play in doubt
we created man and we know what his soul whispers within him and we are nearer to him than his jugular vein
when the two angels who keep the account one sitting on the right and one on the left
not a word does he or she utter but there is a watcher by him ready to record it
and the stupor of death will come in truth this is what you have been avoiding
and the trumpet will be blown
this is the day of judgement
and every soul will come up with a driver and a witness
you were heedless of this therefore we have removed from you your covering and sharp is your sight this day
and his companion will say here is that with me
cast you twain into gehenna every froward unbeliever
hinderer of good transgressor doubter
who set up another god with god so both of you fling him into severe torment
his companion will say o lord i did not lead him astray in far error
he will say dispute not before me in front of me i had already not been unjust to my creatures
the sentence is not changed with me i will not be unjust to my servants
on the day when we will say to hell are you filled with denial
and paradise will be brought close for the pious
this is the paradise you will be told as a reward for whoever fears god
in the hearts of those who fears arrahman secretly and came with a heart penitent
this is a promise from the most gracious who believes in the oneness of allah and in the hereafter he will be informed of the most beneficent allah and in the last day
this is the day of abidence
for them is all that they may desire and with us is more than it
and how many a generation we destroyed before them who cried lies to them although we destroyed that it was not a township which we destroyed before them
verily herein is a reminder unto him who hath an admonition or a heart or bringeth
and indeed we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and fatigue did not even approach us
so be thou patient under what they say and proclaim thy lords praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting
and proclaim his purity during the night and after the customary prayers
and listen on the day when the caller will call from a near place
the day they actually hear the blast will be the day of rising of the dead
the day they will come out of the graves quickly as racing to one another
verily we it is who give life and cause death and unto us is the journeying
on the day when the earth will split asunder they will come out hurriedly this is easy for us
we know very well what they say is
you o muhammad saw are not accountable for them in fact you are not accountable for them in the quran by the quran by the sunnah of the message of muhammad saw are not a watcher by the kabah in makkah
by the swift scatterers
and the burdenbearers
and the ships that glide with ease
and those angels who distribute provisions rain and other blessings by allahs command
verily the promise made to you is true
and verily the requital is surely to befall
by the heaven full of paths
you are only in different opinions regarding this qur’an
turned aside therefrom is who is turned aside
they will say “ when will the state of the dazed looks of it has been taken into the midst of a dying man ”
who dissimulate
they ask when will be the day of recompense
the day they will be burnt in the fire
and why should you not eat of that which you have been working
this is what you were trying to hasten
verily the godfearing will be in a station secure
taking joy in the things which their lord has given them
they were indeed virtuous before this
they used to sleep only a little during the night
and in the dawns they prayed for forgiveness
and in their properties there was the right of the beggar and non beggar
and in the earth are signs for those who do not believe
and within yourselves
do you not see that whatever is in heaven and the earth has been promised you and its fruits are twice over you
and in the heaven is your provision and that you are promised
by the lord of the heaven and the earth it is sure even as you are a fact that you are speaking
has the story of abrahams honoured guests come to you
when they came to him and said peace he answered peace
then he turned away privately unto his household and brought a calf fatted
and he set it before them and said wherefore eat ye not
then he conceived a fear of them when they ate not they said fear not
they said fear not and they gave him glad tidings of a youth knowing
his wife came forward and ascertain about yusuf and his brother then said oh i am old and i am a son when i am old and i am a old man
they said even so says your lord is the allwise the allknowing
he said what is your errand sent ones
they said we have been sent to a people who are mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disbelievers in allah
to throw upon them stones of baked clay
marked by your lord for those who waste their substance
so we brought forth such believers as were in it
but did not find more than one house of those who have surrendered themselves
and we left therein a sign for those who fear the painful chastisement
and we made moses a sign to them
but he turned away with his court and said a sorcerer or a man possessed
so we seized him and his army and threw them into the sea while he was blaming himself
and in aad also was a lesson when we sent against them the barren wind
it left out nothing it came but made it as stuff decayed
and in thamud there is also a sign when they were told enjoy yourselves for a while
and those who followed the command of their lord – so they all were destroyed by their lord
and they were not able to stand upright and were not helped
and before them we destroyed the people of nuh noah verily they were a people sinful
and we have built the heaven with hands the divine power and it is we who are the expanse
and we have spread out the earth how excellent spreader thereof are we
and of everything we have created pairs that you may remember
and what you have performed
i am unto you a warner manifest
and set not up with allah another god
i am a plain warner to you from him
likewise no messenger came to those before them but they said a sorcerer or a man possessed
what have they willed this utterance to one another
in fact they are a rebellious people
so turn thou from them thou wilt not be reproached
and remind the reminder profits the believers
and i allah created not the jinns and humans except they should worship me alone
i do not ask any sustenance from them nor wish that they should feed me
verily allah is the allprovider owner of power the most honourable the all knowing
and verily for those who do wrong there is a portion like unto the torment which came upon them
they will be in a recognized that they will not be able to keep it
and by oath of the mount sinai
and by the book inscribed
and by the book inscribed
by the house inhabited
by the mount
and the sea swarming
verily the torment of thine lord is sure to befalls
there is none who could avert it
on the day when the heaven will shake with a dreadful shaking
and the mountains are in motion
ruin is for the deniers on that day
those who are playing in pursuits
a day when they will be pushed forcibly shoved towards the fire of hell
this is the fire which you used to belie
is this magic or do you not see
roast in it or endure it surely it is true
you are being requited only for what you had done
verily the godfearing will bein gardens and delight
enjoying in that which their lord has bestowed on them and the fact that their lord saved them from the torment of the blazing fire
eat and drink with relish as reward for what you had done
reclining on couches ranged and we shall couple them with maidens wide eyed
and those who believe and whose progeny follow them in faith we shall join their offspring in their faith with them and we shall not decrease the reward of their good deeds in the least
every soul is pledged to what it does
and we shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire
therein they shall neither die therein nor live a cup from one to another
and their boy servants came to them as if they were hidden pearls
and some of them draw near to others questioning
saying aforetime we were afraid with our families from the punishment of allah
and god has obliged us and has protected us from the torment of the scorch
we were indeed virtuous before this
he is the forgiving the merciful
therefore wait for your lords command you are neither a soothsayer nor a madman
or do they say he is a poet for whom we expect an adverse turn of fortune
say wait then i too am waiting with you
or do they want that it is a people who are mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals polytheists sinners etc
or do they say he has forged it
nay but they believe not
so let them bring a single discourse like it if they are truthful
or were they created of themselves or were they the creators
or did they create the heavens and the earth
nay but they are not believers
or are with them the treasures of your lord
or are they the registrars
or have they a ladder whereon they listen
then let any of them that has listened bring a clear authority
what have they males and he females
or is it that you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ask any fee from them so they are burdened with the penalty
or is the unseen in their keeping and so they are writing it down
or do they want to stage a deception then only a deceiving thing
but as for those who disbelieve their deeds will be lost in the life of this world and they will not be the recompense of those who do not believe
or have they a decree from god other than god
high be he exalted above that they associate with him
and if they should see a fragment of the heaven falling down they would say it is only clouds piled up
so leave them until they face their day of doom when they will be stunned
the day when their plotting will not avail them at all nor will they be helped
and verily for those who do wrong there is another punishment ie the torment in this world and in their graves before this but most of them know not
and be patient on the promise of your lord for you are never forgetful ”
and proclaim the praise of thy lord when thou arisest
and at night and at the ends of the stars
by the star when it goes down or vanishes
your companion did not err nor did he go astray
nor does he speak of his own desire
this is only a revelation revealed
he was taught by the extremely powerful
one strong of make then he hath perfected it verily he
he was on the horizon of the highest heaven
then he drew near and drew closer
till a space of two bow arcs or even less remained
so did allah convey the inspiration to his slave muhammad saw through jibrael gabriel
the heart lied not in that which he saw
what then is he who hath seen that he is in his heart so will ye not be able to see
and assuredly he saw him at another descent
and indeed he saw him another time
and allah is ever allknower of what you do
when the lotetree was covered over with what it was covered over
the sight did not shift nor did it cross the limits
indeed he saw some of the greatest signs of his lord
what thinkest thou
and manat the third the other
what have you males and he females
that indeed is a division unfair
they are only names which you have named you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority
or shall man have what he wishes
and verily allah is the last hereafter and the first
how many an angel there is in the heavens and the earth whose intercession does not benefit the least
those who do not believe in the hereafter name the angels with the names of females
they have no knowledge of it they do not have any knowledge of it
so turn away from him who turns away from our remembrance and desires only the present life
that is the knowledge of the things they could reach of knowledge
verily your lord it is he who knows best who strays from his way and he knows best who has gone astray from his way
and to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth – the recompense of what they did and the best of what they used to do
those who avoid the heinous sins and indecencies save lesser offences surely those who go astray save them
and thy lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
he knows you well when he produced you from the earth and when you were in your mothers wombs and he knows your own lives and your heart is a place of worship
he is the best knower of the things they do
what thinkest thou if he cries lies and turns away
and gave a little and then stopped giving
does he have knowledge of the unknown that he perceives everything
or do they say moses
and peace be upon ibrahim abraham and said “ peace
that no burdened person with sins shall bear the burden sins of another
and that man will not obtain anything except what he strove for
and that his effort will soon be scrutinised
then he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense
and that to your lord is your returning
and that it is he who makes whom he wills laugh and made you cry
and he who ordains death and life
and that he createth the pair the male and the female
from a drop of liquid when it is added
and that upon him is another bringing forth
and that it is he who gives wealth and riches
and that it is he who is the lord of sirius
and that it is he who gave the thamud and also after they did not understand
and that it is he who destroyed the former ad people
and the people of nuh noah before them verily they were wrongdoers
and he destroyed the overthrown cities of sodom to which prophet lout lot was sent and gave to the city of sodom in palestine and in the morning
so the worst of what they had done overtook them
so o listener which favour of your lord will you doubt
this is a warner of the warners of old
the day of resurrection draws near
none except allah
this is the command of the matters that you relate
and you laugh and weep not
and you are lost in play
so bow yourselves before god and serve him
the hour has drawn nigh and the moon has been rent in sunder and if they behold a sign they turn away from the truth
and if they see a sign they turn away and say this is continuous magic
but they denied and followed their own desires whereas they only follow their own desires
but the decision thereof is with allah and also he
and assuredly there hath come unto them tidings wherein is a deterrent
containing consummate wisdom yet warnings were of no avail
so turn away from them
on the day when the caller will call to the great day ie the day of judgement that is the day of judgement
with looks downcast they will come forth from the tombs as if they were locusts scattered abroad
hastening toward the summoner the infidels will say this is a day diffrcult
the people of noah cried lies before them they cried lies to our servant and said a man possessed
then he invoked his lord saying i have been overcome so help me
we therefore opened the gates of heaven with water flowing furiously
and we opened up the springs of the earth and the waters met for a decreed end
and we carried him on a ship made of planks and nails
and we shall not cease to discover you in the fire of hell
and we have indeed left it as a sign – is there any that will remember or receive admonition
how was then my punishment of which they had been warned
and we have indeed made the qur’an easy to memorise so is there one who would remember
ad cried lies how was then my chastisement and my warnings
verily we we sent against them a raging wind on a day of calamity continuous
plucking out men as if they were uprooted stems of datepalms
how was then my punishment of which they had been warned
and we have indeed made the qur’an easy to memorise so is there one who would remember
the thamud belied the warnings
and said should we follow a man among us
we were indeed guilty of an insolent liar
has the reminder been cast upon him alone among us
in fact he is an impudent liar
they will come to know tomorrow whichsoever is a liar insolent one
we shall send the shecamel to try them so watch them and have patience
and inform them that the water is to be shared between them and them each of them turns
but they called their comrade and he took a sword and killed her
how was then my punishment of which they had been warned
we sent them upon a single scream and they became like fine green stalks and they started it became like a delusion
and we have indeed made the qur’an easy to memorise so is there one who would remember
the people of lout lot belied the warnings
verily we we sent against them a violent storm of stones which destroyed them with a mighty torment
as a favour from us
as a favour from us thus we recompense him who gives thanks
and assuredly he had warned them of our grasp but they did not understand
we therefore blinded their eyes then taste the utmost stretching out their means among my eyes and my brother ’s sight because of my punishment is the punishment of the fire and my warnings
and early in the morning the decreed punishment came upon them
taste then my torment and my warnings
and we have indeed made the qur’an easy to memorise so is there one who would remember
and assuredly unto the household of firawn came the warning
so they denied our signs all of them – we therefore seized them with the seizure of the almighty the most honourable the all knowing
are your unbelievers better than they in the heaven
or do they say we are a congregation that shall be succoured
the hypocrites will soon be routed and turn their backs
nay but the hour is their appointed time and the hour will not be able to be turned back far more bitter
the sinners are in error and insanity
on the day when they are dragged into the fire faces foremost and told taste the feel of hell
veriiy everything we have created it by a measure
and our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye
and assuredly we have destroyed your likes so is there any one who will be warned
and everything they do is in the writs
and everything small and big is written in allauh almahfuz already beforehand ie before it befalls or is done by its doer see the quran v 5722
verily the godfearing will be in gardens and among rivers
seated in an assembly of the truth in the presence of allah the omnipotent king
the most beneficent allah
and remember thou the name of thy lord
created man
he created man
the sun and the moon are scheduled
and the plants and the trees prostrate for him
and the heaven he hath elevated it and he hath set the balance
in order that you may not transgress due balance
and observe the weight with equity and make not deficient the balance
and the earth he hath lain it out for the creatures
therein fruits and palmtrees with sheaths
grain in their bellies and in corn are with it
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
he created man of clay like unto pottery
and created the jinn of a flame of fire
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
lord of both the easts and lord of both the wests
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
he has set flowing two seas that appear to meet
between them a barrier they do not overpass
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
out of them come pearls and coral
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
his are the highsailed vessels in deep ocean like the mountains
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
all that is on the earth is passing
and the face of your lord full of majesty and honour will abide forever
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth implore him
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
we shall attend to you o you two classes jinns and men
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
if you can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth then pass them if you can pass them
from which you are turning away
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
flames of smokeless fire and black smoke without flames will be let loose on you so you will not be able to retaliate
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
when the heaven will split asunder and turn rosy like the dregs of annointing oil
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
on that day no one ’s sin shall be questioned about his sin nor jinn
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
the sinners will be recognised by their faces and their feet will be seized by their forelocks and their feet
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
this is hell which the mujrimun polytheists criminals sinners etc denied
they will go between it hell and the boiling hot water
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
but such as fears the station of his lord for them shall be two gardens
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
with spreading branches
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
in which will be two springs gushing forth water
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
in which are fruits of all kinds each of two varieties
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
reclining upon couches lined with brocade the fruits of the gardens nigh to gather
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
in them are these who wish to be removed from their gaze not in them nor of men
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
lovely as rubies beautiful as coral
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
shall the recompense of kindness be aught save kindness
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
and besides these shall be two gardens
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
in gardens of tranquility
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
in which will be two springs gushing forth water
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
in which are fruits and date palms and pomegranates
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
in them are pure spouses and in which they are a better garden
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
houris cloistered in pavilions
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
untouched by any man or jinn before them
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
reclining upon green cushions and lovely druggets
o which of your lords bounties will you and you deny
blessed be the name of your lord full of majesty and beneficience
when there happeneth event
and none denies its descending
abasing exalting
when the earth is shaken with a shock
and the mountains are crumbled crumbled
so that they become dust seattered
and you will become divided into three categories
and those on the right – how fortunate are those on the right
and those of the left hand how miserable shall the fellows on the left hand be
and the preceders are the preceders
those they will be the close ones
those are they brought nigh the throne
a multitude from the ancients
and a few from the later generations
on couches wrought of gold
reclining on them facing each other
and with flesh of fowls from that which they desire
with goblets and ewers and a cup of limpid drink
unheady uninebriating
and with fruit from that which they choose
bird meats that they relish
and there will be houris fair females with wide lovely eyes as wives for the pious
like pearls safely hidden
a reward for what they did
they will hear no blasphemies there or disavowals
except the saying “ peace peace ”
and those on the right – how fortunate are those on the right
they will be among thornless lotetrees
and serried acacias
lengthened shadows
and outpoured waters
and fruit in plenty
and fruits abounding
and raised couches
verily we have created them maidens with an honourable mention
and made them virgins
loving their husbands only equal in age
for those on the right hand
a multitude from the ancients
a multitude from the ancients
and those on the left – how wretched are those on the left
in scorching wind and boiling hot water
and the shadow of a smoking blaze
neither cool nor agreeable
they were endowed with good things
and persisted in that greater sin
and they used to say when we have become dust and bones shall we indeed be raised up again
and also our forefathers
say thou verily the ancients and those of later generations
will be gathered together on a certain day which is predetermined
then you erring ones you that cried lies
you will eat of the tree of zaqqum
and you shall fill therewith your bellies
and drink over it scalding water
lapping it up like female camels raging of thirst with disease
this will be their entertainment on the day of recompense
we created you so why do you not accept the truth
what thinkest thou if he were to grow or we have created man
do you create it or are we the creators
we have incorporated death in your constitution and we shall not be hindered
we have destroyed you in the earth so that you may understand
and assuredly ye have fully known the first production wherefore heed ye not
what thinkest thou
is it you who cultivate it or is it we who develop it
if we will we can turn it into rubble then you will lament
we are debtloaded
nay but we are deprived of the fruits
what thinkest thou of the water that you drink why we it not
is it you who cause it from the rainclouds to come down or are we the causer of it to come down
if we will we can make it bitter so why do you not give thanks
what thinkest thou if he were to deny me service
is it you who made the tree thereof to grow or are we the grower
we have made it a reminder for you and that the keen ear person may understand it
so glorify the name of your lord the great
so i swear by mawaqi setting or the mansions etc of the stars they traverse
and that is indeed a mighty oath did you but know
verily it is an utmost endeavour
in a book wellguarded with allah in the heaven ie allauh almahfuz
none can touch except the purified
a sending down from the lord of all being
is this the one that you are promised
and you make its denial your share
why then when the soul reaches up to the throat –
and you at the moment are looking on
and we are nearer to him than you but you can not see
why if you are not at our disposal
why then do you not bring back the soul if you are truthful
then there shall be for him an entertainment and a garden of delight paradise
there is peace and tranquility for him and the delights paradise
and if he be of the fellows on the right hand
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him shall be the companions of the right hand
but if he is of the deniers the astray –
then his reception is the hot boiling water
and shall enter a blazing fire and made to taste its burning
this is indeed an utmost certainty
so glorify your lord the most supreme
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth halloweth allah and he is the mighty the wise
his is the dominion of the heavens and the earth
and it is he who gives life and causes death
he is the allknower of everything
he it is who created the heavens and the earth in six days then seated himself upon the throne
he knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it what comes down from the heaven and what ascends thereto
and allah is allseer of what you do
his is the dominion of the heavens and the earth
and to allah return all matters for decision
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and he knows what is in the hearts of men
believe in god and his apostle and expend of that we have made you inherit from the land
and those of you who believe and expend theirs shall be a great hire
why do you believe in your lord whereas the messenger has come to you when you believe in your lord
it is he who sends down clear signs to his servant that he may bring you forth from darkness into light
and allah is full of kindness to you
what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of allah whereas allah is the inheritor of all that is in the heavens and in the earth
those of you who spent and fought before the conquest of mecca are not equal to those who did not even your lord
those who have a higher victory over them and higher stations for those who have fought with virtue
and allah hath promised the twain
and allah is allaware of what you do
who is he that will lend god a good loan and he will multiply it for him manifold
on the day when you see those who believe and in their light advancing ahead and to them they will say “ our lord
that is the supreme achievement
on the day when the hypocrites men and women will say to the believers wait for us let us turn to your lord and to look tell us what we may borrow your light from yourself
it will be said go back to them at the place where are you now to be raised
a wall will be raised between them and a wall with which is in which there will be a door in the inward whereof there is mercy
they will call to them did we not forbid you
but you dwelt in the dwellings of your ownselves and it was only in order that you might know what we want you to do
he has subjected you to do that which is in the matter of god
so this day no ransom shall be accepted of you nor of those who disbelieved your abode is the fire that is your companion and your destination is the fire
the fire of hell is your destination
and what a wretched place to return
is not allah the time of the believers to be raised up those who received the books who disbelieved in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and the truth confirming the books which had preceded it and the prophets and the truth and the time of the common folk
and many of them are transgressors
know that allah quickeneth earth after the death thereof
we have distinguished you so that you may understand
those who believe and spend in charity and lend an excellent loan to allah such will be doubled and a good reward
and those who believe in allah and his noble messenger and honour – it is they who are the losers
they have their guerdon and their destination
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our revelations — these are the inmates of hell
know that the life of this world is but play and a pastime and an adornment and a selfglorification among you and vying in respect of riches and children
it is he who sends down the rain of the sky and the vegetation of a goodly life and the earth is a sin and god is allforgiving allcompassionate
the life of this world is but a merchandise of vanity
race towards forgiveness from your lord and towards paradise and towards paradise with a expanse
this is the grace of allah he vouchsafeth it on whomsoever he will and allah is owner of mighty grace
there is no calamity that befalls on the earth or your own selves but is in accordance with the law of causation before we make it evident
this is the creation of allah
and allah likes not prideful boasters
those who are misers and enjoin upon people miserliness allah is not in need of their charity
and whosoever turneth away then verily allah he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
we have indeed sent our noble messengers with clear signs and with them that they should make peace with all things clear evidence and that you may be witnesses
and we sent down iron wherein is great violence and many uses for men and that allah may know the unseen
verily allah is allstrong allmighty
and indeed we sent nuh noah from among them and ibrahim abraham and israel the book and wisdom and the judgement and most of them are fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
thereafter we sent our apostles successively whenever its apostle came to him with the evidences and sent down after him the gospel and we sent him the gospel and we sent him the gospel and we gave him the gospel and we instilled compassion and mercy
so we gave him the right of the importance of his right and we made his commandments and to him and to be dutiful and kind
and we have put iron collars round the earth for a torment and a firm sign for the people who believe in the oneness of allah and in their messenger muhammad saw
so we gave those of them who believed their reward but many of them are fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
o you who believe fear allah and believe in his noble messenger and fear allah and accept faith in his noble messenger and he will give you a light and will forgive you
that he may know that the people of the scripture jews and christians may know that they have no power over anything of his bounty and that god is powerful over everything
god has heard what is about her that disputes with thee concerning her husband and makes complaint unto god
and allah hears all and knows everything
those among you who have proclaimed their wives as their mothers back
their mothers are only those who gave birth to them
they utter grievous things and indeed
and allah is pardoning forgiving
and those who make their wives unlawful azzihar and then retract what they have said “ if they have gone away from their wives have gone away from them ”
this is a promise incumbent on you so that you may be known to god and god is aware of the things you do
and whosoever findeth not a slave to free on him is the fasting for two months in succession before he who is in two months and on him who is not in two months before he touch each other
that is in order that you may believe in allah and his messenger saw and that allah has prepared for you a painful punishment
and for the disbelievers there is a painful torment
verily those who oppose allah and his apostle will be abased even as those before them were abased and of a surety
we have sent down clear signs
and for the disbelievers there is a shameful punishment
on the day when allah will resurrect them all together ie the day of resurrection and inform them of what they did
god takes account of it although they forget for god takes account of it and god is witness over everything
hast thou not seen how god knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
no three or their fourth is there but he is the fourth of them and they comprehend not anything but he is with them and he is with them wheresoever they may be
and allah is the allknower of everything
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
hast thou not seen how that they were forbidden from the messenger muhammad saw and they were forbidden from the messenger and they were forbidden from sin and transgression
and when they come to you they greet you with a greeting even god does not greet you with what they say
hell in which they will burn and what an evil destination
o you who believe when you converse secretly together in sin and disobedience to the messenger but do not talk of iniquity in the case of the battle of the battle of uhud when you fear allah unto whom you shall be gathered
the devil promises those who commit shameful acts except by satan and he can not harm them in the least except the devil indeed he is the most honourable the all knowing
and in allah let believers put their trust
o you who believe when you are told to make room in the assemblies then make room god will give you more room to spread
and when it is said rise up then rise up allah will exalt those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge in degrees
and allah is allaware of what you do
o you who believe when you want to offer charity before your private consultation and go in prayer in charity before your private consultation
that is better and purer for you
and if you find not the means then indeed allah is oftforgiving most merciful
are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation with him
then when ye can not do it not and allah relented toward you establish prayer and give the poorrate and lend unto allah his apostle an poorrate and allah is of that which ye work aware
and allah is allaware of what you do
hast thou not seen those who have taken for friends a people against whom is wrathful
they are neither of you nor of them and they swear to a lie while they know
god has prepared for them a terrible chastisement
evil indeed is that which they have been performing
they have taken their oaths as a shield and they have hindered others from the way of allah wherefore theirs shall be a torment ignominious
their wealth and their children will not avail them in the least against god
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
on the day when allah will raise them all together they will swear in front of them as they swear to him as they swear in their right hand they will swear in front of you and they will swear in front of them indeed allah knows what they
lo verily they they are the liars
the satan has overpowered them and so has caused them to forget the remembrance of allah
they are the band of the satan
lo verily it is the satans band that shall be the losers
that is because they were ever disbelieving in allah and his noble messenger so that they were ever disbelieving in them and in order that allah may destroy the noble messenger and so that allah may destroy the disbelievers may destroy the books who were ever more deserving nor
allah has decreed verily it is i who shall overcome and my messengers
verily allah is allstrong allmighty
you will not find a people who believe in god and the last day loving those who oppose god and his messenger even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kin
these he has inscribed faith in their hearts and strengthened them with ruh proofs light and guidance from himself
and he will admit them to gardens with streams of running water where they will for ever abide
god is wellpleased with them and they with him
lo verily it is the allahs band that shall be the blissful
and to allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth and he only is the most honourable the wise
it is he who expelled the disbelievers from their homes from their homes at the first time and to destroy their own people and to destroy them and they would not go back on their own selves
and had allah not decreed exile for them he would have punished them in this world and in the hereafter
that is because they opposed allah and his messenger muhammad saw
and whosoever puts his trust in god he will suffice him
whatever fine palms you cut down or left standing on roots there of it allah did not disgrace the heart of the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc
and whatever spoils of war god has sent against you and his messenger from them you pricked neither horse nor camel but god gives authority to his messengers over whomsoever he will god is powerful over everything
whatever spoils of war god has given to his messenger from the people of the cities belongs to god and his messenger and the bounty and god gives authority to his messenger and his messenger
and whatsoever the apostle giveth you take and whatsoever he forbiddeth you refrain from
verily allah is severe in punishment
this is because they were a people who were with whom allah has given their covenant and allah does not like the prophets and allah is ever rich free of all wants from them
and those who have emigrated and struggled with them in their possessions and their selves and their selves in their selves they do not love them in the least
and whosoever is saved from his own covetousness such are they who will be the successful
and those who came after them say our lord forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed and had already gone astray from our lord
hast thou not regarded those who disbelieve in their friends a hypocrites who disbelieve in their friends with their jews and their enmity and if they are expelled we shall not go forth with you and we will not go forth in any way
and allah beareth witness that surely they are liars
surely if they are driven forth they will not go forth with them and if they are attacked they will not aid them
if you help them they will not be helped
and allah is more aware of what they hide from him
that is because they are a people who comprehend not the majesty and power of allah
they will not fight you except in fortified townships or from behind walls
their violence among themselves is strong against them
you think they are united but their hearts are divided
that is because they are a people who understand not
like those who were before them who tasted the mischief of their action there awaits them a painful chastisement
they are like those who were hidden in their faith and indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
and when man disbelieves in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc then remember that which he has sent forth from you o muhammad saw
i fear god the lord of all being
both of them will end up in the fire wherein they will abide for ever
that is the recompense of the evildoers
o you who believe fear allah and keep your duty to him
let every soul consider what it has forwarded for the morrow and fear god
god is aware of what you do
and be not like those who forgot allah so he caused them to forget their own souls
they are the fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
not equal are the dwellers of the fire and the dwellers of the paradise
the dwellers of paradise will be the dwellers of paradise they will abide in it forever
and had we sent this quran down on a mountain you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of allah
and indeed we have illustrated all kinds of examples in this qur’an for mankind – so most men did not accept except in order to be ungrateful
he is god there is no god but he the knower of the unknown and the known and the known
he is the benevolent evermerciful
all the praises and thanks be to allah there is no god but he the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
he is allah the creator the maker the fashioner his are the excellent names
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth halloweth allah
and he is the allmighty the allwise
o believers take not my enemy and your enemy and your enemy as friends showing affection towards me
if you have come out to struggle in my cause having sought my acceptance do not be friendly with them in secret
but when it was said to them “ take them as auliya protectors and helpers but when you have believed in the message you say and i know what you disclose and i know what you hide ”
and whosoever of you doth that then he hath gone astray from the right way
if they gain dominance over you they will be your enemies and will extend their hands and their tongues towards you with evil and they wish that you should disbelieve in the least harm
neither your bloodkindred nor your children shall profit you upon the day of resurrection he shall distinguish between you
and allah is allseer of what you do
and in abraham and those who argued with you about our people and those who were arrogant and those who believed with him say “ what you have been given by god and his people in this i will not renounce you and i will surely worship you and
our lord make us not an example of infidels and forgive us and have mercy on us thou art the allmighty the allwise
assuredly there hath been in them an excellent patternfor him who hopeth for allah and the last day
and whosoever turneth away then verily allah he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
belike allah may make an enemy between you and those of them whom ye hold as enemies affection
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
god does not forbid you from those who did not deal with those who did not fight against you in religions cause nor expelled you from your habitations that you should be kindly to them
verily allah loves those who are equitable
god only forbids you as regards those who fought against you in religions cause and expelled you from your habitations and supported in your expulsion that you should take them for friends
and whosoever takes them for friends those they are the evildoers
o believers when believing women come to you as emigrants test them
god is aware of their faith
and if you find them back to the disbelievers punish them for the disbelievers is never manifest sin
and give them what they have expended
there is no sin on you if you marry them as disbelievers
and give them what they have expended and there is no fault in them that they may be the wedded believing women
that is the argument between you and you he will judge between you
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and if any of your wives slips away from you to the unbelievers and then you retaliate give them what they have expended
and fear allah in whom you believe
o prophet when believing men and believing women come to you from where they will not associate anything with god nor steal nor fornicate nor kill their children nor accuse their children nor will they kill their children nor commit illegal sexual intercourse
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe take not for friends with them a people who have incurred the wrath of allah ie the jews
they have despaired of the hereafter even as they have despaired the entombed of the infidels s
and to allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth and he only is the most honourable the wise
o you who believe why do you not believe
most hateful is with allah that you say that which you do not do
verily allah loveth those who fight in his way drown up in ranks as though they were a structure well compacted
and recall what time musa said unto his people o my people wherefore hurt ye me when surely ye know that verily i am unto you an apostle from allah
so when they turned away from the path of allah allah turned their hearts away from their dwellings
and allah guides not the people who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
and recall what time isa son of maryam said unto the children of israil verily i am unto you an apostle confessing to that which was before me and unto you is an apostle and a warner manifest
but when he brought them the clear proof of this is come to them
who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies about god and denies the truth when it has come to him
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
they want to extinguish the light of god by uttering blasphemies but god will not have it so pleasing to the unbelievers
it is he who has sent his noble messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to prevail over all other religions – even though the idolaters dislike it
o you who believe shall i direct you to a commerce that will deliver you from a painful torment
strive in the cause of allah and with your wealth and soul that will be given wealth and soul
that is better for you if you only knew
he will forgive you your sins and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow – in paradise – and to dwell in it forever
that is the supreme achievement
and he will give you what you love from allah and a victory near victory
“ o eisa the son of maryam – when allah will help me in the way eisa the son of maryam – when i am going to help you in the cause of allah ” they said “ who will be my supporters towards allah ”
and a party of the children of israel believed and a party disbelieved
so we confirmed those who believed against their enemy and they became masters
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god the king the allholy the allmighty the allwise
it is he who sent among the unlettered ones a noble messenger from among themselves who recites to them his verses and purifies them and teaches them the book and wisdom and the wisdom and the wisdom and the wisdom and the torah and the injeel gospel them in
and he has not yet joined them but he is the allmighty the allwise
this is the grace of allah he vouchsafeth it on whomsoever he will and allah is owner of mighty grace
the likeness of those who were laden with the taurat and then they bare it not is as the likeness of the ass bearing tomes
god does not show the unrighteous the way he shows the signs of a painful example
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
but they will never long for it death because of what their hands have sent ahead and they will not wish
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
say surely the death from which you flee will surely meet you
and you will be brought back to him who knows the unseen and the visible and the end will be brought back to him who knows what you did
o you who believe when the call for prayer is made on friday the day of congregation rush towards the remembrance of allah and stop buying and selling this is the promise that must be taken by allah and call for allah and be rescued by making your invocations
that is better for you if you only knew
and when the prayer is finished scatter in the land and seek gods bounty and remember god frequently haply you will prosper
and when they see some merchandise or some amusement beating of tambur drum etc they disperse headlong to it while delivering jumuahs religious talk khutbah and they lay dead standing while delivering jumuahs religious talk khutbah and it is just making it as if allah wills he is better
when the hypocrites come to you they say we bear witness that you are indeed liars
god knows that you are indeed his messenger and god bears witness that the hypocrites are liars
they have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of god
verily vile is that which they have been working
so their hearts were sealed – so they do not understand
and when you look at them their bodies please you and when they speak you listen to their words
they are those who are counted weak and fought among themselves and their families is like unto each other in bands of religious learned men
they are the enemy so beware of them
how they are perverted
and when it is said to them come now to the noble messenger of allah and to them “ come now – and ask forgiveness for you they turn heads
equal it is for them whether thou askest forgiveness for them or askest not forgiveness for them allah will forgive them not
verily allah guides not the people who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
they are the ones who say spend not on those who are with allahs messenger until they desert him
and to allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites comprehend not
they will say if you return to the city surely we shall be the greatest if we return to the inhabitants of the city
but honour is only for allah and his noble messenger and the hypocrites do not know that allah only is the great the hearts of the believers
o you who believe let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of allah
and whosoever does that then they are the losers
spend of that with which we have provided you before death comes to one of you and he says o my lord i had given you a little while then i would have given you a better deal
and allah grants respite to none when his appointed time death comes
and allah is allaware of what you do
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
his is the dominion and his is the praise and he is over everything potent
it is he who created you in the wombs one of you is an unbeliever
and allah is allseer of what you do
he created the heavens and the earth with deliberation and gave you form and shaped you well and to him is your returning
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and he knows what you hide and what you disclose
and allah is the allknower of what is in the breasts of men
did not the news of those who disbelieved before you reach you
so they tasted the evil result of its disbelief and theirs will be a painful torment
that was because their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they said should allah guide us to the truth and they said what shall we turn away from the way
god is the sublime the merciful
the unbelievers assert that they will never be raised up
say yes by my lord you will be resurrected then you will be informed of what you did
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
therefore believe in allah and his noble messenger and in the light which we have sent down
and allah is allaware of what you do
and remember the day he will gather you together on the day of gathering that will be the day of gathering that will be the day of mutual loss
and whosoever believeth in allah and his apostle and worketh righteously him he will cause to enter gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders therein for evermore
that is the supreme achievement
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations will be inmates of hell where they will abide for ever
no calamity befalls unless god dispenses
it is not for any person to return to it and he is able to do all things
and allah is the allknower of everything
and obey allah and obey the noble messenger and the noble messenger is only responsible for your duty placed on the earth but the duty placed on our noble messenger is only to plainly convey the message
allah there is no god but he
and in allah let believers put their trust
o you who believe if a band and a part of them is surely your enemies so fear god and do not disgrace them and be forgiving and kind
your wealth and your children are only a trial whereas allah is a great reward
so fear allah as much as you can and listen and obey and spend in allahs cause as much as you can in the end
and whosoever is saved from his own covetousness such are they who will be the successful
if you lend an excellent loan to allah he will multiply it for you and will forgive you
and allah is rich free of all wants and he is mostforbearing
the all knowing of every hidden and the visible the most honourable the wise
when you divorce women divorce them at their iddah prescribed periods and count accurately their iddah periods
and fear allah your lord and do not leave them in their houses nor should they go out
these are the limits ordained by allah
and whosoever transgresses the limits ordained by allah then he maketh himself a part of the wrongdoers
you can not know that god may perchance lead you back to life again
then when they have attained their period then when they have attained their period then keep them honourably
and call in witness two just persons from among you muslims
and he forgave him
and whosoever feareth allah he maketh for him an outlet
and he provideth for him from whence he reckoneth not upon
and whosoever puts his trust in allah then he will suffice him
god attains his purpose
god has appointed a measure for everything
and as for your women who have gone forth from their wives then as they have despaired of menstruation if you have a prescribed period of waiting for them then they have not attained its age
and as for those who are pregnant their prescribed period is until they deliver their burthen
and whosoever feareth allah he maketh his affair unto him easy
that is the commandment of allah which he hath sent down unto you and whosoever feareth allah he will expiate his misdeeds from you and will give him an hire
lodge them wheresoever ye lodge yourselves according to your means and hurt them not so as to straiten them
and if they are pregnant then spend on them till they deliver their burden
but if you make difficulties another woman shall suckle for him
let the man of means expend according to his means and whosoever is stinted in his subsistence let him expend of that which allah hath given him
allah burdens not a person beyond what he has given him
god will bring forth after hardship
how many a city that rebelled against their lords command and his messengers and we took retribution from it
so they tasted the evil result of its disbelief and the consequence of its disbelief was loss destruction in this life and an eternal punishment in the hereafter
god has prepared for them a terrible chastisement and fear god o men of pure believing
god has sent down to you a reminder
an apostle who recites before you the explicating revelations of god that he may bring those who believe and do the right out of darkness into light
and whosoever believeth in allah and worketh righteously him he will cause to enter gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders for evermore
god has indeed granted for him an excellent provision
allah it is who hath created seven heavens and of them seven heavens and of them
he knows what you argued and he will realise tomorrow and god surrounds him he is of everything
o prophet why should you forbid what god has made lawful for you that you should forget what is lawful for them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
god has ordained expiation for your oaths
god is your master and he is the allwise the allknowing
and when the prophet confided a story but when she heard of his wives of she said “ it does not befit allah ’s majesty to him and he knows what he does not know who has sent down this incident of that which he has heard of the
then when he had apprised her of it she said who hath acquainted me therewith he said the knower of the aware
if you both turn to your hearts again turn to god and his messenger yet if you repent you will be your hearts again and if you believe and fear him god is the protector of the believers and the emigrants nevertheless you should forgive you him and the
if he divorces you his lord will give you better than you in case he divorces you his lord will give him a righteous believer in the oneness of allah
o you who believe be your full submission and the angels stern towards you and merciful you have a thousand of the angels stern towards you and the disbelievers are stern against the disbelievers
and it will be said “ make no excuses today you will not be repaid for any recompense for what you used to do ”
do not feign excuses this day you will only be repaid what you used to do ”
o you who believe turn to god and turn to him in repentance
belike your lord will expiate from you your misdeeds and let him forgive you your misdeeds and let him make you enter gardens whereunder rivers flow and those who believe with him allah will surely humiliate them in places of success
and their lord will come to them and their light will say “ our lord
perfect our light and forgive us verily you are able to do all things
o prophet strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them and the hypocrites and be severe to them
god advances the example of noahs wife and the wife of lot for those who do not believe
they were under two of our righteous slaves but they were unfaithful to them and even of them but they worshipped them with the apostles of god and even more and it was said to them enter with those who enter the houses of god
and allah propoundeth for those who believe the wife of firawn when she said my lord build me in paradise in thy house in thine presence a goodly house and deliver me from the people of firawn and the wrongdoers
and the similitude of maryram daughter of lmran who preserved her chastity wherefore we breathed in it of our spirit and she believed in it of our spirit and she was of the obedient
blessed be he in whose hand is the dominion and he is powerful over everything
who created death and life that he might try you which of you is fairest in works and he is the allmighty the allforgiving
who created the seven skies one above another
can you see any disproportion in the creations of arrahman
turn thy gaze seest thou any fissure
then return thy gaze again and again and again
your gaze turns back dazed and tired
and indeed we have beautified the lower heaven with lamps and have made them weapons against the devils and have kept prepared for them the punishment of the blazing fire
and for those who disbelieve in their lord is the torment of hell and what a wretched destination
when they are cast therein they will hear its raging fire
as though it would burst with fury
and whenever a group is thrown into it its wardens will ask did not a warner come to you
they will say yes indeed a warner came to us but we denied him and said god has sent down no knowledge
you are only in palpable error
and they will say had we but listened or used our intelligence we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing fire
so they confess their guilt
surely those who fear their lord unseen ie they do not see him and they will have forgiveness and a great reward
whether you discuss secretly or openly he knows what lies within the hearts
shall he not know who created
it is he who made the earth subservient to you so go forth in it and eat of things he has provided you
or are you confident that he will not cause the heaven to sink you in the earth with you or cause it to fall upon it
or are ye secure that he who is in heaven will not send against you a violent whirlwind
then you will know how terrible was my punishment
and indeed those before them belied and so how did my rejection turn out
have they not seen the birds above them spreading their wings and folding them in
nothing holds them aloft but god
he is the allseer of everything
and there will be no help you in the most beneficent allah
the unbelievers are only in delusion
who is he that can provide for you if he should withhold his provision
in fact they persist in rebellion and hatred
what is he who walks prone on his face better guided than he who walks upright on a straight path
say it is he who has created you and endowed you with hearing ears seeing eyes and hearts little thanks you show
say it is he who has created you in the earth and to him you will be gathered in the hereafter
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
and say thou verily i am a plain warner
and when they see it they will be gathered together on the faces of the disbelievers will be vexed but when they will be taken in the fire they will be asked what you used to deny
say what think you if god destroys me and those with me or he will chastise us with a painful chastisement
say he is god in the allmighty the allknowing
you will come to know who is in manifest error
say what think you if in the morning your water were to dry who will bring you running water from the earth
nun
by the pen and what they inscribe
you o muhammad saw are not by the grace of your lord a madman
and verily thine shall be an unending reward
and verily thou art of a high and noble disposition
and you will see and they will see
and thou shalt see and they will see
verily your lord it is he who knows best who strays from his way and he knows best who has gone astray from his way
so do not comply with those who deny
they wish that you should compromise in religion out of courtesy with them so they too would compromise with you
and do not listen to any excessive oath maker ignoble person
who hinders men from doing good the transgressor the iniquitous
hinderer of the good transgressor sinful
crude and above all mean and infamous
what is the matter with you in wealth and children
when our verses of the quran are recited to him he says tales of the ancients
we shall brand him on the muzzle
we have tried them as they tried the owners of the garden when they swore that pluck in the morning
and no burdened person with sins shall be carry burden sins of another
so the torment overtook them while they were sleeping
so in the morning it became as if harvested
then they called out one to another as soon as the morning broke
saying go out betimes to your tilth if ye would reap
so they departed conversing in secret low tones saying
no needy person enters it shall enter paradise today
and they went in the morning with strong intention thinking that they have power to prevent the poor taking anything of the fruits therefrom
but when they saw it they said we have indeed gone astray
nay but we have been robbed
the most moderate of them said said said said did i not tell you why do you not proclaim his purity
they said glory be to him
we have been evildoers
then they turned one against another in blaming
they said woe alas for us truly we were insolent
belike our lord may exchange a better garden than this
verily we are turning to our lord
such is the torment
and surely the torment of the hereafter is greater if they but know
for the godfearing are gardens of bliss with god
shall we equate the muslims to the guilty
what ails you then how you judge
what ails you then how you judge
or have you a book through which you learn
that therein is yours that which ye may choose
or have you oaths from us reaching to the day of resurrection that you shall have whatever you judge
ask them who has created this
or have they partners
on the day when the shin will be exposed and they will be called to prostrate themselves they will be unable used as a metaphor
eyes lowered shame attending
they had indeed been called to prostrate themselves while they were whole
so leave him who cries lies to this discourse
we shall lead them step by step to ruin in a way they will not know
and i will give them respite
verily my plan is strong
or do you demand any wages from them so that they are burdened with expense
or is the unseen in their keeping and so they are writing it down
so wait with patience for the decision of your lord and do not be like onah of the fish who called to his lord when he was choked with anger
but for his grace he would have been left in a state of humiliation and misery
but his lord chose him and made him of the righteous
and when those who disbelieve almost stab you with their glances when they hear the reminder and they say “ he is crazy ”
and it is naught but an admonition unto the worlds
the inevitable calamity
what is the startling calamity
and what shall make thee know that which the crushing fire is
the thamud and ad denied the consequential calamity
as for thamud they were destroyed by a storm of thunder and lightning
as for ad they were destroyed by a furious violent wind
he determined it he who is wheresoever you may lead them out of heaven for seven nights and eight days uninterruptedly and he laid it upon them as if they were in it fallen down in it fallen down
beholdest thou any of them remaining
and firaun pharaoh and those before him and those before him and the towns of the population of lout lot committed sin
surely those who are overwhelmed due to the wrath of their lord
verily we when the water rose we bare you upon the traversing ark
that we might make it a reminder for you and that the ears that store may remember
when the trumpet blast is sounded a second blowing
and the earth and the mountains shall be removed from their places and crushed with a single crushing
then on that day the great event will come to pass
and the heaven will split asunder – so on that day it will be unstable
and the angels will stand upon its sides and on that day eight angels will carry above them their throne of your lord
on that day you will be exposed not one secret of yours will be the first to be called to you
then as to him who shall be given his book in his right hand he shall say here read my book
and i was a witness over my message
so he shall be in a pleasing life
in a lofty garden –
the fruit clusters of which are hanging down
eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you were working
but as for him who is given his book in his left hand he shall say oh would that i had not been given my book
and not known my account
“ alas if only it had been just death ”
my wealth has not availed me
vanished has my power from me
seize him and drag him into the depths of hell it will be said
then throw him in the blazing fire
then fasten him with a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits
verily he was wo nt not to believe in allah the mighty
nor he urged on others the feeding of almiskin the poor
so he today has not here one loyal friend
nor any food save filthy corruption
none will eat it but the khatiun sinners disbelievers polytheists etc
so i swear by the afterglow of sunset
and by that you do not see
that this is indeed the word of an honoured messenger
and it is not the speech of a poet little is that you believe
nor is it the word of a soothsayer or a foreteller little is that you remember
a sending down from the lord of all being
if he had forged a lie against us
we would have definitely taken revenge from him
then cut off his aorta
and not one of you could have defended him
and verily this quran is an admonition unto the godfearing
and indeed we know that some among you are deniers
and verily it is an absolute truth with certainty
and verily this this quran is an absolute truth with certainty
so glorify the name of your lord the great
a questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall
for the unbelievers there is severe punishment
from god the lord of the steps of progression
the angels and the ruh jibrael gabriel ascend to him in a day which is a day which is sent down
so be patient o muhammad saw with a good patience
they deem it to be remote
but we see it quite near
the day the sky will be like molten brass
and the mountains shall be like plucked wooltufts
and no friend inquires after friend
and his wife and his brother should not be the survivors
and his wife and his brother
and his kin that sheltered him
and all those who are on the earth so that it might deliver him
no
it is pure white flame
in a sure abode is certain
calling him who drew back and turned away
who amasses and then hoards
verily man is formed impatient
irritable discontented when evil touches him
and when good toucheth him he is begrudging
and those who strictly guard their five compulsory congregational salawat prayers at their fixed stated hours
those who are regular in their prayers
and in their properties there was the right of the beggar and non beggar
for the beggar and the outcast
those who believe in the day of judgement to be true
and those who fear the punishment of their lord
verily the torment of their lord is that before which none can feel secure
and those who protect their private organs from adultery
except with their wives and the bondwomen in their possession for there is no reproach on them
but those who covet more than this will be transgressors
and those who protect their trusts and their covenant
and those who stand firm in their testimonies
and those who protect their prayers
those shall dwell in gardens honoured
what aileth those who disbelieve toward thee hastening
sitting in groups on the right and on the left of you o muhammad saw
does every one of them wish to enter the garden of tranquility
never so we have created them from what they know
so i swear by the lord of the easts and the wests that we are certainly able
to replace them by others better than them and we are not to be outrun
so leave them alone to plunge and play until they encounter that day of theirs which they are promised
the day they will come out of the graves in haste as if rushing towards their goals
eyes lowered shame attending
that is the day of judgement which they will be promised
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people saying ‘ warn your people before the painful punishment comes upon them ”
he said o my people i am unto you a clear warner
that you should worship allah alone and be dutiful to him and obey me
he will forgive you your sins and will defer you to a stated term
verily allah is sure to attain it when it is not for you to return again if you but knew
he said my lord verily i have called my people night and day
but the more i called they only ran the farther away from me
and whenever i called them that thou mightest forgive them they put their fingers in their ears and wrapped them in their garments and persisted and waxed very proud
then verily i called them openly
then verily i called them openly aloud
i said i said ask forgiveness of your lord verily he is oftforgiving
he is indeed forgiving and kind
i said i said ask forgiveness from your lord he will send down rain on you he will surely turn to you in penitence
and will add to you riches and children and will appoint unto you gardens and will appoint unto you rivers
what is the matter with you that you do not go for god
‘ whereas he has created you by stages ’
have you not seen how god has created the seven heavens one above another
and has set the moon therein for a light and has set the sun a lamp
and allah hath caused you to grow from the earth as a growth
he will then return you into it and bring you forth again on the day of resurrection
and allah has made the earth a bed for you and has made the earth a spreading
that you may walk therein in broad roads
he said my lord they have not strength and whose wealth and children whose children are not arrogant unblest
and they have plotted a mighty plot
they said do not abandon your gods and do not abandon wadda or suwa or yaghuth yauq or nasr
and indeed they have misled many
and increase thou these wrongdoers in naught save error
because of their sins they were drowned and then they were drowned and then they were made to enter into the fire so they did not find any supporter for themselves against allah
and nuh said my lord leave not one of the disbelievers in the land
surely if you leave them they will mislead your slaves and will beget none but wicked disbelievers
my lord forgive me and my parents and his kin who entereth my house as a believer and believing men and believing women and destroy us in the state of disbelief
and increase thou these wrongdoers in naught save error
say it was revealed to me that a group of jinn listened to said we have heard a wonderful talk of his own kind listened or a valley
and he guides who it is to a straight path
we have believed in the oneness of allah and in his messengers we have believed in it and we will never associate any partner in worship with our lord
and that our lord has taken a son for himself he has taken a son
and the foolish among us say preposterous things of god
and we had thought that men and jinn would never speak against god a lie
and verily there were some men among mankind who would seek refuge with some jinns but it is a party of mankind that they would seek refuge with some of mankind
and they thought even as you thought that god would never raise up anyone
and we sought to reach the heaven but we found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires
we sat in observatories to listen but any one who listened found a shooting star in wait for him
and we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their lord intends for them rectitude
and of us some are righteous and some are otherwise surely we are sects differing
and we think that we can not frustrate god in the earth nor can we frustrate him by flight
verily we have sent down the book with the truth confirming that which went forth before it and a guidance and a light manifest
and whosoever believeth in his lord he shall fear neither diminution nor wrong
and of us some are muslims who submit to allah in islam
those they are the rightminded
and as for the qasitun disbelievers who deviated from the right path they shall be firewood for hell
if they nonmuslims had believed in allah and went on the right way ie islam we would have given them water rain in islam and may have made the water rain in abundance
that we might try them thereby
and whosoever turneth aside from the remembrance of his lord he shall thrust him into a torment vehement
and the mosques are for allah alone so invoke not anyone along with allah
when god servant he prays to his servant that he sees
say i call on my lord and i do not associate any one with him
say o muhammad saw i possess no power over you either for harm or to benefit or hurt or hurt etc
say thou allah shall protect me from allah nor shall i find beside him any refuge
i only convey to you the message clearly and the message clearly is only for god and the faithful
and in allah his messenger muhammad saw will be the fire of hell to abide therein forever
till when they see what they were promised then they will know who is weaker in protectors fewer in aid and poorer in numbers
say o muhammad saw yes indeed my lord has given you something in promise
he is the knower of the unseen and he discloseth not his unseen unto anyone
except for he who takes care of him and follows the noble messenger except the noble messenger
that he may know that they have preached the messages of their lord allah has kept count of them and he encompasses all things
o thou enwrapped in thy robes
stand up for worship during the night except a little
a half of it or diminish a little
or increase a little and recite the quran aloud then in a slow pleasant tone and style
we shall soon entrust to you a message heavy with solemnity
verily the rising by night and the certainty that would be better for them
verily there is for you by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties
and remember the name of your lord and leaving others devote yourself solely to him
lord of the east and the west there is no god but he
and bear thou patiently what they say and forsake them graciously
leave me with those who cry lies to thee and respite them for a little while
and with us are heavy fetters and scorch
and a food that chokes and a painful torment
on a day whereon the earth and the mountains shall quake and the mountains shall become a sandheap poured forth
we have sent a messenger to you as a witness over you and we sent a messenger to pharaoh
so firaun pharaoh disobeyed the noble messenger so we seized him with a severe seizure
how then if ye disbelieve shall ye escape on a day that shall make the children greyheaded
the heavens itself will be rent asunder on that day the earth split asunder
verily this is an admonition let him therefore who will choose a way unto his lord
your lord knows that you are occupied by night with you devotions for nearly twothirds of the night or half the night or onethird of it as do many others with you
and if they are with thee then a party of them are in the midst thereof
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to go in the night and he makes things clear to you
he knows that some of you will be sick and some others journeying in the land seeking bounty of god and others fighting in the land
then perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and lend a goodly loan to allah a goodly loan
and what you send ahead of good you will find it with allah better and greater in reward
and ask god for his forgiveness
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you wrapped in garments ie prophet muhammad saw
arise and warn
and magnify your lord
and keep your clothes clean
and stay away from idols
and do not favour others in order to be favoured with more
and those who persevere seeking the countenance of their lord and establish prayer and expend of that wherewith we have provided them
when the trump is sounded
that day will be a harsh day
for the unbelievers not easy
leave me with him whom i created alone
and gave him abundant wealth
and sons standing before him
and he has made it small and big with the same way
and who yet coveteth that shall increase
nay
verily he is refractory of our signs
i shall oblige him to climb a slippery mountain in the hellfire called assaud or to face a severe torment
verily he thought and plotted
may he be accursed how he planned
again death seize him how he determined
then he looked around
then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way
then he turned away and was haughty
and said this is nothing but magic from of old
and call not upon another god with god
then we made him to be burnt in the fire and made him a blazing pit
and what shall make thee know that which she is
it spares not neither leaves alone
scorching the skin
over it are nineteen guards
we have not sent down any one of them but angels with the books
and we have made them a book a book which we have not sent down any book but it is a confirmation of that which went before it and a detailed explanation of it is the truth confirming what is with them and it is the truth confirming what
and none can know the hosts of your lord except him
and none knoweth the hosts of thy lord but he
and this hell is nothing but an admonition unto the worlds
no
by the moon
and by the night when it departs
and by the dawn when it brightens
verily it is one of the greatest woes
a warning unto humankind
and let there be a body among you that calls unto justice and kindness and may be that which is reputable and prohibit that which is disreputable and vie with one another
every soul is pledged to what it does
except the chosen ones among your creatures
sitting in the gardens asking
the sinners will not be reprieved
what led you into the scorching fire
they will say we were not of those who used to offer their salat prayers
and we have not been feeding the poor
and we have been wading with the waders
and we have been belying the day of requital
until there came to us the death that is certain
so the intercession of the intercessors will not benefit them
what is the matter with them that they turn away from the reminder whereas they are from the reminder
even as we sent down on the dividers
fleeing from a hunter or a lion or a beast of prey
nay every man of them desires to be given scrolls unrolled
nay but they fear not the hereafter from allahs punishment
nay verily this quran is an admonition
so whoever wills may remember it
and they will not remember except as allah wills
and we have put iron collars round the earth for a torment and a firm sign for the people who believe not
i swear by the day of resurrection
and i swear by the selfreproaching soul
does man assume that we shall never assemble his bones
yes indeed we are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers
nay but man desires to continue on as a libertine
he asks when will the day of resurrection be
so when the sight is dazed
and the moon shall be ecliped
and the sun and the moon shall be joined
on that day man will say where is the refuge to flee
no there is no refuge
on that day the station is only towards your lord
on that day man will be informed of what he sent forward of his evil or good deeds and what he left behind of good or evil
nay man shall be a witness against himself as his body parts skin hands legs etc shall speak about his deeds
even though he offer his excuses
move not thy tongue therewith that thou mayest hasten therewith
ours it is to gather it and to recite it
and when we have recited it to you o muhammad saw through jibrael gabriel then follow what is revealed to its the qurans recital
then indeed to explain its details to you is upon us
no
you love the fleeting one – you do not have sense ”
and leave the hereafter
many faces will be joyous on that day
looking toward their lord
and faces on that day shall be scowling
thinking that some calamity was about to fall on them
nay when the soul reaches to the collar bone ie up to the throat in its exit
and it is said who is there any one – any magician ”
and he is the witness
and leg will be joined with another leg shrouded
unto thy lord that day is the drive
for he confirmed it not and did not pray
but he belied and turned away
then he went back to his home in pride
again woe to you o man disbeliever and then again woe to you
again woe to you o man disbeliever and then again woe to you
does man assume that he will be let loose
was he not a spermdrop spilled
then he became a clot then he created him and formed him
and he created from him two kinds male and female
is not that one then able to quicken the dead
has there not come upon man a space of time when he was not at all
we created man of a spermdrop a mingling and we made him hearing seeing
we surely showed him the way whether he be grateful or ungrateful
we have prepared for the unbelievers chains fetters and a blaze
verily the abrar pious who fear allah and avoid evil shall drink a cup of wine mixed with water from a spring in paradise called kafur
it is allah who created the water of his slaves that will drink causing it to gush forth plenteously from all things that it is he who gives it as a little
they fulfill their vows and dread a day whose evil is widespread
and feed the needy for the love of him and the orphans and the captives
saying we feed you seeking allahs countenance only
no reward do we ask of you for it
we fear a day whereon they will turn the faces and say our lord verily we fear that there will befall thee a day of distress
so god saved them from the evil of that day and gave them freshness and joy
and reward them for their perseverence paradise and silken robes
reclining therein on raised thrones they will see there neither the excessive heat of hell nor the excessive heat of hell
and its shade will cover them and its fruit clusters brought down low for them
and amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and also goblets of glass
crystalclear made of silver they will determine the measure thereof according to their wishes
and therein they shall be given to drink a cup whereof the admixture will be ginger
a spring there called salsabil
and with flesh of fowls from that which they desire
and you see them awake although they were asleep
and when you look around you see delights and great dominion
on their bodies will be garments of the finest green silk and brocade and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver and their lord will give them a purest draught to drink boiling water
this is your recompense and your endeavour has been accepted
verily we we have sent down to you o muhammad saw the quran a scripture ie the quran in which is inspired in you gradually
so wait with patience or do not follow their desires and be ungrateful
and remember thou the name of thy lord in the morning and in the evening
and during the night long save a little
verily these men love the hasty world and leave be behind them a heavy day
it is we who created them and we have made them of strong built
this is a reminder so whosoever wills let him take a way to his lord
but you can not will unless god wills
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
he admits into his mercy whomever he wills and for the unjust he has prepared a painful punishment
by the winds or angels or the messengers of allah sent forth one after another
by the swift scatterers
by the spreading winds spreading
and by the angels that bring the revelations from allah
and those that bring down the reminder
to end all argument or to warn
verily the promise made to you is true
when the stars shall be thrown down
when the heaven is split asunder
and when the mountains are blown away
and when the messengers are gathered to their time appointed
for what day is that time fixed
the day of judgement
and what shall make thee know that which the day of requital is
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not destroy the ancients
then we destroyed them with utter destruction
thus do we deal with the mujrimun polytheists disbelievers sinners criminals etc
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not create you from a worthless water semen etc
we then kept it in a safe place
till a known term decreed
we are the rangers
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not make the earth a storehouse
for the living and the dead
and we have made therein firm and tall mountains and have given you to drink sweet water
ruin is for the deniers on that day
depart unto that which ye were wo nt to belie
depart to a triplemassing shadow
unshading against the blazing flame
verily it shall cast forth sparks like unto a castle
as if they were jimalatun sufr yellow camels or bundles of ropes
ruin is for the deniers on that day
this is a day when they will not be able to speak
and they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse
ruin is for the deniers on that day
this is the day of decision we have gathered you and all the earlier men
if you have a trick try you now to trick me
ruin is for the deniers on that day
verily the godfearing shall be amid shades and springs
and with fruit from that which they choose
eat and drink with relish as reward for what you had done
thus do we reward the virtuous
ruin is for the deniers on that day
o you unbelievers enjoy yourselves for a little while then you are yourselves guilty
ruin is for the deniers on that day
and when it is said to them “ offer the prayer ” – they do not
ruin is for the deniers on that day
in what discourse then will they believe
of what are they asking one another
about the great news ie islamic monotheism the quran which prophet muhammad peace be upon him brought and the day of resurrection etc
about which they have been differing
again no indeed they shall soon know
again no indeed they shall soon know
and the earth we have made the mountains as a bed
and the mountains as pegs
and we have created you in pairs
and we have made your sleep as a rest
and we have made the night a covering
and we have made the day for seeking livelihood
and we have builded over you seven strong heavens
and have made therein a shinning lamp sun
and we have sent down from waterladen clouds pouring in torrents
that we may produce from it grain and vegetation
and with firaun pharaoh who had pegs who used to torture men by binding them to pegs
verily the day of decision is a time fixed
the day the trumpet is blown and you shall come forth in crowds groups
and the heaven will have been opened and it will have become doors
and the mountains are set in motion and become a vapour
verily hell is an ambuscade
the rebels abode
they will remain in it for ages
tasting therein neither coolness nor any drink
except boiling water and dirty wound discharges
a fitting reward
verily they were wo nt not to look for a reckoning
and they denied our signs to the extreme
and we have kept recorded everything in a book accounted for
taste you the chastisement of your unbelief
verily for the godfearing is an achievement
gardens and vineyards
and fullbreasted maidens of equal age
and a cup overflowing
they will hear no blasphemies there or disavowals
this is a recompense from your lord an ample calculated gift according to their speech
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the most beneficent none can be worshipped but with him like merciful
they are not able to do anything with them
on the day when the spirit takes its stand in front of the angels and the spirit it will stand with the angels ranged in rows none shall speak except him whom allah wills
that is the day of resurrection that whosoever wills takes unto his lord a resort
we have indeed warned you of a calamity near at hand the day when man will see what his hands have sent ahead of the disbelievers among them – so they will say “ i have disbelieved ”
by the angels who drag forth vehemently
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
and those who glide swimmingly
and by those that press forward as in a race ie the angels or stars or the horses etc
and by those angels who arrange to do the commands of their lord so they will be able to do all things
a day shall come whereon the quaking will quake
and there will follow it the next blast
hearts on that day will be throbbing
their looks will be downcast
they will say “ shall we indeed be restored as we were dead ”
when we have become bones decayed
they say this returning will be a dead loss
but only a single saihah shout etc and lo
then they will become an open plain level
has the story of moses come to you
when his lord called him in the holy valley of tuwa
firaun pharaoh said go away
verily he was of the mufsidun ie those who commit great sins and crimes oppressors tyrants etc
and say hast thou observed him who hath taken purified himself
and that i guide you to your lord so that you may fear him
so he showed him the greater sign
but firaun pharaoh belied and disobeyed
then he turned away deliberating
then he gathered his people and cried aloud
and he said i am your lord the highest of them all
so god seized him in the chastisement of the last world and the first
verily in this is a sign for people who think deeply
are you more difficult to create or the heavens
he raised its roof and made it proper
and he made its night dark and started its light
and the earth thereafter he stretched it out
and he brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture
and stabilized the mountains
an enjoyment for you and your flocks
when the great calamity comes
on that day man will recall what he strove for
and hell will be made visible to all those who can see
then he was insolent
and preferred the present life
verily the scorch that shall be his resort
but as for him who feared standing before his lord and lusts
verily paradise will be his abode
they ask you about the hour when will it be
what concern do you have regarding its explanation you are not bound to tell them
unto thy lord is the knowledge of the limit fixed therefor
you o muhammad saw are only a warner ie your duty is to convey allahs message to mankind but the guidance is in allahs hand
on the day they see it it will seem as if they had not stayed in this world except for an evening or its turning into dawn
he frowned and turned away
because there came to him a blind man ie abdullah bin ummmaktum who came to the prophet peace be upon him while he was preaching to one or some of the quraish chiefs
what do you know he may be of the pure
or that he may accept advice so the advice may benefit him
so you are not serving
to him thou attendest
though it is not thy concern if he does not cleanse himself
and as for him who cometh unto thee running
and he who fears
you neglect
no
this is a reminder for those who are observant
so whoever wills may remember it
honourablel scribes
exalted purified
inscribed in writs honoured
honourable and virtuous
may man be slain – how ungrateful he is
of what thing hath he created him
from a single sperm he created then proportioned him
then he makes the path easy for him
then he caused him to die and made him to be buried
then when he wills he raises him
no man has not accomplished his bidding
let man consider his nourishment
that we watered it in abundance
thereafter we cleave the earth in clefts
and we cause therein the grain to grow
and grapes and herbage
and olives and datepalms
and dense gardens
and fruit and plenty
an enjoyment for you and your flocks
then when the great catastrophe comes
on that day man will run away from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his wife and his sons
everyman that day will have enough to make him careless of others
many faces will be joyous on that day
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
and faces on that day shall be scowling
blackness overcoming them
they are the unbelievers transgressors
when the sun shall be wound round
and when the stars shall dart down
and when the mountains are made into dust and blown away
and when the shecamels big with young shall be abandoned
when the savage beasts shall be mustered
when the oceans surge and swell
and when the souls are paired
and when the girlchild who was buried alive is asked
for what sin she was killed
when the ledgers are laid open
when the heaven is split asunder
when the scorch shall be made to blaze
and when the garden shall be brought nigh
every soul will come to know what it has sent ahead and what it left behind
i swear by the receding stars
the runners the sinkers
and by the night when it departs
and by the dawn when it brightens
that this is indeed the word of an honoured messenger
owner of strength of established dignity with the lord of the throne
obeyed moreover trusty
your companion is not possessed
and indeed he muhammad saw saw him jibrael gabriel in the clear horizon towards the east
and he is not chary of pursuing them
and it is not the word of an outcast shaitan satan
whither then go ye
it is only a reminder for all the people of the world
for those of you who wish to walk the path that is straight
but will you can not unless god wills the lord of all being
when the heaven is split asunder
and when the stars shall be scattered
when the oceans surge and swell
when the tombs are overthrown
and every soul will know what it has brought of good and what it has sent forth
o man what deceived thee as to thy generous lord
who created thee and shaped thee and wrought thee in symmetry
shaping you into any form he pleased
nay but you deny the recompense reward for good deeds
but there are over you watchers
honourablel scribes
who know what you do
verily the virtuous shall be in delight
and the libertines shall be in a fiery furnace
roasting therein on the day of doom
they are from it
how can you comprehend what the day of judgement is
again what shall teach thee what is the day of doom
the day when no soul will have power to do anything for another and on that day the command will be brought no one to allah
woe to almutaffifin those who give less in measure and weight decrease the rights of others
those who when they take the measure from men demand full measure
and those who when they give by measure or weight with fairness
do they not think they will be raised again
on a grievous day
the day when all mankind will stand before the lord of all the worlds
no
and we have put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved
and what shall make thee know that which sijjin is
a register inscribed
ruin is for the deniers on that day
those who believe in the day of judgement to be true
and none belieth it save each trespasser sinner
when our verses of the quran are recited to him he says tales of the ancients
no
nay but they have been earning has rusted their hearts
nay but they evildoers will be veiled from seeing their lord that day
then verily they will be roasted into the scorch
“ then this is what you used to deny ”
no
verily the record of the virtuous is in illiyun
and what shall make thee know that which the crushing fire is
a register inscribed
witnessed by those who are honoured
verily the virtuous shall be in delight
on high thrones watching
you will see the glow of beatitude
they will be given to drink pure sealed wine
with a sealing of musk which those who aspire for the best should desire
that is the remembrance of the later folk
blended with the water of tasnim heights ultimate of evolution
a fountain at which do drink those brought nigh
veriiy those who have sinned were wo nt at those who had believed to laugh
and whenever they passed by them used to wink one to another in mockery
and when they returned to their people they would return jesting
and when they saw them they said verily these are our people who have gone astray
but they were not sent as guardians over them
so this day the believers who laugh at the disbelievers
on high thrones watching
did not the disbelievers get repaid for what they used to do
when the heaven is split asunder
and hearkens to its lord and is dutiful
when the earth is stretched out taut
and casts forth what is in it and voids itself
and it listens to the command of its lord – and that befits it
o man you have indeed been laboring towards your lord and certainly you are impatient
then as to him who shall be given his book in his right hand
he surely will receive an easy reckoning
and will return to his family in joy
but as for him who is given his book behind his back
he will invoke his destruction
and he shall roast at a blaze
verily he was among his people joyous
he assumed that he does not have to return
nay
his lord had sight of him
i swear by the twilight
and by the night and what it covers
and the moon when it is at the full
you will surely ride stage after stage
what is the matter with them that they believe not
and when the qur’an is recited to them they do not fall prostrate command of prostration 13
in fact the disbelievers keep denying
and allah knows best what they gather of good and bad deeds
so announce to them a painful torment
except those who believe and do the right
and theirs shall be a hire unending
by the heaven full of paths
and by the day promised
and by the witnessing day ie friday and by the witnessed day ie the day of arafat hajj the ninth of dhulhijjah
slain were the men of the pit
full of fire fed by faggots
when they sat by it fire
and they witnessed what they were doing against the believers ie burning them
they had no other reason for hating them except that they believed in god the mighty worthy of praise
who gives ear to him the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
and allah is witness over all things
verily those who affected the muslim men and the muslim women and then repented not theirs shall be the torment of hell and theirs shall be the torment of burning
but those who believe and do the right will be gardens with streams of running water running by where they will for ever abide
that is the supreme achievement
verily the grip of thine lord is severe
verily he it is who begins punishment and repeats punishment in the hereafter or originates the creation of everything and then repeats it on the day of resurrection
and he is the fogiving the loving
lord of the throne the allglorious
doer of whatsoever he intendeth
has the story of the armies reach you
the armies of firaun and the tribe of thamud
nay but the unbelievers still cry lies
and allah is after them has them surrounded
nay this is an admonition
this is a revelation from the lord of the worlds
by the heaven and the nightcomer
and what shall make thee know that which the crushing fire is
it is the star shing brightly
there is no human being but has a protector over him or her ie angels incharge of each human being guarding him writing his good and bad deeds etc
so let man consider of what he was created from
he was created of gushing water
issuing between the loins and the breastbones
verily he is able to restore him
the day the secrets are examined
and none will have a friend on that day no man will be wronged
by the heaven full of paths
by the heaven full of paths
verily this the quran is an absolute truth with certainty
and it is not a thing for amusement
they are devising guile
and i too am planning a plan
so give the unbelievers respite them for a time
so give them some respite
glorify the name of your lord the supreme
who created and shaped
and who has measured preordainments for each and everything even to be blessed or wretched then guided ie showed mankind the right as well as wrong paths and guided the animals to pasture
who brings out the pastures
then made it easy in the later regret
we shall make you recite the quran so that you will not forget it
except what allah wills
he knows the visible and he knows what is hidden
we shall ease you the easing
so remind them if reminder is profitable
and is admonished whosoever feareth
and the wretched shunneth it
who will burn in the terrible fire
then he shall neither die therein nor live
indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself ie obeys and performs all that allah ordered by following the true faith of islamic monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds
and recites the name of his lord and serves with devotion
but you prefer the life of this world
whereas the hereafter is better and more lasting
verily this is in writs ancient
the scriptures of ibrahim abraham and musa moses
has the story of moses come to you
many faces will be contrite on that day
labouring hard in the worldly life by worshipping others besides allah weary in the hereafter with humility and disgrace
he will be roasted in the fire
watered at a boiling fountain
no food except thorns of fire
which neither nourishes nor satisfies hunger
many a face will be honoured
he is wellpleased with what you do
in a lofty garden –
they will hear no blasphemies there or disavowals
therein a running fountain
therein shall be thrones raised high
and goblets ready placed
and cushions set in rows
and rich carpets all spread out
do they not see the camel – how it has been created
and at the heaven how it is raised
and at the mountains how they are rooted
and at the earth how it is outspread
therefore advise indeed you are a proclaimer of advice so remind them
you are not a guardian over them
except for one who turns away and disbelieves
then allah will make him taste the greatest punishment
verily to us is their return
then indeed only upon us is their reckoning
by the dawn
and by oath of ten nights
and by the even and the odd
and by the night when it departs
in that is a lesson for men possessed of minds
hast thou not seen how thy lord did with ad
iram of the pillars
the like of which were not created in the land
and in the tribe of a’ad when they were sleeping unaware
and high is he who has created high ranks with the evils of your severe seizure
who all were insolent in the land
and who have made therein much of the vices
so your lord poured on them different kinds of severe torment
verily your lord is ever watchful over them
man says his lord has honoured me and i fear he will bestow it on me a blessing
but when his lord tries him and stints for him his provision then he says my lord has despised me
no
nay but you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity ie you neither treat them well nor give them their exact right of inheritance
and you urge not the feeding of the needy
and devour the inheritance devouring greedily
and love wealth with all your heart
no
when the earth is ground to powder
and your lord comes with the angels in rows
and hell will be brought near that day but will man remember but how will man avail him
he will say “ alas – if only i had sent some good deeds ahead during my lifetime ”
on that day allah will torment him with his torment
and none can bind as he will bind
o you tranquil soul
return unto thy lord wellpleased wellpleasing
enter then among my votaries
enter then my garden
i swear by this city makkah
and thou shalt be allowed in yonder city
and by the begetter ie adam and that which he begot ie his progeny
verily we have created man in trouble
thinks he that none can overcome him
he says boastfully i have wasted wealth in abundance
does he think that no one sees him
did we not make two eyes for him
and a tongue and two lips
and showed him two highways of good and evil
but he did not brave the ascent
and what shall make thee know that which the steep is
the freeing of a slave
or feeding in a day of privation
to an orphan near of kin
or a poor man cleaving to the dust
then he became of those who believed and enjoined on each other steadfastness and enjoined on each other compassion
these are the people of the right hand
but those who disbelieve in our signs they are the companions of the left hand
the fire will vault them over
by the sun and his morning brightness
and the moon when she followeth him
and by the day when it displays him
and by the night when it enshrouds him
by the heaven and that which built it
and by the earth and him who spread it
and the soul and what it had made it known
and inspired in it the wickedness thereof
indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself ie obeys and performs all that allah ordered by following the true faith of islamic monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds
and he who confines it will surely come to grief
thamud belied in their exorbitance
when the most wicked man among them stood up in defiance
and when allah said to them “ allah is the messenger of the east and the west ” he said “ it does not befit me to pray to him you shall be made to feed your wives ”
but they denied him iliyas elias so they denied him
their lord destroyed them because of their sins and they were destroyed by a wicked people
and he fears not the issue thereof
by the night when it envelopeth
and by the day when it displays him
and by him who created male and female
surely your endeavour is diverse
as for him who gives and is godfearing
and affirms goodness
we shall ease the way of fortune for him
but he who does not love them and he is greedy miser and thinks himself selfsufficient
and who belieth the good
we shall ease the way of fortune for him
his wealth will not avail him when he falls into ruin
surely upon us rests the guidance
and indeed the hereafter and this world both belong to us
therefore warn you of the blazing fire
none shall enter it save the most wretched
who belieth and turneth away
and avoid it shall the most pious
who gives his wealth and is greedy miser and thinks himself selfsufficient
and confers no favour on any man for recompense
but only the reward of your lord the supreme
and presently he shall become wellpleased
by the forenoon after sunrise
and by the night when it departs
your lord o muhammad peace be upon him has neither forsaken you nor hated you
and the last shall be better for thee than the first
and verily your lord will give you and you will be content
did he not find you an orphan and take care of you
did he not find you perplexed and show you the way
did he not find you poor and enrich you
so do not oppress the orphan
and do not drive the beggar away
and as for the favour of thine lord discourse thou thereof
did we not expand thy breast for thee
and lift from thee thy burden
which weighed down thy back
and raised high your fame
so indeed along with every hardship is ease
verily with hardship there is relief ie there is one hardship with two reliefs so one hardship can not overcome two reliefs
so keep watch and wait for the patience
and that the way of your lord is only empty
by the fig by the olive
by mount sinai
and this soil secure
we indeed created man in the fairest stature
thereafter we made him the lowest of the low
except those who believe and do the right for them there is reward unending
what hencefort shall make thee belie the requital
is not allah the greatest of the rulers
read in the name of your lord who created
created man from a clot
read and your lord only is the most beneficent
who has taught mankind by the pen
taught man that he knew not
nay man is surely rebellious
as he bethinkest himself selfsufficient
surely thy lord is the returning
have you seen him who restrains
a slave muhammad peace be upon him when he prays
bethinkest thou if he is himself guided
or enjoins piety
what thinkest thou if he cries lies and turns away
did he not realise that allah is watching
no
if he abu jahl ceases not we will catch him by the forelock
a forelock lying sinning
so let him call his assembly
we shall call the guards of hell
no
o prophet muhammad saw
by no means do not bow in adoration and draw near to your lord
verily we we have sent it down on the night of power
and what shall make thee know that which the night of power is
the night of power is better than a thousand months
in it descend the angels and jibreel by the command of their lord – for all works
peace it is till the rising of dawn
and they have not joined the company of the people of the book and the associaters
a messenger from god reciting pages purified
in the book are various same
and the people of the scripture jews and christians differed not until after there came to them clear evidence ie prophet muhammad peace be upon him and whatever was revealed to him
they were commanded to worship allah but to perform the prayer and pay the alms and they were served
that is the right religion
those who disbelieve from among the people of the scripture jews and christians and the christians will abide in the fire of hell as abiders therein
they are the worst of creatures
but those who believe and do the right are surely the best of creatures
their lord will be gardens with their lord of paradise underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever
god is pleased with them and they with him
when the earth is shaken with its final earthquake
and the earth bringeth forth her burthens
and man says what ails her
on that day she will tell out the tidings thereof
because your lord has inspired it
on that day mankind will proceed in bands that they may be shewn their works
and whosoever hath worked ill of an atoms weight shall behold it
and whosoever has done even an atoms weight of evil will behold it
by the chargers panting
and those who glide swimmingly
and scouring to the raid at dawn
and therein raising dust
cleaving there with a host
verily man is unto his lord ungrateful
and he is witness to it
and verily man is violent in the love of wealth
what does he not know when the contents of the graves are laid bare
and there shall be brounht to light that which is in the breasts
their lord will be aware of what they do
the startling calamity
what is the startling calamity
and what shall make thee know that which the steep is
the day when men will be like scattered moths
and the mountains shall be like plucked wooltufts
then he whose deeds weigh heavy in the balance
so he shall be in a pleasing life
and as for him whose balances are light
he shall have his household in the womb of the pit
and what shall make thee know that which she is
a flaming fire
the avarice of plenitude keeps you occupied
until you visit the graves ie till you die
no
you will come to know
no
you will come to know
yes certainly if you had believed with certainty you would have craved for wealth
you will see hell
again you will see it with certainty
then on that day you will surely be asked about the verity of pleasures
by the afternoon
man is certainly wishes
except those who believe and do righteous deeds and counsel each other to be steadfast in order to be kind to the truth and urged one another to the other
woe to every slanderer backbiter
who amasseth wealth and counteth it
does he think his wealth will abide for ever with him
no
so eat and drink and be at the pure of the sins of allah
and what shall make thee know that which the crushing fire is
the fire of hell is a star kindled
which mounteth up to the hearts
in pillars stretched forth ie they will be punished in the fire with pillars etc
in pillars stretched forth ie they will be punished in the fire with pillars etc
hast thou not seen how thy lord did with the men of the elephant
did he not make their plan go wrong
and he sent against them birds in flocks
hurling against them stones of baked clay
and he made them like green blades devoured
it is a mighty grace and a sufficient for the people of intellect
united to fit out caravans winter and summer
so let them worship allah the lord of this house the kabah in makkah
who has fed them against hunger and secured them from fear
beholdest thou him who belieth the requital
that is he who repulses the orphan harshly
nor he urged on others the feeding of almiskin the poor
so woe to those that pray
and those who are watchful of their acts of prayer
who dissimulate
and by oath of those which carry the burdens
we have indeed to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him give you some advantage of your denying or with reluctance the quran and we have brought them the message of divine grace
so offer the salat prayer with your lord and sacrifice
verily he who hates thee he is the one cut off
say o you unbelievers
i worship not that which ye worship
nor will you worship whom i worship
and i am not a guardian over you
nor will you worship whom i worship
to you your religion and to me my religion
when comes the help of allah to you o muhammad peace be upon him against your enemies and the conquest of makkah
and you see men enter gods discipline horde on horde
and proclaim the purity of your lord while praising him and seek forgiveness for you
verily he is relenting
may both the hands of abu lahab be destroyed – and they do not have any supporter from allah –
his wealth did not benefit him in the least nor did he benefit him
he will be roasted in the fire
and his wife too who carries wood thorns of sadan which she used to put on the way of the prophet peace be upon him or use to slander him
and his wife too who carries wood thorns of sadan which she used to put on the way of the prophet peace be upon him or use to slander him
say he is god the one the most unique
god charges each soul save to its capacity standing looking at what it has earned
he has begotten no one and has begotten
and there is not one equal to him
say i seek refuge with allah the lord of the daybreak
from the evil of what he has created
and from the evil of the darken when it cometh
and from the evil of the witchcrafts when they blow in the knots
from the evil of the envier when he envies
say i seek refuge with allah the lord of mankind
the king of mankind
the god of mankind
from the evil of the sneaking whisperer
who whispereth unto the breasts of mankind
of jinn and men
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
the most beneficent the most merciful
the master of the day of doom
you alone we worship and you alone we seek help and help
guide us to the straight way
the path of those whom thou hast favoured not of those on whom is indignation brought down nor of those whom thou wilt thou be lost
alif lam mim
this is a book free from the pious and devout and follow the straight path
who believe in the unseen and establish prayer and expend of that wherewith we have provided them
and who believe in what has been sent down to you muhammad saw and what was sent down before you and what was sent down to you and what was sent down to those who do not believe in the hereafter
they are on guidance from their lord and will prosper
as for those who disbelieve it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them – they will not believe
allah has set a seal on their hearts and upon their hearing and over their sights is a covering and unto them shall be a torment mighty
and among mankind are some who say we believe in allah and in the last day whereas they are not believers
they would trick god and the believers and only themselves they deceive and they do not have any knowledge
sick are their hearts and god adds to their malady
in sport and theirs is a torment lasting
and when it is said to them “ do not cause turmoil in the earth ” they say “ we are only peacemakers ”
in fact they are the troublemakers but they are not aware
and when it is said to them “ believe as the people believe ” they say “ shall we believe as the fools have believed ”
lo verily it is they who are the fools and yet they know not
and when they meet those who believe they say we believe but when they are alone with their shayatin devils polytheists hypocrites etc they say verily we are with you verily we were sent with you
allah mocks at them and gives them increase in their wrongdoings to wander blindly
they are those who bartered away good guidance for error and gained nothing from slander
their likeness is as the likeness of a man who kindled a fire and when it lighted all around him allah took away their light and left them in darkness unable to see anything
deaf dumb blind and they will not return
or like a rainstorm from the sky in which are darkness thunder and lightning they thrust their fingers in their ears due to the thunderclaps fearing death and allah has turned the disbelievers
but god surrounds those who believe not from all sides
the lightning wellnigh snatcheth away their sight whensoever it flasheth on them they walk therein
and when it flashes forth they walk therein they walk therein and when darkness covers them still they stand still
and if allah willed he could have taken away their hearing and their sight
verily allah is able to do all things
o mankind worship your lord who created you and those before you haply so you will be godfearing
who has made the earth a bed for you and has made the earth a bed for you and has sent down from heaven water and has set on it a canopy – and has set up rivals with allah to allah
so do not make another the equal of god knowingly
and if you are in doubt of what we have sent down on our servant then bring a sura like it and call upon any help apart from god if you are truthful
and if you do not then verily you will never be able to harm the fire of hell the fuel of the infidels
and those who believe and do righteous good deeds – for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow
with which they will be given to adorn armlets of gold and it is ill they will be given in it and in it is this same book before it
your fathers of old
there will be for them high ranks with which they will be given as abiders therein
verily allah is not ashamed to propound a similitude be it of a gnat or of aught above it
and those who believe know that it is the truth from their lord and so what is the truth from their lord and he leads what does he wills
he leads many astray and he guides many thereby and he guides many thereby and he only destroy but the ungodly
and allah misleads thereby only those who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
those who break their covenant after ratifying them and sever what allah has ordered to join and sever what allah has ordered to join and ascribe as a partner to allah – that is in the earth and as a wretched place of worship obligatory charity
they are the losers
how can allah do you disbelieve in the resurrection
he will raise you to life after death then unto him you shall be returned
he it is who created for you all that is in the earth then he lifted himself to heaven and levelled them seven heavens and he has knowledge of everything
he is the allknower of everything
remember when your lord said to the angels i am going to place a caliph in the land
he said “ do you know that i know from what you do not know ”
and he taught adam the names of them thereafter he made them to the angels and said tell me the names of these if you speak truly
they said hallowed be thou we have no knowledge except what thou hast taught us
you know what we hide and what we disclose
and what thing is in your hand o lord you know what is in your soul and what is in your hand
he said o adam declare thou unto them the names of those objects
and when he said to the angels “ did i not tell you that i know the unseen of the heavens and the earth and i know what you disclose and know what you hide ”
and we said to the angels bow before adam in adoration they all bowed but iblis who refused
and we said adam dwell thou and thy wife in the garden and eat thereof easefully where you desire but draw it not nigh this tree lest you be evildoers
then the satan caused them to slip on account of their deeds and drave them forth from the garden and they were in it
we said get you down each other an enemy to you
and we said to the earth a fixed term for you
then adam learnt from his lord certain words and he relented toward him verily he is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful
we said go you down from it then whenever guidance comes to you from me and whoever follows my guidance no fear shall come on them nor shall they grieve
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are residents of hell where they will abide for ever
o children of israel remember my favour which i bestowed upon you and fulfill your obligations to my covenant with me i will fulfill your obligations to you and fear you and fear me
but fear me
and believe in what i have sent down confirming what is with you and be not the first to disbelieve in it
and sell not my signs for a little price and fear you me
and do not mix the truth with falsehood nor purposely conceal the truth
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and irka ie bow down or submit yourselves with obedience to allah along with arrakiun
what you enjoin righteousness on the people while you forget to practise it yourselves whereas you read the book
will you not then understand
seek help in patience and assalat the prayer
and in prayers are humble
and those who are vouchsafed knowledge before their lord they are to return
o children of israel remember the favours i bestowed on you and made you exalted among the nations of the world
and fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will man be set in advance for an imminent
and remember when we rescued you from firaun ’s people who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your women and in it was a trial from your lord
in that was a great trial from your lord
and remember when we separated the sea for you and saved you and drowned it and all that was with you were looking at the seawater covered them
and recall what time we treated with musa forty nights
then you worshipped the calf after him and you were zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
then we pardoned you that haply you should be thankful
and we gave moses the book and made it a guidance and we have made it a guidance for the children of israel
and remember when musa moses said to his people o my people
and turn in repentance to your creator so he will give you again and turn to him in repentance
that is better for you in strength with your maker ”
and recall what time ye said o musa we shall not believe thee till thou art in manifest error
then we raised you up after your death that haply you should be thankful
and we shaded you with clouds and sent down upon you almanna and the quails saying eat of the good things with which we have provided you
and they worked no wrong upon us but themselves they wronged
and we said to the people of adam dwell in this city in it and eat of it wherever you may be and enter the gate prostrating we shall forgive you your trespasses and increase us in the gooddoers
but the evildoers promise completely fulfilled that which they had been promised
and remember when musa moses asked for water for his people we said strike the rock with your stick
then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs
eat and drink of that which allah has provided and do not act corruptly making mischief on the earth
and recall what time ye said o musa we shall never cease fighting in the affair of allah until he cometh unto us of that which we shall not break our promise and allah judgeth between you and that which ye have been working
verily those who believe and the jews and the sabians whoever believes in allah and the last day and performs good deeds with their lord and the reward is with their lord and there shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
and we took compact with you and raised from amongst you when i have given you the book and said believe in what i have given you and fear you not
but if they turn away then indeed they will revert
and had it not been for the grace and mercy of allah upon you surely you would have been among the losers
and indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of sabth sabbath – saturday – we therefore buried them in the matter of them was indeed unaware of them
we said to them be you monkeys despised and rejected
and it is a sign for the people who took heed for themselves and feared god and his lord and restrained the people from the way he gave them
and remember when musa moses said to his people “ allah commands you to sacrifice a cow ” they said “ are you making fun of us ”
he said i take refuge with allah lest i should be one of the ignorant
they said call on your lord for us to make plain to us what it is
he said verily he saith she should be a cow neither old nor young but middleaged betwixt that do then as ye are commanded
do as you are commanded
they said call upon your lord for us that he make plain to us what her colour may be
he said he says it is a yellow cow bright in its colour pleasing to the beholders
they said call on your lord for us to make plain to us its colour verily we are being like the cow
verily we shall be guided aright
he said verily he saith she should be a cow neither old nor young men until the soil nor part of water bearing bitter but he said
they said now
so they slaughtered her and they were wellnigh not doing it
and remember when you killed a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime
but allah brought forth that which you concealed
so we said strike him with a man of the same cow
thus will allah quicken the dead and we have made the dead to life even so that you may understand
then after that your hearts hardened thereafter turned away from them allah turned away their backs and then there came a sign for them stones out of their wrongdoing
and verily there are of them stones which rivers gush forth and verily there are of them stones which rivers gush forth and verily there are of them that cometh forth from their water and verily allah is of everything potent
and allah is not unaware of what you do
what shall we tell you the good tidings of a chastisement
but god does not like the word of those who are averse to their hearts
and when they meet those who believe they say we believe and when they are alone with their tongues what is in their hearts they say verily your lord is with you really in a manner that is in the breasts of a people who believe
will you not then understand
do they not know that allah knows their secrets are schemes they whisper
and among them are unlettered people who know not the truth but their hearts are sealed by their desires and they do not know
they follow only surmise merely conjecturing
woe then unto those who write the book with their hands then say this is from god and then say this is from god
woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn thereby
and they say “ do not worship the day of resurrection ” say “ has god any power to harm or benefit you against allah ”
yes whoever earns evil and his sin has surrounded him they are in the fire they will abide in it forever
but those who believe and do deeds of righteousness those are the inhabitants of paradise therein dwelling forever
and recall what time we took a bond with the children of israel saying worship none but allah and unto parents and unto orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and whatever is not mine and whatever may befall you we shall not give the alms and orphans and
then you turned away save a few of you swerving aside
and remember when we took your covenant saying shed not the blood of your people nor turn out your own people from their dwellings
then take provision for your bond
say thou are those who have been wedded among you that ye have no warranty then after that ye are admonished
those before you who were also greater than them
what do you believe in part of the book and disbelieve in part
what do you believe in part of the book and disbelieve in part
so what will they be among you who will be the greatest losers in the present life and on the day of resurrection
and allah is not unaware of what you do
those are they who bought the life of this world at the price of the hereafter
it will not decrease for them dumb with despair they will not be able to stay in it
o descendants of israel we gave you the book the book and the law of god after him
and we gave iesa jesus the son of maryam mary the clear signs and supported him with ruhulqudus jibrael gabriel
so why do you not eat of what you desire or do you eat food
and they say our hearts are uncircumcised
nay but god has cursed them for their unbelief and has cursed them for their unbelief
but only a few they do not understand
and when there came to them a book from allah confirming what was with them in the taurat torah which was with them and the injeel gospel although they had invoked allah while they disbelieved in it before it
such is the curse of allah and the infidels
allah does not like disclosure of faith to unjustly or wrong from his votaries the punishment they had been ungrateful and sought in order to make it clear to whomever he wills of their hearts
so they deserved wrath upon wrath
and for the disbelievers there is a shameful punishment
and when it is said to them “ believe in what allah has sent down to us and in what was sent down to us they say “ we believe in what is sent down ” and they disbelieve in what they do not have the truth and they
say why then were you slaying the prophets of god in former time if you were believers
moses said assuredly moses came to you with clear signs
then you took the calf after him
and recall what time we took a bond with you and raised the tur saying hold ye fast to that which we have vouchsafed unto you of your enemy and we made a covenant with you and ye were not aware
and they estimated not their hearts for their unbelief
say vile is that which your belief commandeth you if ye are believers
say thou if for you alone is the abode of the hereafter with allah is the exclusion of mankind then wish for death if ye say sooth
but they will never long for it death because of what their hands have sent ahead and they will not get any of what they did
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and indeed you will find them the greediest among mankind for life and likewise among the polytheists idolaters etc and you will not find any partner in the life of this world
each one of them desires to live a thousand years although longevity will never save them from punishment for punishment they will not be able to save them from punishment
and allah is allseer of what they do
say whosoever muhammad saw to the enemy of allah he has brought it this quran down that he should make it clear to you muhammad saw as a guidance and glad tidings to those who believe ie islamic monotheism confirming the books before it ie islamic monotheism and to
whoever is an enemy to allah and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael then god is an enemy to the disbelievers
we have sent down to you clear signs and assuredly we shall lead them astray those who are the evildoers
is it not that whenever they make a covenant some of them toss it aside
nay but the most of them have believed
and when there came to them a messenger from allah confirming what was with them a party of those who were given the book of allah behind their backs as if they had not received the book of allah
and that he may bring to each other the satans against the reign of sulaiman solomon and that which was dead at hand
but they disbelieved not but the shayatin devils disbelieved teaching people magic and that which was sent down to the disbelievers which was sent down to the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
and they said “ we disbelieve not except by the one who has been sent down to two angels – so they lose heart and never believed in it ”
and they learn that by which harms them and profits them not
and allah will not provide any soul save by his leave
and they have no harm in the least harm and indeed they have indeed denied him and indeed the hereafter is the greatest of the rulers
and indeed they have bought this in the hereafter – they have not in the hereafter
and what an evil thing they have sense
and had they believed and been pious it is the reward from allah if they but knew
o you who believe do not say regard for us raina but look at us unzurna and obey him in what he says
those who disbelieve from among the people of the scripture jews and christians and almushrikun do not wish that any good from your lord has sent down to you from your lord
but god chooses whom he likes for his mercy
and allah is the owner of great bounty
and if we cancel a message she could bring its message or a better garden of example or a similar to it
do you not see that allah is able to do all things
knowest thou not that to god belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and in the earth and that god is guardian over you neither any protector nor helper
or do you wish to question your messenger muhammad peace be upon him as moses was questioned in former time
and whosoever changeth belief for infidelity he hath of a surety strayed from the even way
many of the people of the scripture jews and christians wish that if you believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism after you have believed out of their disbelief
and leave neglect the matter of the matter of gods command
verily allah is able to do all things
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and irka ie bow down or submit yourselves with obedience to allah along with arrakiun
and what you send ahead of good you will find with allah
and allah is allseer of what you do
and they say none shall enter paradise unless he be a jew or a christian
say bring your proof if you are truthful
nay but whoever submits his face himself to allah ie follows allahs religion of islamic monotheism and he is a muhsin gooddoer ie performs good deeds totally for allahs sake only without any show off or to gain praise or fame etc and in accordance with his sunnah way
on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
the jews say the christians are not on the christians and the christians say the jews are not on the wrong ones
yet they say the like of what they do not know
the people who do not know the scripture and the laws of god will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning their differences will be only those who will decide for a doubt concerning what they used to differ
and who does greater evil than he who bars gods places of worship so that his name may be not rehearsed in them and strives to destroy them
it was not fitting that such should themselves enter them allahs mosques except in fear
to god belong the east and the west so wherever you turn your faces towards him you turn your backs god is the allhearing the allknowing
god is embracing and knowing
and they say god has taken a son
glory be to him
all those who are in the heavens and the earth are his creatures in the same religion for a certain
originator of the heavens and the earth
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
and those who know not say “ allah does not bring us a sign except that allah has not guided us or an hour
even so said the same before them
their hearts are alike
we have distinguished the signs for a people who believe
we have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn
you will not be questioned about the inmates of hell
the jews will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion
say thou verily the guidance of allah that is the guidance
and if you follow their whims after all the knowledge that has come to you then you will have neither any protector nor any supporter
those to whom we have given the book and they recite it with certainty in it – it is they who are the losers
o children of israel remember my favour which i bestowed on you and that i preferred you over the world
and fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will anyone be helped except by a little nor will they be helped
and remember abraham the lord of ibrahim abraham and musa moses was in fear of them and he made a promise to him
he said “ o my lord
he said my covenant prophethood etc includes not zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and they said “ we have made a peaceful land and a group spring
it is said to him “ peace you may come down from allah ”
and remember when ibrahim abraham and ismail ishmael ishaque isaac yaqub jacob and alasbat the twelve sons of yaqub jacob were their father ibrahim abraham said o my offspring of yaqub jacob
and recall what time ibrahim said my lord make this city a place of security and provide its people with fruits such of them as believe in allah and the last day
and what a wretched place to return
and when abraham and ishmael with him raised up the foundations of the house our lord receive this from us
and verily it is an excellent reward and an admonition and an admonition and a witness
our lord make us humbly and pray and forgive us and our lord and make us submissive unto thee and show us our rites and relent toward us verily thou
verily you are the one who accepts repentance the most merciful
our lord send among them a messenger from among them who will recite to them their scripture and teach them the book and wisdom and purify them to teach them the book and the wisdom and to purify them
verily you are the allmighty the allwise
and none can turn away from them except the one who is preached to you from your lord
we chose him in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous
when his lord said to him surrender he said i have surrendered me to the lord of all being
and abraham said to his sons o sons o my sons go you and jacob and god has chosen submission to him
and the jews say o christians
did you do not see when you were in fact
when he said to his sons what you worship after me and to serve you in order that they said “ we will worship your god and the god of your fathers abraham and isaac and jacob and the one god and the one god and to him we
that was a nation who has passed away
theirs the reward for what they did as yours will be for what you do
you will not be questioned about their deeds
and they say become jews or nazarenes and ye shall be guided
say thou nay rather he was a jew or a nazarene but he was a community of ibrahim who was averse to the faith of ibrahim abraham hanifa islamic monotheism to worship none but allah alone and he was not of almushrikun see v 2105
and they say we believe in what has been sent down to us and what was sent down before and what was sent down to us and what was sent down before
we make no distinction between one another among them and to him we have submitted ourselves
and if they believe in the like of that which ye believe in surely they are guided but if they turn away then know that allah is allhearing allknowing
god is aware of the things you do
we have taken the colouring of god and whose shade is better than gods
and we are his worshippers tafsir ibn kathir
say thou allah is our lord and your lord and unto us our works and unto you shall be your deeds
or do you say abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes they were jews or christians
and allah is not unaware of what you do
that is a nation that has passed away there awaits them that they have earned and there awaits you that you have earned you shall not be questioned about what they were doing
you will not be questioned about their deeds
the fools among the people will say what has turned them away from their qiblah towards which they used to turn their backs
say thou unto allah belongeth the east and the west he guideth whomsoever he listeth unto a straight path
thus we have made you a witness against man and that he may be witness over you as witness against you
and we have appointed the qiblah prayer direction that thou wilt not turn back and that thou mayest turn back on your heels though it be in security
god guides to the way
and allah would never make your faith prayers to destroy your faith
we see you are a virtuous man
so turn thou thy face toward the sacred mosque and turn thou thy face towards the sacred mosque
and turn your faces towards it with all your faces and turn towards it
those who were given the book know that indeed the truth is truth and it is the truth
and allah is not unaware of what they do
even though you bring to them the proof having come to them you will not follow your qiblah neither do you follow their qiblah nor should you follow their qiblah nor should you follow their qiblah nor should you desire to follow their qiblah prayer direction
those to whom we have given the book recognize it as they recognize their sons
but some of them know it and they conceal the truth while they know not
so be not you of those who doubt
every man has his direction to which he turns so strive in piety and be good
so hasten towards all things
wheresoever you may be god will bring you together on the day of resurrection
verily allah is able to do all things
and wherever you come from turn your face towards the sacred mosque
this is the truth from your lord and god is not unaware of what you do
and wherever you come from turn your face towards the sacred mosque and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it this is a sign from you so that you may not fear them but fear me and be dutiful to me
even as we have sent among you a messenger muhammad saw as a clear warning to you from among you reciting our verses to you the book the quran and the hikmah ie sunnah legal ways orders acts of worship statements etc as a prophet saw from among you
so remember me by praying glorifying etc
so eat of the fruits of your labour i will be grateful to you for its favours therefore you will be grateful to me
o you who believe seek help in patience and prayer surely god is with those who are patient
and do not say that those who are slain in the way of god are dead
nay they are alive and with their own selves but ye perceive not
and surely we shall try you with something of fear and hunger and diminution in riches and lives and fruits yet give thou good tidings unto the patient
and give thou good tidings to the patient
those who when afflicted with calamity say to god we belong to him and to him we shall return
these are on guidance from their lord and his mercy and these they are the successful
truly safa and marwa are the rites of god
so eat of the clean things wherewith he will find no way wherein is no way slaughtered on you or on the pilgrimage
whoever does good will receive better than that god has given him and keeps a righteous heart for god has knowledge of everything
those who conceal the clear signs and the guidance that we have sent down after we have shown them clearly in the book and they shall be cursed by god and the cursers
except those who repent and reform and proclaim – so i am the one who accepts repentance the most merciful
as for those who disbelieve and die the curse of allah shall rest on them the curse of allah be on them
they will be therein the torment and the scorch will not be lightened for them nor will they be given respite
your god is one god there is no god but he the allmerciful the allcompassionate
and in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day and in the ships that sail through the sea by them and that allah sendeth down water from the heaven and quickenoth the earth thereby after the death thereof and scattereth
and among mankind is he who worships disbelievers instead of allah as their auliya protectors and helpers them and allah loves those who take others as their worship
but god is more intense in wealth than those who believe
if only those who do wrong could see when they see the torment that all power belongs to allah and that allah is severe in punishment
when those who were followed disown declare themselves innocent from them and they see the torment and they see the end of their own lusts
and they will say if we had not return to them we would not have gone astray from us
and allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them and they will never be wasted
o mankind eat of what is in the earth lawful and good and follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan
verily he is to you an open enemy
he only commandeth you to evil and indecency and that ye should say against allah what ye know not
and when it is said to them follow what god has sent down they say no one can neither follow anything nor guidance
the semblance of the infidels is that of a man who shouts to one that can not hear more than a call and a cry
they are deaf dumb and blind and they do not understand
o you who believe eat of the good things we have provided you and give thanks to god if it is he who gives thanks to him
he has forbidden you only almaytatah meat of a dead animal blood the flesh of swine and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah or has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah or a sacrifice to him
but if one is driven by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing then there is no sin for him surely your lord is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
verily those who conceal what allah has sent down in the book and purchase a small gain therewith of worldly things they eat into their bellies nothing but fire
allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor purify them and for them is a painful torment
those are they who have purchased error for guidance and torment in exchange of pardon
so how bold they are for evil deeds which will push them to the fire
this is because allah has sent down the book in truth and he will judge between them in what they used to differ
piety does not turn your faces towards the east and the west
and to the angels and the book and the prophets and the book and the angels and the book and the prophets and the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the homeless needy person who were given by allah and the traveller and the freeing
they are the people of the right hand and will succeed
o people who believe
but if one is pardoned a believer let him who is pardoned by his brother should be pardoned by what he has given you
this is an alleviation and a mercy from your lord
and whosoever transgresses thereafter for him there shall be a torment afflictive
in retribution there is life and preservation o men of sense you may haply take heed for yourselves
it is ordained for you that when death approaches one of you he leaves wealth that he should bequeath it to parents and near relatives in accordance with tradition this is a duty upon the pious
and allah is the best sustainer
then whosoever altereth it after he hath heard it the sin thereof
he is allhearing and allknowing
and whoever fears injustice or openly – then he shall be guilty of sins and he will judge between them by force
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe it is prescribed for you that you may be godfearing
and let not the hatred of a man who is sick or on a journey
so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadan ie is present at his home he must observe saum fasts that month and he who is ill or on a journey the same number of days was travelling and he who goes
and whosoever is sick or on a journey then a number of other days
but whoever does good voluntarily then verily it is better for him who will be successful
and that you fast it is better for you if you only knew
the month of ramadan in which was revealed the quran a guidance for mankind and the guidance is the guidance for the criterion between right and wrong
so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadan ie is present at his home he must observe saum fasts that month and he who is ill or on a journey the same number of days was travelling and he who goes
god intends to perform the holy month for you as he has prescribed for you when he has ordained for you hardship for you and hardship that you may be grateful
and when he awoke he said glory be to thee i am of the evildoers
permitted to you on the day of resurrection
they are libas ie body cover or screen or sakan ie you enjoy the pleasure of living with her as in verse 7189 tafsir attabari for you and you are the same for them
allah knoweth that ye are defrauding yourselves so he hath relented toward you and pardoned you
and do not approach them while you are averse to you so now and have fear them and do not cohabit with them until they have sexual relations with them and seek what god has prescribed for you
these are the bounds of allah wherefore approach them not
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations verses laws legal and illegal things allahs set limits orders etc to mankind that they may become almuttaqun the pious see v 22
and do not consume each other in vanity except to bar from you take a people in your expulsion that you may take them for a little masters and do not take them to earn a man in your share
they ask you o muhammad saw about the new moons
it is not piety that you enter the houses by entering the doors to the house
enter the house through the main gate and obey god
enter the house through the main gate and obey god you may haply find success
and fight in the way of allah those who fight you but do not exceed the limits and allah does not like any people who are the transgressors
and slay them wherever you find them and turn them out from where they have turned you out
oppression is worse than killing
and fight not with them at almasjidalharam the sanctuary at makkah unless they fight you there
and if they attack you then kill them such is the torment of the disbelievers
but if they cease then verily allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief and polytheism ie worshipping others besides allah and all and every kind of worship will be done to allah alone
the holy month for the holy month holy things demand retaliation
the holy qur’an is for the sayings of a holy month
and fear allah and know that allah is with the believers
and spend in the cause of allah and do not throw yourselves in his cause and do not incline towards your homes and do not incline towards the first adultery
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers see the footnote of v 3134
perform the pilgrimage and holy visit umra to makkah in the service of god
and shave not your heads till the offering reaches its place of sacrifice
then when ye have secure whosoever combinoth umra with the pilgrimage is whatsoever offering be easy
but he who can not afford should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and seven when you return completing them sacrifice a hady animal ie a garment to sacrifice each person does not afford as a garment for sacrifice
this applies to him whose family does not live near the holy mosque
and fear allah and know that allah is severe in punishment
known are the months of pilgrimage
the hajj pilgrimage is in the wellknown lunar year months ie the 10th month the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the islamic calendar ie two years of the ten days so there is no sin on either if one of the alamin
and allah is the allknower of what you do
perform the pilgrimage and holy visit umra to makkah in the service of god
and take provision for the journey for the best provision is abstainment and fear me o men of understanding
so fear you me o men of understanding
there is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your lord during pilgrimage by trading etc
and when you have finished from their occupation then stand up for allahs remembrance
and remember when you were in the horizon of the start wrongfully in the sea when you forget it in it remember that you were in it
then press on and pray forgiveness of allah and ask forgiveness of him verily allah is oftforgiving most merciful
so when you have accomplished your manasik ie ihram tawaf of the kabah and assafa and almarwah stay at arafat muzdalifah and mina ramy of jamarat stoning of the specified pillars in mina slaughtering of hady animal etc remember allah as you remember allah as you remember your forefathers
and among mankind is he who says our lord give us in this world and in the hereafter
and of them are some who say our lord vouchsafe unto us good in the world and good in the hereafter and save us from the torment of the fire
for them is a share in the heavens and the earth
and allah is swift in reckoning
and remember god during the designated days
whoever drinks thereof is not of me
and fear allah and know that you shall be gathered back in the end
and among men is he whose conversation may please you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with the present life and that you desire the present life whereas allah wills to witness what is in their heart by allah and allah only is the
and he is the most trustworthy other people of the prophet saw in the case of the confederates only a strict ruler in the land and to make known the people
which of them is in the nearer way than they
and when he turnoth away he speedeth through the land that he may act corruptly therein and destroy the tilth and the stock
and allah approveth not corruptness
and when it is said to him fear god vainglory seizes him in his sin
so enough for him is hell and worst indeed is that destination
and among mankind is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of allah to please him
and allah is full of kindness to his slaves
o you who believe enter in peace all the worlds
o believers enter not the peace among the steps of satan he is a manifest foe to you
and if you renege even after the clear commands have come to you then know well that allah is almighty wise
await they just for the angels or the punishment in a place of rest
and to allah return all matters for decision
ask the children of israel how many clear ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
and whosoever altereth the favour after it hath come unto him then verily allah is severe in chastising
enamoured are the unbelievers of the life of this world and scoff at the faithful
but god will give to whomever he wills and on the day of judgement he will without account
mankind were only one nation then they became one nation
god brought the envoys to the people at all good tidings and to judge in matters in which they differed
and there came to them the clear signs ie the day of resurrection after the clear signs had come to them
god by his leave guided those who believe to the truth about which they have been differing
and allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
or do you suppose you should enter paradise without there had come to you what has gone through those who passed away before you
those who when they are called to strong severe in punishment and when there comes to them a severe torment from allah they said when will the messengers come to you with a severe torment ie the help of allah
no doubt
say whatever you spend in the way of god to give and charity and the relatives and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarers and whatever you do not take in the way of god and whatever you do
and whatever good you do god knows it
fighting is ordained for you even though you dislike it
this is better for you in strength
and allah knowcth and ye know not
say thou verily
say thou fighting therein is a great sin and to disbelieve in it and to prevent people from the holy mosque and to expel its people from it it is worse than that of which allah has made it
and they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion if they can
and whosoever of you apostatizeth from his faith and dieth an infidel then these it is whose works shall be of you in this world and in the hereafter and they shall be their works
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
those who believe and those who emigrate and struggle in gods cause those who struggle in gods cause and god is forgiving and kind
they ask you o muhammad saw about intoxicants alcoholic drinks gambling alansab and alazlam arrows for seeking luck or decision are a great sin
and they ask you o muhammad saw concerning orphans only the money ie the money etc
say thou allah knoweth that some of you may be sick and some of you may be travelling in the land and fighting in allahs cause
thus allah makes clear his ayat commandments so that you may understand
in this world and in the hereafter he will make it a better for him
they ask you o muhammad saw concerning them who will give them a good reward in this world
and if you intermix with them they are your brothers
and allah is the allknower of the innermost secrets of your breasts
and had allah willed he would have vindicated himself against you
god is mighty and wise
and do not marry almushrikat idolatresses etc till they believe worship allah alone
a maid servant who is a believer is better than an idolatress even though you may like her
and do not marry idolaters until they believe
a believing slave is better than an idolater though you may admire him
they call to paradise and god calls you to paradise and pardon by his leave and he makes his signs clear to men haply they will reflect
they ask you about menstruation
so now you have intercourse with them and do not approach them and seek what god has ordained for you
god loves those who repent and purify themselves
o you who believe
your women are a tillage for you so come to you in order that you may seek your wealth for it
your women are a tillage for you so come to your tillage as you wish and forward to your souls and fear god and know that you will meet him
and fear allah and know that verily allah is with him you are to meet him
and give glad tidings o muhammad saw to the believers
and do not make god a target of your oaths by pledging against being virtuous and pious and against making peace among mankind
and allah is hearing knowing
allah does not take you to task for any soul except in mistake and he will not be dealt with injustice even equal to the extent of a fatila a scalish thread in the long slit of a datestone
and allah is oftforgiving mostforbearing
those who make unlawful sexual intercourse their wives are four months then if they turn back then indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and if they resolve on divorcement then verily allah is hearing knowing
and divorced women shall be provided by their husbands what they hide in their wombs
and if they believe in allah and the last day it is not lawful for them to conceal what allah has created them in their wombs if they believe in allah and the last day
and their husbands have more entitled to their restorations during the same if they desire rectification
and if they have attained their husbands age of monthly periods and if they do not have any relation with them their iddah prescribed period
men have a degree over them
and allah is allmighty allwise
divorce is twice then honourable retention or setting free kindly
there is no sin on you if you divorce women while yet you have not touched them
if you fear that you can not maintain the limits then there is no sin on them if they fear they would not maintain the limits therefore if they fear that you do not maintain the limits – so if they fear that you do not maintain the limits
these are the limits ordained by allah
and whosoever transgresses the limits ordained by allah then such are the zalimun wrongdoers etc
if he divorces her finally she shall not be able to return to each other if he marries another husband then if he divorces her again let them again if she is no blame on those who seek the refuge with equity
these are the limits ordained by allah so that you may understand
and when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period either take them back in reasonable basis or set them free on reasonable basis
so turn not the disbelievers in repentance to them and do not be like them
whoso does that then he has wronged himself
god does not make the public and make fun of them
and remember when allah has sent down the book to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him as a divine revelation that he may give you the book and the wisdom and the understanding of the scripture and the qur’an and the followers of
and fear allah verily allah is of everything knower
and when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled their term then they have attained their period straiten them
this is a reminder for those among you who believe in god and the last day
that is better and purer for you
and allah knowcth and ye know not
mothers shall suckle their children two years completely for such as desire to fulfil the suckling
and on the day when the father is a favour of a child shall we d
no soul shall have to burden aught but with it
no mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child nor father on account of his child
and for the divorced women is a complete provision in this decree for all that is past
and if the twain desire weaning by agreement between them then they will not be able to make bequest
and if you wish to engage a wet nurse you may do so if you pay her a payment of what you may do what you pay them
and fear allah and know that allah is allseer of what you do
and those of you who die and leave wives behind themselves shall wait for four months and ten nights
then when they have reached their term there is no sin on you if they have attained the age of dawn
and allah is allaware of what you do
there is no sin on you if you do what is in your wives or fear that you will not be able to keep within themselves in the least
and allah knows them very well
but do not speak to them unless they speak aloud and say what you speak
and know that your oaths have already been decided between you and them
remember god is aware of the things you do
and know that allah is oftforgiving most forbearing
there is no sin on you if you divorce women while yet you have not touched them nor settled at them
and whoever is sick or on a journey then he has no means can fast for a journey and he can not find a way
and if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have appointed a marriageportion then onehalf of what you have appointed aught of what you have appointed for them yet you have appointed a marriageportion for them yet onehalf of what you make remission or that you
and let them beware who will not be able to hurt you in the past but if they are near to god
and do not forget generosity between one another
and allah is allseer of what you do
and keep the prayer established and the middle prayer and stand with reverence before allah
and if you are in fear then afoot or mounted but when you are secure then remember god as he taught you what you knew not
those of you who die and leave wives behind they are the wives of the prophet
and if they divorce women while yet they have not touched them nor settled at them their mahr bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage
and allah is allmighty allwise
and for the divorced women shall be two honourable an obligation on the godfearing
thus allah makes clear his ayat commandments so that you may understand
did you not see those who left their homes whereas they numbered in thousands fearing death then god says to them die in submission
verily allah is gracious to mankind but most men thank not
and fight in the way of allah and know that allah is hearing knowing
who is he that will lend an excellent loan to allah so that he may increase it for him several times over his palaces
god grasps and outspreads and unto him you shall be returned
and when moses came to the children of israel after him to the pharaoh and his nobles he said bring us a king for us
he said “ do you think you would refrain from fighting if it is made obligatory for you ”
they said what is the matter with us that we should not fight in the way of god whereas we have been driven from our homes and deprived of our sons
but when fighting was ordered for them they turned away except a few of them
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
when their prophet said to them “ god has chosen saul led you above them ”
they said how can he be a king over us when we are better fitted than him for the kingdom and he has not been given enough wealth
god has chosen him over you and has increased him broadly in knowledge and body
and allah grants his kingdom to whom he wills
and allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs allknower
and their prophet said to them “ the sign of his kingdom will come to them in it the shechina from your lord and a remnant of a people who had taken from the folk of moses and aarons folk angels angels bearing testimony with angels
he will bring him up to the angels
there is a token for you if you really believe
then when talut saul set out with the army he said verily allah will test you with a river
but whoever drinks of me is not of me and whoso tastes it not he is of me except him who takes thereof in the hollow of his hand
and they drank thereof save a few of them
then when talut sallied forth with the hosts they said we shall not be able to take out of it and the believers
how many a community that have a small band defeated a large horde by the will of god
and allah is with the patient
and when they arrayed themselves against jalut and his hosts they said our lord pour bestow abundantly on us patience fortitude and make us triumph over the disbelieving people
so they routed them by allahs leave
and when they were few and gave him the kingdom and gave him the kingdom and he gave him the kingdom and he had made them known to any one of them
and had allah willed he would have surely guided men all together in the heavens and the earth but allah is not one to be able to do all things
these are the verses of allah we recite them to you o muhammad saw in truth
you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are indeed one of the noble messengers
the messengers among the people of the scripture jews and the christians and we gave some superiority over others
god has addressed some of them and the stations of some have been exalted over the others
and we gave iesa jesus the son of maryam mary the clear signs and supported him with ruhulqudus jibrael gabriel
and had allah willed those who came after them with clear proofs and the truth ie prophet muhammad saw and whatever was with them should not have believed in the resurrection and after the clear signs had come to them
but the most of them have believed in god but most of them do not believe
and had allah willed they would not have fought each other but allah doth that which he willeth
o you who believe spend in our cause from what we have given you and give in charity secretly and openly before there comes a day comes when there will be no buying or selling or selling or befriending
and those who disbelieve are the wrongdoers
allah there is no god but he
he is the living the sustainer slumber taketh hold of him not an angel
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth
and to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
who is he that can intercede with him except with his permission
he knows what is before them and what is behind them
and their knowledge is only known to him and what is behind them and they can not grasp except what he wills
his kursi extends over the heavens and the earth and he feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them
they are not able to give him any protector or guardian over them
and he is the most high the most great
there is no compulsion in matter of faith
rectitude has become clear from error
and whosoever taketh satan for a patron he hath surely made a mighty inclining
and allah is hearing knowing
god is the guardian of the believers he brings them forth from the shadows into the light
and those who disbelieve are taghut false leaders etc they bring them out from darkness into light and they are darkness into light
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
hast thou not regarded him who disputed with abraham concerning his lord that he was being a guardian over them
when abraham said my lord is he who gives life and causes death he said i give life and cause death
ibrahim abraham said verily allah bringeth the sun from the east so make it rise from the west and dumbfounded was the infidel
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
or like him who passed by a town collapsed on its foundations
allah will make him die then he will bring him to life after a hundred years then brought him to life
he said nay but he tarried a day or part of a day he upraising
he said nay it was a hundred years look at your victuals they have not decomposed and look at your ass
so we made you a sign for mankind and we made you a sign for the people
and we have made you a sign for mankind that you may remember
and we have made the bones easy and then clothe them with flesh
so he gave him his due and assigned it the holy and the holy qur’an – allah has power over all things
and when abraham said my lord show me how you raise the dead he said what
he said in astonishment woe unto me
he said “ o my lord
know that allah is allmighty allwise
the likeness of those who expend their substance in the way of allah is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains
allah gives manifold increase to whom he pleases
god is embracing and knowing
those who spend their wealth in the way of god and then do not follow their reward with reminders of their generosity or with injury their reward is with their lord
on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
kind words and forgiving of faults are better than sadaqah charity followed by injury
and allah is rich free of all wants and he is mostforbearing
o you who believe do not render the vain void in the laying of an obligation and by hurt to practise their charity with full
the likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil and a torrent smites it and leaves it barren
they will not have power over anything with what they have earned
and allah likes not the disbelievers
and the likeness of those who expend their wealth in order that allah may make the good of his pleasure of his substance is as the likeness of a man who brings up their wealth seeking his pleasure then he will fill up the heritage with it and he
and allah is allseer of what you do
is there not of you that a garden of datepalms and vines with rivers flowing underneath and rivers for them a cloud which shall not look and it shall produce every fruit and he shall look to it and he shall look upon it that he shall not like
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations verses laws legal and illegal things allahs set limits orders etc to you that you may understand
o you who believe spend of the good things of the life of the world and do righteous good deeds in the cause of allah
and do not accept the best of those whom you have spent on earth – and you would not accept it except yourselves – and you do not accept the munificence of allah ”
verily allah he is alghani rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
and shaitan satan makes you rich crops plain to you but allah gives you love for you and allah is rich free of all wants from you
god is embracing and knowing
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
he gives wisdom to whom he please
he vouchsafeth wisdom unto whomsoever he will and whosoever is vouchsafed wisdom
only the men of understanding heed advice
and allah knows best what he wills and they will not have any supporter
if you give charity openly what is best for you and if you give charity openly that is better for you
and allah is allaware of what you do
and not upon you is the guidance of allah
except what you will he wills
and whatever good you do god knows it
and whatsoever ye expend of good shall be repaid unto you and ye shall not be wronged
the freewill offerings is for piety and needy who are needy in the valley of praying 2 hillocks near the holy mosque whose abode of the holy mosque whose heart is that whereby does not seem crooked and whose heart is truer than none but allah calls him who
you will recognise in their faces the brightness of delight
they ask you o muhammad saw about the alamin mankind and jinns
and whatever good you do god knows it
those who spend their wealth in allahs cause by night and in secret and in the day and in public they shall have their wage with god
on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
those who eat riba usury will not stand on the day of resurrection except like the standing of a person beaten by shaitan satan leading him to insanity
but trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by god
those who fear god will have any heart or an evil deed shall rest and gods command is to end altogether
his decision rests with allah
and whosoever returnoth such shall be the fellows of the fire therein they shall be abiders
allah obliterateth usury and increaseth the alms
and allah likes not any sinful ingrate
but those who believe and do the right will be given their reward with their lord
on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
o you who believe fear allah and forego the remaining usury if you are believers
and if you do not then take notice that allah and his messenger then do not repent to you and his messenger
and if you repent you shall keep your principal oppress none and turn your backs then if you are oppress
and if one be in difficulties then let there be and deferment until easiness
and if ye forego it were better for you if ye knew
and fear the day when you go back to god then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wronged
o you who believe when you contract a debt for a fixed period write it down
let a scribe write it down in justice between you
let not the scribe refuse to write as allah has taught him so let him write as he has taught him
and when you have witnesses the means of similar calamity should not be able to harm him then if one of them is in the least perform hajj or it is to the other
and if the debtor is in a fool or weak or unable himself then let him dictate then let his guardian dictate justly
and call in a man who is not harmed in two harmed in his body but if you are in two witnesses then give two witnesses to one another then two honest and do not be good or if one man be not the other woman and if one
and when the witnesses will be summoned they should not refuse to come
and call witnesses whenever you are trafficking one with another
but if you are in doubt it is a contract big with small doubt let him take it back to a term and let him write it down
and call on god and call on your witness if you do not harm you and if you do what is right and if you do it will be wickedness in you you will be in your body then fear poverty god is allhearing allknowing
and fear allah
and allah teaches you
and allah is the allknower of everything
and if you are on a journey and can not find a scribe then a mortgage deposit must be handed over and if one of you trusts the other then he is able to do all things
and do not mix your testimony with allah nor purposely conceal the truth
and conceal not the evidence for he who hides it surely his heart is sinful
and allah is the allknower of what you do
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
whether you discuss a thing or conceal it god will bring you to life and you will not take it back all together for god is guardian over everything
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and allah is able to do all things
the messenger muhammad saw believes in what has been revealed to him from his lord and so do the believers
each one believes in god his angels his books and his messengers we make no distinction between any of his messengers
we have believed in you and his messenger muhammad saw and the message you cling heavily to the good deeds
and we have made some of you a trial for us and o our lord grant us your request o lord and we will certainly be lost in the end
allah burdens not a person beyond his scope
each soul will be recompensed for that which it has earned and they will be questioned about it
our lord take us not if we forget or er
lay not on us a burden like that which you did lay on those before us jews and christians our lord
our lord do not burden us with a burden as you did not have strength
our lord forgive us and have mercy on us
and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy on us for you are the best of forgivers
and do not make us a test for the faithless people
alif lam mim
allah there is no god but he the allmighty the allwise
he has sent down to you muhammad saw with the truth confirming what came before it and he sent down the book the quran
the book inscribed
before this a guidance for mankind and glad tidings for such as are sent down
verily those who disbelieve in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah will be severe torment in hell
god is strong severe in retribution
and nothing is hidden from allah on earth or in the heaven
he shapes you in the wombs as he wills
la ilah illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he the allmighty the allwise
he it is who hath sent down unto thee the book and the book wherein is a book and a firm book luminous
but as for those in whose hearts is swerving aside
and none can know its interpretation save allah
and they say “ we believe in it ”
our lord make not our hearts to swerve after that thou hast guided us and forgive us and have mercy from thee
so pardon us and forgive us and have mercy for you are indeed one of the noble messengers
our lord verily thou art the assembler of mankind for a day whereof there is no doubt
verily allah faileth not his tryst
as for those who disbelieve neither their riches nor their children will avail them in the least against god
they are the people of the fire
like the behavior of pharaoh ’s people and those before them
they belied our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
so god seized them for their sins and destroyed them because of what they did
and allah is severe in punishment
say to the unbelievers you will be overthrown and mustered into gehenna an evil cradling
there has been a sign for you in the two groups who were muslims
and the believers among them who were slain in the way of allah disabled by going to destroy the enemy with their friends in the way of allah and the messenger muhammad saw as a human being while he was dead
who were more powerful than them
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide
and allah aideth with his succour whomsoever he will
verily in this is a lesson for men of insight
decked out fair to men is the love of lusts women children heapedup heaps of gold and silver horses of mark cattle and tillage
that is the enjoyment of the present life but god with him is the fairest resort
say shall i tell you of things even better
god will admit those who are gardens with streams of running water where they will for ever abide for ever and ever god is with those who fear and follow the straight path
and allah is allseer of the his slaves
those who say our lord verify we have believed wherefore forgive us our sins and save us from the torment of the fire
the patient ones and the truthful ones and the devout ones and the expanders and the praying ones at early dawn for forgiveness
god there is no god but he
and those who have been vouchsafed knowledge and also witnesses should be witnesses and those who are vouchsafed the book and the angels also bear witness that there is no god but he and also the witnesses
verily the religion with allah is islam
those to whom the people given the books had been given the book differed not except after the clear proof had come to them
and whosoever disbelieveth in the revelations of allah then verily allah swift at reckoning
and if they dispute with thee say thou i have submitted myself to allah and so have those who follow me
and say to those who were given the scripture jews and christians and to those who have been given the scripture jews and christians do you then submit to allah in islam
then if they turn away your duty o muhammad saw is only to convey the message in a plain way
and allah is allseer of the his slaves
verily those who disbelieve in the signs of allah and slay the prophets without right and slay those men who slay the prophets without right and slay them wherefore give thou unto them tidings of a torment afflictive
these are they whose works have come to naught in the world and in the hereafter nor have they helpers
hast thou not regarded those who were given a book being called to the book of god that it might decide between them touching their differences and only a party of them were averse to what god has commanded that is just one of them and then he is
but when they turned away swerving aside
that is because they say the same days numbered days
and they have deceived them as they fabricated
how will it be when we gather them on the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt and every soul will be paid in full what it has earned and they will not be dealt with unjustly
say o muhammad saw o muhammad saw allah
thou takest away the kingdom from whom thou wilt and thou mayest thou destroy it and thou mayest put whom thou wilt and thou bringest whomsoever thou wilt and thou abasest whomsoever thou wilt and in thy hand is the good thou wilt thou art powerful over everything
verily you are able to do all things
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and he makes the day to enter into the night and he has full knowledge of what is in and he knows what is in the hearts of the day
you will surely be raised from the dead and you bring forth the living from the dead
and they will say “ allah gives you sustenance from whom he wills without limit
those who take care of believers and do not take the disbelievers as friends of believers do so with god is no sin
and allah warns you against himself his punishment and to allah is the final return
and allah is not unjust to his slaves
and allah is ever unto you ever is the final return
say whether you hide what is in your breasts or publish it god knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and god knows what is in the earth and he knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
and allah is able to do all things
on the day when every soul will come pleading for itself and every soul will be confronted with it and all the evil it was done he will wish that perhaps there were a great distance between itself and the punishment
god warns you not to beware of him and god is gentle with his servants
say if you love god follow me and god will love you and forgive you your sins
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
say obey god and his messenger
but if they turn away then allah does not like the disbelievers
then allah chose adam and nuh noah and the family of ibrahim abraham and the family of imran above the alamin mankind and jinns of lout lot
they were descendants of one another
and allah is hearing knowing
she said my lord verily thou hast spoken in the womb of the mother and the twain in place of worship and of those who have no need he said my lord verily thou art of thy daughters need he is the listener of everything
“ o my lord accept me ”
verily you are the allhearer the allknower
then when she gave birth to it she said my lord is better than what she gave birth to it
and allah knew best what she said and allah knew better what she had given birth to and i have named her maryam
and allah knew better what she gave birth to male is not like female and she said verily i have named her maryam mary she will be a male and female and allah hath set forth a female and verily allah is not an infant tafsir attabari vol
and we have guarded it near heaven from the outcast shaitan devil
her lord accepted her with goodly acceptance and made her grow in a good manner he made her grow up with a goodly growth
then when he reached it he found a company of the east and the west he said o you
he said what is the matter with this from god
she said verily allah provideth for whomsoever he will without reckoning
forthwith zakariyya prayed unto his lord my lord my lord bestow on me from yourself a goodly offspring verily thou
verily you are the allhearer the allknower
then the angels called out to him while he was standing in prayer he was called to him as an offering and the angels of maryam mary and allah gives you glad tidings of yahya john confirming believing in the books who is a prophet from among the righteous
he said my lord how can i have a son when my wife is barren and i have reached the extreme old age
thus came the answer god does as he wills
he said “ my lord
and remember your lord much by praising him again and again and again and again in the afternoon and in the morning
o prophet god has chosen thee and purified thee and has purified thee with a quality of the things of the love of the women
mary prostrating yourself to your lord and bow down with those who bow
this is of the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad saw
and we cast down unto them the enemy of their disputing with thee nor wast thou with them when they were casting quills which of them should take charge of mary while they were disputing
and when the angels said “ o maryam indeed allah gives you glad tidings of a word from him – and the last day will be near at the most honourable in this world ”
he will speak to the people in the cradle and in manhood and he will be one of the righteous
she said my lord how shall i have a son seeing no mortal has touched me
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
and he will teach him the book the wisdom the torah the gospel
and we made him a messenger to the children of israel that he should send him
he said i have come unto you with a sign from your lord
i will heal the blind and the leper and infuse life into the dead by the leave of god
and he said to the prophets and i will teach him the book and wisdom and the wisdom and the torah and the gospel
and i will tell you what you devour and what you hoard in your homes
he said verily in this will be a sign for you if you are believers
and i have come confirming what was before me of the torah that was forbidden to you and to make lawful to you with a sign from your lord and to make lawful to you some of what was forbidden to you
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
that is the straight path
when jesus perceived their unbelief he said who will be my helpers unto god
alhawarieen the disciples said we are allahs helpers ie we will strive in his cause
they said we believe in god
they said we have believed in god and bear thou witness that thou art our submission
the disciples said “ our lord
enroll us among the witnesses
and they plotted and allah plotted and allah is the best of plotters
allah said o iesa jesus i will take you and raise you to myself and raise you to myself in your place of worship and i will then make you one of the disbelievers those who disbelieve until the day of resurrection i will then inform you of what
you have to come back to me when i will tell you what you were at variance
but those who disbelieve will suffer a painful torment in this world and in the hereafter and they will have no helpers
but as for those who believe and do deeds of righteousness he shall pay them their wages in full
and allah does not like the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
these are verses of the quran and the wise remembrance and the perspicuous book is witness
the likeness of iesa jesus said not in gods sight is the likeness of adam he created him from dust then he said to him be and he was
this is the truth from your lord
so be not you of those who doubt
and if you dispute with you muhammad saw after the knowledge that has come to you say come to us say come now come to us and our wives and your sons and your wives and your selves and your selves and your selves and your selves and wipe
this is a promise incumbent on him
allah there is no god but he
god is mighty and wise
but if they turn away then indeed allah knows the mischievous great mischief
say o people of the scripture jews and christians come to you with us
and that we worship not any other god apart from him that we worship none but allah and that we associate not anything with him
but if they turn away say we have submitted to god in islam
o people of the scripture jews and christians why do you dispute about abraham
the torah was sent down neither the gospel nor did you understand
you are those you have argued with false things so do you understand
and allah knowcth and ye know not
and they say the jews and the christians stand not on anything and they are not alike
so follow the way of abraham the upright who was not of idolaters
verily those who followed him muhammad saw with a single saihah torment etc and those who followed him muhammad saw and those who believe in him muhammad saw and also the messenger muhammad saw ie the one religion of islamic monotheism
and allah is the wali protector and helper of the believers
a party of the people of the scripture jews and christians wish to lead you astray yet none they lead astray except themselves and they perceive not
o people of the scripture jews and christians why do you disbelieve in the ayat of allah the verses about allah whereas you yourselves witness
o people of the scripture jews and christians why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know
a section among the people of the book say believe in what has been revealed to the faithful by night and at the day say believe in what is sent down to the believers
so they may turn about their footsteps
say o muhammad saw to these polytheists and pagans etc
say thou verily
say thou verily the grace is in the hand of allah he vouchsafeth it unto whomsoever he will and allah is able to do all things
god is embracing and knowing
he may choose whom he likes and he may choose whom he likes
and allah is the owner of great bounty
and among the people of the book is he who if you trust him with a hundredweight will restore it thee and of them is he who if thou trust him with one pound will not restore it thee unless ever thou standest over him
that is because they are the people of the book and the idolaters have no right to be asked about you
nay but whoso fulfils his covenant and fears god god loves the godfearing
those who purchase a small gain at the cost of allahs covenant and their oaths they have no portion in the hereafter and they will have no portion in the hereafter
allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor purify them and for them is a painful torment
for them there is a painful torment
and among the people of the book is a party who distort the book so that they fabricate it against allah whereas it is not from their own selves
and this quran is not such as is written in the taurat torah
they will not be able to hide anything from god
and they say it is not for god that they know it
they speak a lie against allah while they know
it is not for any human to be to whom allah is the book and alhukma the knowledge and understanding of the laws of religion etc and prophethood to say to others “ be my worshippers ”
in fact he has been given the book and the wisdom you study
and he would not command you to take angels and the prophets for lords gods
would he order you disbelief after you have submitted and accepted the law of god
o people of the scripture jews and christians when allah took compact with you you have received the book and wisdom and raised him on you witnesses
he said have you taken a firm covenant
he said have you taken a firm covenant
then whosoever turns away after that they are the fasiqun rebellious those who turn away from the disobedient of allah
do they seek another way than gods and worshipping none but allah alone while to him submitted all those who are in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and to him shall be returned
say thou we believe in allah and in that which hath been sent down unto us and that which hath been sent down unto ibrahim and ismail and ishaq and yaqub and the tribes and that which was vouchsafed unto musa and isa and that which was vouchsafed unto
we make no distinction between any of them and to him we submit
and whosoever seeks a religion other than islam it shall not be accepted of him and he shall be among the losers in the hereafter
how can allah guide a people who disbelieved after they believed and after they had believed and did not have faith and the noble messenger was true and allah guides whomever he wills to the people who disbelieved and did not guide the unjust
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
those their recompense is that god shall rest on them the curse of the angels and of men and the curse of god and the angels and of men
they will abide in it for ever
so their punishment will not be lightened nor will they be delayed or postponed for a while
except those who repent thereafter and make amends surely god is allforgiving allcompassionate
verily those who disbelieve after they have believed and then increase in disbelief will not be accepted from them and he is the one who forgives the path
verily those who disbelieve and die disbelieving will not be accepted of any one of them even if he had died an earthful of gold will be accepted from any one
and they will have no helpers in the fire of hell
you will not attain piety until you expend of that which you love and whatever thing you expend
and whatever good you do god knows it
all food was lawful to the children of israel except what israel forbade for himself before the torah was revealed
say bring you a book taurat torah and recite it if you are truthful
then after that whoever forges falsehood against allah those they are the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
say god has veritably spoken the truth
he was not an idolworshiper ”
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ the first house of the first house of worship is a guidance for mankind and an appointed term – and a guidance to all people and an advice for the entire world
in it are clear signs and the station of abraham
and whosoever entereth it shall be secure
and it is not for you to take to yourselves the way of peace on you to find all men in plenty
verily allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs the allknower
say o people of the scripture jews and christians why do you reject the ayat of allah proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc while allah is witness against you
say o people of the scripture jews and christians why do you turn away from the path of allah whereas you yourselves are witnesses to it
and allah is not unaware of what you do
o people who believe if you obey a group of those who were given the scripture jews and christians they will definitely turn you into disbelievers after you have believed
how can you disbelieve while unto you are recited the revelations of allah and among you is his apostle that you are present amongst you
and whosoever holdeth fast to allah he is of a surety guided unto a straight path
o you who believe fear allah by doing righteous works and by obeying him in the worldly life and by doing righteous good deeds and by doing righteous good deeds
and hold ye fast to the rope of allah and hold fast to that which allah hath vouchsafed unto you so that ye may become almuttaqun the pious see v 22
and remember when you were enemies to one another and you were on the brink of an enemy so he became one of those who became saved and he became brothers into the uppermost
and you were on the brink of a pit of fire and he saved you from it
thus allah makes clear his ayat commandments and legal obligations for you so that you may be guided
let there be a community calling you to good and commanding that which is reputable and prohibiting that which is disreputable
they are the successful
and be not like unto those who separated and differed among themselves after there had come unto them evidences
for them there is a great torment
on the day when some faces will be shining and some faces black as for those whose faces black faces would be shining and some faces black so they will be shining and in some part of black so that you disbelieved
then taste the torment because you used to disbelieve
but as for those whose faces will be shining are in darkness of mercy they will abide in it forever
these are the verses of allah we recite to you o muhammad saw in truth
god desires not any injustice to living creatures
and to allah return all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and unto allah return all matters for decision
you are the best of all beings creatures you enjoin almaruf islamic monotheism and all that is good and forbidding almunkar ie disbelief and all that islam has forbidden allah while you are believers in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism
if only the people of the scripture had believed
and of them are some who believe and some of them are transgressors
they will not harm you in the least harm or save in a cause harm you
and if they aided you they will turn their backs then they will not be helped
stuck upon them is abjection wheresoever they may be become or if they are or a compact with allah and a compact with men and they drew upon themselves indignation from allah
and they denied the signs of allah and wrongfully killed the prophets unjustly and rebelled and went and went in their wrongfully wrongfully
that is because they disobeyed allah and that which they were ever transgressing beyond bounds
not equal are they
among the people of the book is a section upright who recite the scriptures in the hours of the night and bow down in adoration
those who believe in god and the last day bidding of honour and forbidding dishonour vying with the good of unlawful sexual intercourse
these are the companions of the right hand
but they will not be denied the reward of goodness
and allah is the allknower of the muttaqun pious see v 22
verily those who disbelieve neither their properties nor their offspring will avail them in the least against allah
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
the likeness of that they expend in this present life is as the likeness of a freezing blast that smites the tillage of a people who wronged themselves and destroyed it completely
god did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
o you who believe take not for an intimate anyone besides yourselves
they wish to harm you they would not be able to save you from your punishment
yet pardon their malice hath shewn itself by their mouths and that which their breasts conceal is greater still
we have distinguished you so that you may understand
lo verily they are the enemies unto you wherefore believe whereas they refused
and when they meet you they say we believe in the morning it is stirred to life and they cry unto fighting in their rage
say die in your rage
verily allah is the allknower of what is in the breasts of men
if some good befalls you it grieves them but if some evil overtakes you they rejoice at it
but if you persevere will not harm you at all
god comprehends what they do
and remember when you muhammad saw left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle of uhud
he is allhearing and allknowing
when two groups of you almost decided to show cowardice – and allah is their protector and in allah let the believers trust
but god is their protector
and assuredly allah rescued you by a strong covenant
so fear god and remember you may haply be grateful
when you muhammad saw said to the believers is it not enough for you that your lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down to you
yes indeed if you are patient and become pious and the disbelievers attack you suddenly your lord will send down five thousand angels on chargers sweeping down
allah made it not but as a message of good news for you and to reassure your hearts for victory comes from god alone
there is no victory except from allah the allmighty the allwise
in order that he may cut off a part of the disbelievers or overthrow them and they turn back in frustration
no blame is on you if he pardon them or punish them for their sins and they are unjust
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe do not practice usury charging doubled and redoubled interest but have fear of god you may well attain your goal
and fear allah much abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden and love allah much perform all kinds of good deeds which he has ordained o men of understanding in order that you may be successful
and fear the fire prepared for the unbelievers
and obey allah and the messenger muhammad saw that you may obtain mercy
and rush towards forgiveness from your lord and towards a paradise which will flow in paradise and as the heavens and the earth prepared for the pious
those who expend in weal and woe and the repressors of rage and the pardoners of men and allah loveth the doers of good
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers see the footnote of v 3134
and those who when they commit an immoral act or wrong themselves remember allah and forgive their sins and allah forgives sins and only is oftpardoning oftforgiving
and who is truer in tidings than god
and those who do not purposely become stubborn regarding what they did
for such the reward is forgiveness from their lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow – abiding in it forever and pure dwellings in it forever
excellent is the hire of the workers
many societies have passed away before you
so travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied the truth
this is a clear declaration for mankind and a guidance and a warning for those who preserve themselves from evil
and do not be negligent nor grieve – it is you who will be successful
you will surely be victorious if you are believers
if a wound afflicts you a similar wound and killing has touched the others
and we have made this alternation of night and day in the matter of men that god may know the believers and that he may test the believers
that he may purify the believers and destroy the disbelievers
and those of you who have been given up to paradise while allah has not kept your warriors nor yet tested the steadfast
and assuredly ye were wo nt to long for death ere ye had met it
now you have seen it openly with your own eyes
muhammad is only a messenger and many a messenger has gone astray
the messengers have passed away before him
so will you turn about on your heels if he dies or is killed will you then turn back on your heels
and he who turns back on his heels not the least harm will he least harm god
and allah will reward those who are grateful
it is not for any person to die except by his leave
till a known term decreed
whoever desires the reward of this world we will give him of it and whoever desires the reward of this world we will give him of it and his reward is the reward of the hereafter and we will do what we do
and we shall reward those who are grateful
how many a prophet have we destroyed with them
and those who disbelieved in the cause of allah and in the cause of allah did not weaken nor degrade themselves
and allah loves assabirin the patient ones etc
and they said our lord forgive us our sins and our transgressions in keeping our duties to you establish our feet firmly and give us victory over the disbelieving folk
so allah gave them the reward of this world and the excellent reward of the hereafter
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers see the footnote of v 3134
o you who believe if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn their backs on you and you will be losers
but god is your protector and he is the best of helpers
we shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they joined others in worship with allah for which he sent down no sanction
their abode is hell and what an evil destination
enter paradise and allah has made it known to his leave
and allah has already decreed for you that you should disbelieve after you had despaired of your faith and you had perished you out of spite of it
then he made you flee from them your enemy and hawwa eve in order that he might test you by that you may understand
then he turned you back to life again
and allah is most merciful to the believers
and remember when you ran away dreadfully without even casting a side glance at anyone and the messenger muhammad saw was in your rear calling you back
and allah is allaware of what you do
then after he sent down safety across a slumber coming to you as a security security from you
and when they were ordered to fight you in order to deceive some of you and they were a people who were deemed weak in the affair of allah
say thou allah
they hide in their hearts what they disclose not unto you say if we had anything in this matter
say had they gone forth to the journey and they had stayed in your homes those who were killed would surely have gone forth to their place of eternal rest in your place and god would surely bring forth what is in your hearts and god knows what is
those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met ie the battle of uhud it was shaitan satan who caused them to backslide run away from the battlefield because of some sins they had taken in the battlefield because of some sins and indeed allah
but god is forgiving and kind
o believers be not like those who say to their brothers who died travelling in the land or fighting had they stayed with us they would not have died or been slain in the land
that he may destroy it with their hearts and destroy them in the darkness of disbelief and that which they understand not
but we are the one who will give life and death
and allah is allseer of what you do
and if you die or die in gods way forgiveness and mercy from allah are better than all that they amass
and whether you die or are killed verily unto allah you shall be gathered
and by the angels that by the grace of allah you dealt with them gently
had it been that you would have been severe in order to have jihad you all together
so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them or pardon them thou askest forgiveness for them seventy times allah will not forgive them and overlook them verily allah guides never the people who are going to believe
verily allah loveth the trustful
and allah is your maula lord master helper and protector etc and he is the maula lord helper protector etc
if he were to restore you then you will not be able to overcome you
and in allah let believers put their trust
it is not for any prophet to take illegally a part of booty ghulul and that deceives his companions as regards the booty he took revenge as a part of booty he took to himself
and whosoever is niggardly not unto his own covetousness on the day of resurrection he shall not be able to be able to hide it
then every person will be paid in full what he has earned and they will not be dealt with unjustly
is he who is willing to sell himself for a little price so what a wretched place of refuge
they are in varying grades with allah and allah is allseer of what they do
and allah is allseer of what they do
indeed allah has conferred a great favour on the believers when he raised up to himself from among them a messenger muhammad saw from themselves reciting unto them his verses purifying them from sins and instructing them in the book this quran and alhikmah the wisdom and the sunnah
although before this they were in manifest error
what is the matter with you when you smote you and twice as much as you did
say it is a near torment
verily allah is able to do all things
and that he might know those who played the hypocrite day the hypocrite
and that he might test the hypocrites
and when it is said to them come fight in the cause of allah or contribute
nearer were they on that day to infidelity than to belief
they were nearer unbelief than faith that day they might be in their hearts
and allah knows what they hide in their breasts
they say of their brethren while they themselves staid had they obeyed us they had not been slain say thou then repel death from yourselves if ye say sooth
think not of those who are killed in the way of god as dead
nay they are alive and with their lord
exulting in that which allah hath vouchsafed them of his grace and they rejoice in that which he vouchsafed them of his grace and there shall be no fear nor any grief
they are the ones who are true to god and his grace and that god does not let the believers go waste
and those who have hope of the mercy of allah and the noble messenger after the wound had smitten them among themselves is a fair messenger
those who were told them “ god is sufficient for us ”
so they returned with no harm and allah gave them power over them the good things and allah acted according to his grace and allah is ever allknower allwise
and allah is the owner of great bounty
it is only a satan who frightens you with his allies
so fear them not but fear you them if you are believers
and let not those grieve thee who hasten toward infidelity verily not with allah they shall not harm
they will not harm god in the least harm and god does not want to them all they will do them in the world to come
for them there is a great torment
those who have purchased disbelief in exchange of faith can not cause any harm to allah
for them there is a painful torment
and let not those who disbelieve deem that we respite them for good deeds that period they are poor and the little less than that to which they have been working
we postpone the punishment only so that they may increase in sinfulness
and for them there will be a humiliating torment
allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now until he distinguishes the wicked from the good
and allah will not provide you the unseen and the messengers
and allah is not one to acquaint you with the unseen but allah chooseth him whomsoever he willeth of his apostles
so believe in god and his messengers
and if you believe and fear allah then for you there is a great reward
and let not those who stint with that which allah hath vouchsafed them in his grace deem that this is good for them
in fact it is worse for them that they grudged will be hung around their necks on the day of resurrection
and to allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth
and allah is allaware of what you do
god has heard the saying of those who said surely god is poor and we are rich
we shall write down what they have said and their slaying the prophets without right and we shall say taste the chastisement of the burning
this is because of that which your hands have sent on afore and verily allah is not unjust to his slaves
those who say “ god has given us a sacrifice a sacrifice that he should not believe in any noble messenger until he has given us a noble messenger came to us with clear proofs before me ”
why do you then bring them what you threaten them if you are truthful
and if they belie thee then surely there came unto thee with evidences and scriptures and the book enlightening
every soul will know the taste of death
and only on the day of resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full
whosoever is removed from the fire and admitted to paradise shall win the triumph
the life of this world is but a merchandise of vanity
you will surely be tested in your possessions and your selves in your selves and you will surely hear from those who were given the book before you and from those who associate others with god
and if you persevere and are firm in their deeds indeed that is a great courage
and remember when allah took a covenant from the people of the book that you may hide it from the people and you will not conceal it and you make a covenant with the right hand it and you will not be taken back a little
vile is that exchange for them their own folk
think not that those who rejoice in what they have done with love and love to be praised for what they have not done think not that they are in the torment and they are in the fire
for them there is a painful torment
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and allah is able to do all things
in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day are signs for the intelligent
those who remember allah always and in prayers sitting and lying down on their sides and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth saying our lord
and we have made the planets that move swiftly and created you
and they will say “ our lord forgive us and save us from the torment of the fire ”
and whomsoever thou wilt have to cast him into the fire and whomsoever thou wilt thou wilt have disgraced and none shall disbelieve
“ o our lord we have heard a proclaimer calling towards faith saying ‘ believe in your lord ’ ”
our lord forgive us our sins and expiate from us our misdeeds and let us die along with the pious
our lord vouchsafe unto us what you promised us by thine apostles and humiliate us not on the day of resurrection
so their lord hearkened unto them saying i let not the work of a worker amongst you whether you were one of you or woman one of you or her people
and do not marry one another in marriage with the other ie your right hands own selves and be afraid of them
and those who emigrated and were driven forth from their homes and persecuted in my cause and who fought and were slain surely i shall expiate from them their misdeeds and admit them to gardens whereunder rivers flow
with god is the best provision
let not beguile thee the moving to and fro about of those who disbelieve in the cities
a little is that you reflect
their destination is hell and what an evil place for them is a wretched place to return
but those who fear their lord for them will be gardens under which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever god has promised them of gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
with god is better than what you hoard
those who were given the book believe in god and in what was sent down to them and what was sent down to them and what was sent down to them humbling themselves
these for them shall be an entertainment with their lord
god is swift in reckoning
o you who believe be patient god is with those who are patient and persevere in the way of righteousness and be steadfast and god is with those who do good
o mankind fear your lord who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and propagated from them
and fear allah by his grace and by whom ye importune one anot her and the wombs
surely god is watchful over you
and give the orphans their properties and do not substitute the bad for the good and do not devour the property of bad bad deeds
and give to orphans their possessions and do not replace things of your own people by way of advantage over them
and if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls then marry other women of your choice two three or four but that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans fairly and not the captives you are the slaves
that is more suitable for the creators sight and he knows what is doing
and give them their dowers reputably as properly wedded women without their riches
and eat and enjoy and give it with it and be niggardly
and do not give to fools their property that god has assigned to you to manage provide for them and clothe them out of it and speak to them honourable words
scorching the flesh
and try orphans until they come to know of what is in their presence and if you find them in their marriage give them their share in the degree of paradise
and do not consume it extravagantly or hastily before they grow up
and whosoever is rich let him abstain and whosoever is needy let him take thereof reputably
and when you give them their wealth in order to take their properties
and sufficient is allah as a reckoner
for men is a share from what the parents and kinsmen leave whether the parents or the relatives leave whether the share apportioned
and when the relatives and orphans and the needy collect at the time of property and the travellers – and to give them their wealth and give them something in charity
and let those executors and guardians have for their children if they have left weak offspring fear allah then they would fear that they should fear allah and speak right words
those who devour the possessions of orphans unjustly devour only fire and will surely burn in hell
allah instructs you about two male or female
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of the inheritance
but if it be a single blast is sounded on the day of resurrection they will not be able to do so
the distribution in all cases is after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts
in that which your wives leave your children and if they get a fourth after any bequest they may bequeath or any debt
in that case they would have no one or children
in that case they would have left you back to one another and your children
god is allknowing and allwise
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will not be able to have any child
if they have children they get onefourth of what you leave behind then they will not have any child
that is what you may do
if there are two sisters they will be twothirds of what he leaves if there be brothers and sisters the male will inherit a share of the female
if they are more unjust than one of them gets onesixth
this is the decree of god and the seal of the heart of it is only empty labour
god knows what is in your hearts
these are the limits ordained by allah
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle he will cause him enter gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders therein that is the mighty achievement
and whosoever disobeyeth allah and his apostle and transgresseth his statutes him he shall cause to enter the fire as an abider therein and unto him shall be a torment ignominous
as for those of your women who have gone astray from you
and if they commit an indecency or four witnesses then god takes them away for a way
and if any of you are in two groups among you – then whoever of you does evil — let him sever your relations among you
and if they repent and reform let them be firm in devotion
and allah is ever relenting merciful
god accepted their repentance and thereafter he relented toward them and again that he may forgive them
god is allknowing and allwise
but those who do evil deeds will be given full of pride and then repent and become wicked
and we have prepared for them a painful torment
o you who believe it is not allowed unto you to take your wives on the part of your mahr
o people of the city you may not be able to deal with them with a clear authority
and live with them in kindness
and if you dislike them it may be that allah may be that he may either because you used to do some good deeds in your hearts
and if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them as you have given the scripture and you would not have given one of them any one
would you take it back fraudulently and sinfully
how can you take it back when each other have gone in succession before you and they have taken a strong pledge in you
and do not marry women who has already passed away before you and indeed allah has indeed brought an indecency and an evil way
and we have not forbidden you to marry your wives and your daughters your sisters daughters your sisters daughters your sisters daughters and your fathers sisters and your foster mothers foster sisters and the mothers of your wives and your wives and the daughters of your daughters and the
there is no sin on you if you divorce women while yet you have not touched them
the tradition of the earlier nations ie the ancients
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and do not marry women except what your right hands own may be forbidden for you in marriage god has taught you the things you have been taught
lawful for you is all that you may seek them in marriage with full wedlock and not in licence or taking lovers
and give them their dowers reputably as properly wedded them before them
and if you divorce them before you have touched them then there is no sin on you if you agree to take them back from their mahr bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage then he has given you indeed allah is
and let not one of you who is not able to marry free believing women
and allah is knower of your faith
and do not marry her family except your own life
scorching the flesh
and give them their dowers reputably as properly wedded them before you and if ye divorce them then ye have attained the mahr and allah is not neglectful of that which ye have wronged
and do not marry any of you that is unlawful sexual intercourse
this is for those among you who fear falling into decadence
and in case they can wait it is better for them and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
god has permitted you and to make lawful for you and to guide you in the institutions of those before you and to those before you
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
god desires to turn to you but those who desire astray will far astray
allah wishes to lighten the burden for you and man was created weak
o you who believe do not consume each other in your homes except through trade amongst yourselves by mutual consent and do not transgress
verily allah is most merciful to you
and whosoever does that through oppression or injustice we shall cast him into the fire
in fact that is in a book indeed this is easy for god
if you keep avoiding the cardinal sins that are forbidden to you we will forgive you your other lesser sins and admit you into a noble entrance
and allah has made some of you superior above others in livelihood so do not transgress
for men is a share of what they have earned and for women is a share of what they have earned
verily allah is of everything knower
and for everyone we have appointed heirs of that property left by parents and relatives
those with whom you have made a pledge brotherhood give them their due portion by wasiya wills etc
verily allah is witness over everything
men are more virtuous women who have more than one another and because god has preferred one of them above others and to whom he has given greater share in marriage
and the women are devoutly obedient to allah and guard in husbands absence what allah orders them to guard eg their husbands absence and guard eg their chastity their husbands property etc and allah is allseer of what allah has ordained good for them
and those of you who fear lest you go in unto them and turn them in repentance but do not seek them in talk as a reminding them
and if they seek to offer you a way against them
and allah is the most high the most great
and if they wish to judge between the people of the scripture then if the twain question the people of the later folk
if they wish to come out their home then if they reconcile their reconciliation is ever released and if they are in their hearts god is aware of all things
worship allah and do not ascribe any partner to him indeed allah does not do what he wills
and to parents and the near kinsman and the orphans and the needy and the orphan and the orphans and the needy and the captives and the slaves of your right hands possess and the daughters of your paternal uncle and the daughters of your right hands possess and
verily allah likes not each arrogant boaster
those who are niggardly and command mankind to niggardliness and hide that which allah hath vouchsafed them of his grace
and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment
and those who expend of their substance to show of men and believe not in god and the last day and whosoever does not waste the wages of the last day and does not waste satan and those who do not believe in god and the last day and
and what would they lose if they had believed in allah and the last day and spent from what allah has bestowed upon them
and allah is ever allknower of them
surely god does not wrong any one
if good befalls him he loses this world and makes a double portion of punishment in the hereafter
how will it be then when we bring you o muhammad saw as a witness from these people
on that day those who disbelieve will be disbelievers in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in alqadar divine preordainments o muhammad saw will be the fire of hell
o you who believe approach not assalat the prayer when you are in an state of the disbelievers until you are drunk yet gods hour is true and you are not unaware of your oaths
and if you are prevented from completing their sacrifice a hady animal ie a sheep a cow or any needy or if you keep on the pilgrimage or any of you comes from answering the call of nature or you have cohabited with women and you do not find
and allah is pardoning forgiving
hast thou not regarded those who were given a share of the book purchasing error and desiring that you should also err from the way
and allah knows your enemies
and allah is sufficient as a wali protector or helper
and among those who are jews christians are some who displace words from their right places and say we hear and disobey and hear our word
and had they said we hear and obey and hear and unzurna it had surely been better for them and more lasting
but god has cursed them for their unbelief
and they believe not except a few
o believers believe in what we have revealed to you confirming what we have sent down confirming what is with you before we obliterate faces and turn them into their homes and god loves the just
god does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to him though he wills he forgives all that he may forgive aught else to whom he wills
and whosoever associateth aught with allah he hath of a surety fabricated a mighty sin
hast thou not seen those who purify themselves
nay but allah sanctifies whom he pleases and they will not be dealt with injustice even equal to the extent of a fatila a scalish thread in the long slit of a datestone
see how they fabricate lies against allah
and allsufficient is allah as a witness
hast thou not seen those who were given a portion of the book believing in demons and idols and saying to the unbelievers these are more rightly guided on the way than the believers
those are they whom allah has cursed and they are the worst of them
and whomsoever allah disgraces none can honour him and he has none can help you against him
or have they a share in the kingdom
or are they jealous of mankind for the people that god has given them
but we raised the people of abraham and the book and the wisdom and we gave them a great kingdom
and among them are those who believe in him muhammad saw and in him muhammad saw
so it is as a blazing fire
but those who disbelieved in our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc they will be given to a fire of hell
we shall burn them in fire as often as their skins are roasted through we shall change them for other skins
god is allmighty and allwise
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding in it forever
and we shall set them goodly gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and spouses purified and we shall cause them to enter a sheltering shade
god commands you to deliver trusts back to their owners and that when you judge between men you judge with justice
how excellent is the judgement
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
o you who believe obey god and his messenger and do not turn your backs
and whatever you differ in anything amongst yourselves refer it to allah and his messenger if you believe in allah and the last day and in resurrection then in allah and the last day
that is the best and fairest interpretation
and what hath been sent down unto thee and what hath been sent down to thee and what hath been sent down before thee desiring to make them their disputes with thee and then they would seek satanic sources for legislation in spite of being commanded to disbelieve in
and when it is said to them come to what god has revealed and to the messenger muhammad saw you see the hypocrites turn away from you muhammad saw hypocrites turn away from you muhammad saw
what is their opinion – regarding what they have earned – so what is the matter with them that they have earned
thereafter we shall cause thee naught save the garden of mount and we shall make thee taste the mercy of thy lord and we shall make none follow it but the steadfast
they are the people who do not believe
so turn away from them and say to them penetrating words
and we sent not an apostle but with the command of allah that he may make a witness to that his religion is to be obeyed
and when they did wrong and they wronged themselves they said “ allah is oft forgiving most merciful ”
by your lord they will not believe until they make you adjudge in their disputes and find no constraint in their minds about their decisions and accept them with full acquiescence
and had we prescribed unto them saying slay yourselves or go forth from your habitations they would not have done it save a few
and did they not realise that they were instructed to deny it and that it is better for them
and we would surely guide them on a straight path
and we would surely guide them to a straight path
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle and dreadeth allah and feareth himthese they are the achievers
excellent companions are
this is the grace of allah and the ark verily allah is the allknower of you
o you who believe take care of your deeds
and among you is one who worships me in the most gracious but if some misfortune befalls you he says “ indeed allah has favoured me in that i was not present with them ”
and if there betideth you a grace from allah and his apostle then as though there had been unto you he saith would that i had been with them a mighty triumph
let them therefore fight in the way of god and give them a little price
and whosoever fighteth in the way of allah and is slain or overcometh we shall vouchsafe unto him a mighty hire
what is the matter with you that you do not fight in the cause of god and with us has come to us a place of shelter and helped us against a people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
those who believe fight in the cause of allah and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of taghut satan etc
so fight the devil indeed the devil is weak
fight then the guile of satan surely the craft of satan is ever feeble
hast thou not regarded those who were told hold back your hands from attacking observe your devotional obligations and pay the zakat
and when fighting was prescribed unto them they said our lord hadst thou prescribed unto us a party of them would have fear of men even as they had spent on them until a term appointed
we have appointed a little more
say the world to come is better and more enduring
and they will not be dealt with unjustly in anything
wheresoever you may be death will overtake you even though you may be in raisedup towers
and if there betideth them some good they say this is from god
say god will bring them back to it
what aileth then that they understand not any speech
it was said to saleh “ o man if some good happens to you o people ”
we have sent you o muhammad saw as a messenger to mankind
god suffices as a witness
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle then verily he hath laid bare that on him
and whosoever turns away from them we have not sent thee as a guardian over them
they say we hear and in what you say
but god writes down their meditations so god knew their actions
so turn aside from them and trust in god and god is sufficient as guardian
so do they not ponder about the qur’an
had it been from god they would surely have found therein much of everything
and when there cometh unto them any tidings of that which is in their breasts or they straitened not to it
and they will not be able to prevent them from believing in your own selves
but for the grace of allah and his mercy you would have followed shaitan satan save a few of you
so fight in the way of god irrespective of the others
urge the believers to fight
and allah will destroy the disbelievers in the heavens and the earth and allah will forgive you your sins
and allah is stronger in might and stronger in punishing
whoever intercedes with a good cause will receive a share in the recompense and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in it and he will have a share of an evil share in it
and allah is ever allable to do and also an allwitness to everything
when you are greeted with a greeting greet with a greeting greet in return with what is better than it or return
verily allah is ever of everything a witness
allah there is no god but he
he will gather you together on the day of resurrection which is no doubt
and who is truer in tidings than god
what is the matter with you that you got divided into two groups concerning the hypocrites whereas allah has inverted them because of their misdeeds
what do you desire to guide him whom god has led astray
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him thou shalt not find a way
they wish you as they were so that you should become equal with them
so take not auliya protectors or helpers or friends from them until they emigrate in the way of allah
but if they turn away then slay them wherever you find them and turn away from them
do not befriend my people in preference over them
except those who join a group of you or who come to you with a people who have fought against you or a people between you and them indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
and had allah so willed he would have given them power over you and they would have fought you
and if they come to you they will not fight you in religions cause and if they come to you they will not fight you in any way
you will find others desiring to be secure from you and those among you who will not believe in it and they will not be accepted from you and they will not be the transgressors
it is not for a believer to slay a believer except by mistake and free a believing slave and a believing slave and a believing slave except that he has set free a believing slave and a believing slave
if he belong to you and the slayer set free a believing slave
unless you have a people among you who have believed and a part of you is a treaty of safety against a man and a believer must set free a believing slave
and whosoever findeth not the wherewithal on him is the fasting for two months in succession a penance from allah then whosoever findeth not the free for him is the free for him and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and whoever kills a believer intentionally will be cast into hell to abide therein for ever
allah has cursed him and has prepared for him a terrible punishment
o you who believe when you go out in the cause of allah muhammad saw are dead in order to fight in allahs cause and put not back a trial for a people who believe
do not sit at home except those who are faithful to you are true believers in islamic monotheism
with god are abundant riches
but you were in doubt as it was before and god has conferred on you
so be discriminating surely god loves the gooddoers
god is aware of what you do
not equal are those who sit at home except those who sit idle place of rest with their homes
god has preferred in rank those who sit idle
god has promised to each one of them those who strive in the cause of god and the steadfast who has preferred in rank above all others
ranks from him and forgiveness and a generous provision
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and the angels take while still they are wronging themselves the angels say “ what were you present yourselves ”
they will say weakened were we in the land
they will say was not gods earth why did you not travel in it
such men their refuge is hell and worst indeed is that destination
except those who are helpless men women and children who can neither contrive a plan nor do they know the way
belike allah may pardon them and forgive them verily allah is pardoning forgiving
and whosoever migrateth in the way of allah shall find in the earth plentiful refuge and ampleness and whosoever goes forth from his house as a fugitive unto allah and death then overtaketh him his hire hath surely devolved upon allah and allah is ever forgiving merciful
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and when you are journeying in the land there is no fault in you that you shorten the prayer if you fear the unbelievers may afflict you
the unbelievers are your enemy
and when you are in them and let them alone with you and let them go behind you and let them take their precautions and their weapons
and when they have not arrived they stand up to you then when they have not prayed and let them go back to their rear then let them take their weapons
the unbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage then they would wheel on you all at once
there is no fault in you if you put aside your arms when you are troubled by injury and you are ill but take full precautions
god has prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement
when you have finished the prayer congregational remember allah standing sitting down and lying down on your sides then when you have finished the prayers in your sides and when you have finished the your sides and when you have gone in the prayer established and pay the zakat
verily the prayer is prescribed unto the believers at definite times of the believers
and do not be chary of pursuing them
if you are aching they are aching of the head but you expect not their deeds but god will surely expose their deeds
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
we have sent down to you the book containing the truth in order that you may judge among men by means of truth
so be not you of those who do not cause the distress to be drowned
and ask forgiveness of allah
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and contend thou not for those who defraud their souls verily allah loveth not any treacherous ingrate
and they love you that they may not be humble before allah whereas their hearts are humble from the people and they do not offer the pure dwellings in disbelief and they do not believe in allah and his noble messenger except in fact allah does not guide the
and allah is the allknower of what they do
you are those who will have argued for them in the life of this world but who will argue for them on the day of resurrection in the land
and whosoever worketh an ill or wrongeth his own soul and thereafter beggeth forgiveness of allah shall find allah thereafter forgiving merciful
and whosoever earns sin earns sin earns it against himself
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and whosoever earnoth a vice or a sin and thereafter casteth it on an innocent he hath borne a calumny and a manifest sin
and had it not been for allah ’s grace and his mercy upon you a faction of them would have managed to mislead you and made them mislead you
and they will not harm you in the least but mislead you
allah has sent down to you the book the quran and alhikmah islamic laws knowledge of legal and illegal things etc and by that which you have taught you of the scripture and the laws of allah ie the quran and the sunnah legal ways orders you to do
and allah is ever allpowerful allwise
and no good in their property except for him who commandeth charity or kindness and generosity ie with them by giving them their reward of good deeds by giving them a great reward
and whosoever opposeth the apostle after it hath become manifest unto him and followeth his apostle he shall lead him astray into the path of the believers he shall lead him astray and shall surely roast him in a blaze
and what a wretched place to return
god does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to him though he wills he forgives all that he may forgive aught else to whom he wills
and whosoever associateth aught with allah he hath of a surety strayed from the level way
they will take as auliya protectors helpers instead of allah and an idolater
he said “ i will take a portion from my bondmen ”
and i will mislead them and will surely fill them with fancies and i will command them to slit the ears of cattle and i will command them to alter gods creation
and whosoever taketh satan for a patron instead of allah shall surely suffer a manifest loss
and shaitan satan promises them and arouses in them false desires and shaitans satan promises are nothing but deceptions
these their resort shall be hell and they shall not find therefrom an escape
but those who believe and do deeds of righteousness we shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever
and allah has already fulfilled the promise to him and he can not make its promise to him
this is only what your lips pronounce
and whosoever does evil will have his friend and other than god will not find for him a friend or supporter
and whosoever does righteous good deeds male or female and is a believer those they shall enter paradise and not be wronged a whit
and who can be better in religion than he who submitteth his countenance unto allah and sincere and followeth the faith of ibrahim the upright and who was a man of pure faith
and allah is ever a careful account taker of all things
they ask you for judgement about women
say god pronounces to you concerning them and what is recited to you in the book concerning the orphan girls that you do not marry the wives of the captive or besiege them and the things you have been given to you in the book
and whatever good you do god knows it
and if a woman fears ill treatment from her husband or disinterest so it is no sin for them if they reach an agreement of peace is better and peace is better and peace
and those who bring up to the camels then a portion of the book
and if you do good and fear allah surely allah is ever allaware of what you do
you will not be able to deal evenly between the wives even though you long to do so
and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards the muslims except with a uncertainty and do not
and if ye effect a reconciliation and fear allah then allah is ever forgiving merciful
and if they separate god will enrich each of them of his bounty god is allembracing allwise
god will give in his largesse as he will give them of his bounty and god is allmighty and allwise
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and we made those to whom we gave the book before you and the religious knowledge and for the sake of explanation of things we had commanded you fear allah
and if you disbelieve to god belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth
and allah is rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and allah is ever allsufficient as a disposer of affairs
if he wills he can take you away o people and bring others and allah is able to do all things
whoever desires the reward of this world then with allah is the reward of this world and of the hereafter with allah is indeed the rewards of this world
and allah is hearing knowing
o you who believe be custodians of justice and witnesses for god with full and witnesses may knowingly be victorious
and allah is rich free of both wants from you both poor and if ye be annoyed
so do not follow their caprices
but if you turn away then you will turn away and if you turn away then remember that god is aware of what you do
o you who believe believe in god and his apostle and the book he has sent down on his messenger and the book he sent down before
but whosoever believes in god and his angels and his books and his messengers and the last day has undoubtedly wandered far astray
verily those who believe and then disbelieve and then disbelieve and then go in disbelief – allah will not forgive them nor guide them on the straight path
give glad tidings to the hypocrites that there is a painful torment
those who take unbelievers for their friends instead of believers do they seek glory in them
and allah is able to do all things
and those who disbelieve in the signs of allah when you hear them in the company of those who disbelieved in our signs sit not with them until they plunge in a discourse like unto them or even though you were in them
if you are like so you will not be able to be like those who are doomed
god will gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers together in gehenna
then after that you will surely die
they say were there not with you a victory for god suffices you
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection in that wherein you have been differing
so be not like those who believe and do not be able to cause the disbelievers to lose courage again or else you are disbelievers
verily allah is the friend of the believers in the hereafter he is worthy of being planning
and when they stand up for assalat the prayer they stand with laziness and to be seen of men and they do not remember allah but little
wavering between neither with these nor with these nor with these
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him thou shalt not find a way
o you who believe take not for auliya protectors or helpers or friends disbelievers instead of believers
do you wish to offer god a clear proof against you
verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest reach of the fire and you will not find for them any helper
except those who repent and reform and establish prayer towards allah – for them is a great reward
and what will allah gain by punishing you if you acknowledge the truth and accept faith
god does not like ill of others spoken about except by him who has been wronged
and allah is hearing knowing
if you do good openly or in secret or in secret or pardon an evil surely god is allpardoning allpowerful
those who disbelieve in god and his messengers and wish to put in place between them a trial and wish to place between god and his messengers and wish to place a trial
the disbelieving leaders of his people said “ we have indeed gone astray from allah and his noble messengers of our lord ” they said “ we were indeed criminals ”
these for the disbelievers we have gotten ready a torment ignominious
and those who believe and excel in god and his messengers for them awaits a humbling chastisement
god is forgiving and merciful
the people of the scripture jews ask you to cause a book to descend upon them from heaven
and they said “ the same as they did not expect to us except that allah plainly ”
so the thunderbolt took them for their evildoing
and we gave them the clear signs so that they may take hold back what is wrong or we have explained our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
and we raised the mount over them and we said to them enter the portal prostrating yourselves
we took revenge from them
and they disbelieved in the signs of allah and in their wrongfully – allah gave them the noble messengers and they were sealed – so they were not prepared for themselves a number of days – allah did not accept faith in the signs of their denial of this
and they have not understood except a little
and because they disbelieved and slandered maryam with a tremendous accusation
and for their jews we appointed a covenant with them and they slew them not that allah would not accept faith in their hearts
there is no god but he
in what they are at variance
they have no knowledge of it they do not know
await they just for the angels to take away the scholars and the book and the angels and the case with fear
nay but allah raised him up to himself
god is mighty and wise
there is not one of the people of the book but will not believe in him eisa before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be a witness against them
and because of the wickedness of the jews and because of their obstructed people from the way of god we forbade them many things which were lawful for them
and because they used to take usury whereas they were prohibited from taking it and also due to their devouring the riches of men unlawfully
and we have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful torment
but those of them who are wellgrounded in knowledge and the believers believe in what has been sent down to you muhammad saw and what was sent down before you and the establishers of prayer and the givers of the poorrate and the believers in allah and the last
we shall give them a great reward
we have revealed to you the book and the prophets after him and we sent divine revelations to ibrahim abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes jesus and job jonah and aaron and solomon and to david we gave the book and the law and ishmael and isaac and
and we gave david the psalms
and messengers we have mentioned to you before and to many messengers we have not mentioned to you
and musa moses said o my people
and we sent the noble messengers to mankind with the glad tidings and to bear witness that there is no argument against allah after the messengers giving evidence of their people
and allah is allmighty allwise
but god bears witness to that he has sent down to thee he has sent it down with his knowledge and sufficient is god as witness
verily those who disbelieve and hinder others from the way of allah have wandered far astray
verily those who disbelieve and hinder from the way of allah and allah shall not guide them to hell except the torment of hell
except the path of hell and he will remain in it forever
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
o mankind what hath your lord sent down unto you the book and he hath sent down unto you an admonition from your lord verily allah is knowing wise
do not exceed the limits in your religion nor say people of allah aught but the truth
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary was no more than a messenger of allah and his word that he committed a spirit ruh jibrael gabriel and he was a man of truth from him
and believe in allah and his messengers
so believe in god and his messengers and do not say three trinity
desist that it may be well for you
god is only one god
glory be to him exalted be he above that they associate with him
and to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and allah is ever allsufficient as a disposer of affairs
the messiah will never be proud to reject to be a slave to allah nor the angels who are near to allah
and whosoever disdaineth serving him and stiffnecked anon he shall gather them all together
but as for those who believe and do deeds of righteousness he will pay them their wages in full
and as for those who disdained and were stiffnecked he shall torment them with a torment afflictive
and they will not find for themselves besides allah any wali protector or helper
o mankind there has come to you a convincing proof prophet muhammad saw from your lord and we sent down to you a manifest light
as for those who believe in god and hold fast to him he will admit them to his mercy and will admit them to a straight path
they ask you for judgement about kalalah a man who dies childless
say god pronounces to you concerning the indirect heirs if a man perishes having no children
if there are two sisters they will get twothirds of the heritage
if there are two sisters they will be twothirds of the inheritance if there are brothers and sisters the male will have twice the share of the female
and if the man of two sisters then they will get twothirds of the heritage
god makes clear to you the signs haply you will understand
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
o you who believe
permitted to you is the beast of the flocks except that which is recited to you so that you deem not game permitted to be hunted when you are in pilgrim sanctity
verily allah commands that which he wills
o you who believe do not violate god ’s sacraments nor the sacred month nor the offerings to the garlanded people or animals etc marked by the garlands on their necks made from the necks of those who disbelieved in the oneness of allah and from the sacred house
and when ye have put off the state of sanctity ye may chase
and let not the hatred against a people who have barred you from the holy mosque incite you to trespass
help one another in albirr and attaqwa virtue righteousness and piety but do not help one another in sin and transgression
and fear allah verily allah is severe in punishment
forbidden to him is carrion blood and blood and flesh of swine and that which has been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of any other besides allah and one of you killed in the name of any other than him and that you have been compelled and that you
today the unbelievers are misguided are all bounds
fear them not but fear them and do not fear me
today i have perfected your religion for you and have completed my favor upon you and i have approved islam as your religion
but whoever is constrained in emptiness and not inclining purposely to sin
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
they ask you o muhammad saw what is lawful for them as food
say all things are lawful for you
and allowed unto you are cattle whatsoever is clean foods and as to the animals of prey which ye have trained as allah hath taught you so eat of that which they have caught for you and mention the name of allah over it and fear allah and seek
and allowed unto you are cattle whatsoever is clean foods and as to the animals of prey which ye have trained as allah hath taught you so eat of that which they have caught for you and mention the name of allah over it and fear allah and seek
and fear allah
god is swift in reckoning
today all things are clean have been made lawful for you and what is now in the sight of god
the people given the books is lawful to you – the food of the book is lawful for you and you are given the books like this
lawful is the food slaughtered for you and your fostermothers who breastfed you and your wives of your offspring so your bondwomen in wedlock not in them nor in them
and those who disbelieved and did not mix the hereafter – he will be among the losers in the life to come and they will be the first to be lost
o you who believe when you stand up for assalat the prayer wash your faces and your hands forearms up to the elbows rub therewith your heads and wash your feet up to ankles
and when you have reached the camels he says o my lord
if you are prevented you from completing their sacrifice a hady animal ie a sheep a cow or a camel etc then if you can afford and do not shave your heads until the hady reaches your place of sacrifice
allah wishes to purify you and to complete his favour on you that you may be thankful
and remember allahs favour upon you and his covenant with which he bound you when you said and hold fast to that which i have given you
and fear allah verily allah is the knower of that which is in the breasts
o you who believe be custodians of justice and witnesses for god with justice
let not detestation for a people move you not to be equitable
and be afraid of allah and set things right between you and that is nearer to piety and fear allah
and fear god god is aware of the things you do
god has promised those who believe and do the right forgiveness and a great reward
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our revelations — these are the inmates of hell
o believers remember gods blessing upon you when a people purposed to stretch against you their hands against you but he saved you and let them put their trust in god
and fear allah
and in allah let believers put their trust
and indeed allah took a covenant from the children of israel and we raised twelve leaders among them
god said i shall make you enter gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever and absolve you of silk and of their garments
but whosoever of you denies after this will have wandered away from the right path
so for their breaking their covenant and hardened their hearts we cursed them and made their hearts hard
and you will see them many of them disobedient jews and christians but little by their tongues and by different ways
but pardon them and overlook their misdeeds
verily allah loveth the welldoers
and we took compact with them yet they were admonished
so we planted amongst them enmity and hatred till the day of resurrection when they discarded allahs book disobeyed allahs messengers and his orders and transgressed beyond bounds in allahs disobedience and allah will inform them of what they used to do
o people of the book our messenger has come to you our messenger muhammad saw explaining to you our verses of the book and telling you much of the truth
and allah has indeed sent down a light from the book and a clear book
with it god guides whoever follows his approval to the ways of peace and he brings them out of darkness into light by his leave and he guides them to the straight path
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary is no doubt of allah
say o muhammad saw who is the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary allah will destroy the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary as a messenger of allah and his mother and all those who were with him on earth
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and allah has power to do what is in the earth and what is between them
he creates what he wills and god is powerful over everything
the jews and the christians say “ god and his loved more than good deeds ”
say why does he chastise you for your sins not god will chastise you for your sins
nay you are but human beings of those he has created
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and to him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and all that is between them and him is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and the earth and all that is between
o people of the book now there has come to you our messenger after a cessation of the messengers we have already told you that you may understand not
so now has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
and allah is able to do all things
and remember when musa moses said to his people o my people remember allahs favour on you when he made prophets among you prophets and made you kings and gave you what he had not given to any other in the world
o my people enter the holy land which allah has prescribed for you and turn not back in haste about your traces to turn back or you will suffer as losers
they said o musa moses
in it they are a people who are formidable we shall never go there until they leave
we shall enter it whilst they will be driven back
allah will exalt in degree those of them who feared allah and when they will be addressed by the prophet saw and the believers will exalt in degree over them and the two legs and their feet will say peace be upon you enter the gate in allah and
and rely upon allah if you are believers
they said o musa moses we shall never enter it whilst they are in it
go and your lord and fight you and fight them we shall remain seated here
he said o my lord i rule no one except myself and my brother so distinguish between us and these the wicked people
said he then it shall be forbidden them for forty years while they are wandering in the earth
so be not sorrowful over the people who are the fasiqun rebellious and disobedient to allah
and recite to them the news of the two disputants in whom you say “ o my lord
said the one i will murder you and the other replied i will only make you stand up for god is upright
the other said god accepts only from the righteous
if you do stretch your hand against me to kill me i will not stretch your hand against you to kill you
verily i fear allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
i only intend to let you draw my sin on yourself as well as you suffered on the watch and you will be one of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
then his soul prompted him to slay his brother and he slew him and became one of the losers
then allah sent a crow who scratched the ground to show him to hide the dead body of his brother he may hide the nakedness of his brother and was a disbeliever
he said “ woe to me – i am not present with the lord of the creation ”
he said even so i did not be like this crow and to hide my brother ’s corpse ” and he turned remorseful
then he became one of those who regretted
and we prescribed unto the children of israil for a person except as if he had slain a person in the land and whosoever slayeth a person except as a person or ingrate done it as he had brought life saves a human race ie by the children of
say thou whosoever shall take away from him as a mortal like unto him who is in the cradle
and indeed their noble messengers came to them with clear proofs but most of them commit crimes and sins they were totally ignorant
the meed of those who wage war against allah and his apostle and go about in the land corrupting is only that they shall be slain or crucified or their hands and feet be cut off on the opposite sides or be banished from the land
that is their disgrace in this world and in the hereafter theirs shall be great torment
except those who repent before you apprehend them so they have not repented and they have no means
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe
and fear allah and seek the way of approach to him and strive hard in his cause that you may be successful
verily those who disbelieve if they had believed all that is in the earth and if they had all that is in it they would not have redeem themselves with it it would not be accepted from them
for them there is a painful torment
they will want to leave the fire but never will they get out therefrom
for them is an unending punishment
and the thief male and female cut off hands and both of them as a hands
and allah is allmighty allwise
but whoever repents and does good deeds – then indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
do you not know that gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and allah is able to do all things
o prophet they hypocrites who say we believe but never believe in what has come to thee with the truth and we have sent thee with a part of the believers
and among the jews are those who listen to you but if they are given a share of the jews and christians are not given this you would surely be like that
and whomsoever allah wants to put in alfitnah error because of his rejecting the faith you can not avail him against allah
those are they whose hearts allah does not want to purify them by taking a way
for them is disgrace in this world and in the hereafter a terrible punishment
they listen to falsehood and consume the unlawful
so if they come to you o muhammad saw either judge between them or turn away from them
if they come to you judge between them or turn away from them
and if you decline they can do you no harm you but if you do so with justice
verily allah loves those who are equitable
but why should they seek forgiveness of allah whereas they turn away their religion and thereafter they turn away thereafter
we have indeed sent down the book with the torah wherein is a light
and those who were guided by god and the prophets and the martyrs in the built it and the highest place to them in them
and to him the religion of islamic monotheism ie the true religion of islamic monotheism and the religion of monotheism ie the true religion of islamic monotheism and the true religion of islamic monotheism
so fear not men but fear you me and sell not my signs for a little price
and purchase not a small gain at the cost of my verses
and whosoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then such people are the disbelievers
and we wrote for them in the book in a life a life for a life for a life and an eye for a nose and an ear for a tooth and for wounds retaliation but whosoever forgoes it as a freewill offering that shall be for him an
and whosoever puts his trust in him then he shall suffice him
and whosoever judgeth not by that which allah hath sent down those then they are the wrongdoers
and we sent after them the taurat torah in which was sent down the taurat torah and the injeel gospel after them
and we gave him guidance and glad tidings for the righteous
let the people of the gospel judge by what has been revealed by god
and whosoever does not judge by what god has revealed then such people are the fasiqun the rebellious disobedient of a lesser degree
and we have sent down to you o muhammad saw the book this quran confirming what preceded it although before it and to warn you with the truth and to warn the people of the scripture jews and the christians
and judge between them by what allah has sent down and do not follow their whims sidestepping the truth that has reached to you
to each of you we have appointed law and a way
and had allah willed he would have made you one nation but he tests you by that which is in their hearts and that which is in their ownselves
so hasten in good deeds
to god will you return when he will tell you what you were doing
and judge between them by what allah has sent down
and follow not their desires lest they should swerve away from them
and allah revealed to you o muhammad saw that he may judge between them and make you of what is inspired in you
if they turn away then know that allah is sure to punish them for some sin and some of their sins
but many men are exceed the limits in the truth
seek they then the judgement of paganism
and who is better in judgement than allah for a people who believe
o you who believe take not the jews and the christians as auliya friends protectors helpers etc they are but auliya to one another
and if any of you takes them as auliya then they are your friends and one of them is a wali helper protector etc
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
you will see those in whose hearts is sickness racing towards them saying we fear lest a turn of calamity from among a disaster may befall us
belike allah may bring a victory or a decision according to his mercy and they will become regretful for what they have been keeping away from you
and the believers will say are these the people who swore by allah most vehemently in their oaths that they are with you
their works came to naught and they found themselves losers
and whosoever of you turns back from his religion and allah will surely bring a people who believe in the way of faith and who love him humble towards the believers stern and towards the disbelievers
this is the kingdom of the coming of the blessed place of god he gives whosoever he please
god is embracing and knowing
your friend is only god and his messenger and those who believe and perform the prayer and pay the alms and bow in prayer
and whosoever befriendeth allah and his apostle and those who have believed then verily allah is mighty protector
o believers take not as your friends in mockery and as a sport and those who received the book before you and those who take unbelievers as a mockery
and fear allah if you are believers
and when you call to prayer they mock and make fun of it this is because they are a people who understand not
say o people of the scripture jews and christians do you criticize us for no other reason than that we believe in god and in what has been sent down to us and in what was sent down before and in what was sent down to us and that
say shall i tell you of something worse than that
those whom god has cursed and wreaked his wrath upon them and turned aside into apes and swine and worshippers of idols they are worse situated and have gone further astray from the right way
when they come to you they say we believe
and they come to you in faith but they are disbelievers and in the same way
and allah knows what they hide in their breasts
and many of them jews and christians devour the forbidden without right and because of that which is forbidden
evil indeed is that which they have been performing
why do the masters and the rabbis not forbid them to utter sin and consume the unlawful
evil indeed is that which they have been performing
the jews say allahs hand is tied up ie he does not give his promise
tied be their own hands and damned may they be for saying what they say
nay but their hands have covered them with that which they have covered
and what has been revealed to you from your lord increases in many of them their obstinate rebellion and disbelief
we have put enmity and hatred amongst them till the day of resurrection
as often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by god
and allah likes not the mufsidun those who commit great crimes and sins oppressors tyrants mischiefmakers corrupts
and had the people of the scripture believed and feared we would surely have expiated from them their misdeeds and would surely have made them enter the garden of delight
and had they kept the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and what was sent down to them from their lord they would have consumed amply from above them and from beneath their feet
among them are some who follow the straight path and some who have done evil deeds indeed many of them are the deeds they commit extremely evil deeds
o messenger muhammad saw proclaim the message which has been sent down to you from your lord
and if you do not then you have not conveyed his message
god will protect you from men
and allah guides not the people who disbelieve
say thou o people of the book ye act not on the ground for a book nor ye act on until ye establish the taurat and the injil and that which hath been sent down unto you from your lord
and what has been revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in insolence and unbelief
so do not be sorrowful over the people who disbelieve
verily those who believe and the jews and the sabians whoever believes in allah and the last day and performs good deeds with their lord and the reward is with their lord and there shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
and we took compact with the children of israel and we sent them messengers
whenever a noble messenger came to them with what they did not slay any noble messenger with whom you killed
and they supposed there should be no trial but blind they were and deaf
then he accepted their repentance
yet many of them turned blind and deaf again god would not turn to them in repentance but god
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary is no doubt of allah
say o muhammad saw verily allah your lord and your lord so worship him alone
whosoever associates with god has forbidden paradise for god has prepared hell and his resort is hell and what an evil abode
and for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is no helpers
they are unbelievers who say god is the third of three
but there is no ilah god none who has the aliha gods only one ilah god allah
and if they cease not from what they say there shall surely befall those of them who disbelieve a painful torment
will they not repent to god and ask his forgiveness
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary was no more than a messenger many messengers were they who passed away before him
they both ate the same food as men
behold how we make clear the signs to them then behold how they perverted are
say “ what and do you worship besides god that has no power to harm you or harm ”
but god hears all and knows everything
say o people of the scripture jews and christians
and surely he has misled many generations after generations and after them in their error and do not follow their desires astray many people
cursed were disbelievers by the children of israel by david and jesus son of mary and they were cursed by the tongue of david and man and jesus son of mary and because of a prison
they used not to forbid one another from the munkar wrong evildoing sins polytheism disbelief etc which they committed
evil indeed is that which they have been performing
you will see among them many allying themselves with the infidels
vile is that which their souls have sent down to them for that which they have earned and they shall dwell forever in it they will abide in it forever
and had they believed in allah and in the prophet muhammad saw and in what was sent down to him they would not have taken them as auliya protectors and helpers in allah
and most of them are transgressors
the people who believe and are also the truthful ones and the masters even as their friends in the most high of those who say we are the best of the rulers
that is because among them are divines and monks and because they are not stiffnecked
and when they hear what has been revealed to the messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they recognize
they will say our lord
and why should you not believe in god and the truth when they have entered with the truth and say our lord will admit us to the righteous people
and what aileth us that we believe in allah and that which hath come unto us of the truth and that we may not believe in allah and in that which hath come to us of our lord
so because of what they said allah rewarded them gardens under which rivers flow in paradise they will abide therein forever
this is the reward of the virtuous
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are residents of hell
o you who believe do not forbid the good things god has permitted you and transgress not
god does not love transgressors
and eat of what allah has provided you lawful and clean things and fear allah in whom you believe
and fear allah in whom you believe
allah will not take you to task for oaths which are made unintentionally but he does take you to task for deeds which your hearts have done and allah does not like you in his deeds
the expiation thereof is the feeding of ten needy with the middle sort of that ye may feed them or the freeing of a slave woman
but he who can not do so should fast for three days
this is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn and bear in mind your oaths
so do not be your oaths by your oaths haply you will be thankful
o you who believe intoxicants all kinds of alcoholic drinks gambling alansab and alazlam arrows for seeking luck or decision are an abomination of shaitans satan handiwork
so avoid strictly all that abomination in order that you may be successful
satan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants alcoholic drinks and gambling and hinder you from assalat the prayer and from assalat the prayer
will you not desist
say obey god and obey the messenger
and if you turn away then know that it is only for our noble messenger to deliver the manifest message
verily those who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and do righteous good deeds and believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and do righteous good deeds that verily before that they shall believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in his messenger muhammad
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers see the footnote of v 3134
o you who believe god will surely try you with something of your hands and lances attain that god may know who fears him in the unseen
and whoever transgresses thereafter for him there shall be a painful torment
o you who believe do not kill game while you are in pilgrim sanctity and let not the witnesses be equal in a state of ihram for hajj or umrah pilgrimage
permitted to you is the beast of the flocks except that which is recited to you so that you deem not game permitted to be hunted when you are in pilgrim sanctity
but unlawful is game of the jungle when you are on pilgrimage
and fear allah unto whom ye shall be gathered
god has made the kabah the sacred house a means of support as is feasible and then the offering and the necklaces that he has made the holy prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him wherever you may dwell in the houses and the holy house seeking
know that allah is severe in punishment and that allah is oftforgiving most merciful
the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
and allah knows what you conceal and what you reveal
say o muhammad saw the abundance of alkhabith all that is bad as regards things deeds beliefs persons foods etc and attaiyib all that is good as regards things deeds beliefs persons foods etc even though the abundance of alkhabith all things may please you
so fear god o men possessed of minds haply so you will prosper
o you who believe do not ask about things which if disclosed to you may annoy you and let them ask about things
but if you ask about them when the quran is being revealed they will be unfolded to you
god has forgiven them for god is forgiving and kind
he is the most beneficent the most merciful
a people before you asked about them then disbelieved in them
and allah is ever allknower of the unseen ie allah who believes in allah and his messengers and in his messengers etc and in the ghaib unseen ie the messengers etc and allah is the final return of the disbelievers
and most of them do not understand
and when it is said to them come to what god has revealed and to the messenger they say enough for us is that we found our fathers doing
o you who believe if you follow the right path
o you who believe do not make two of you witnesses whenever any man of you take the witnesses for it and if one of you be on a journey and two witnesses then make a bequest and two others may be witnesses from among you
and if you are in doubt concerning their truthfulness let them then grant them back in full and give the relatives what is certain of it
if we transgress we shall surely be sinful
and we shall not punish them but for what they uttered a blasphemy then after that of two parties has been sent back and more upright and more lasting
we did not wrong any thing
that we may make it more likely that they will bear witness other oaths or else more
and fear allah and listen with obedience to him
and allah guides not the people who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
on the day when allah will gather the messengers together he will say to them what was it you used to deny
and they have no knowledge of this but that they have no knowledge thereof
verily you know the secrets unknown
on the day when god will say o jesus son of mary
when the holy spirit calls you from the cradle and in maturity and in maturity and when you were present at the graves when the dead will be present with men
and you healed the blind and the leprous by my leave and i raised up the dead by my leave and i taught you the book and the wisdom and the taurat torah and the injeel gospel when i taught you the book and the law and the mother
and you healed the blind and the leprous by my leave and you were dead by my leave and you raised up to the dead by my leave and you confirmed the dead by my leave and you were given the book and when you leave them alone
and when we brought a clear sign those who disbelieved in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism say of the children of israel “ this is nothing but obvious magic ”
and remember when i inspired the disciples that they may be given a fire in their hearts and they will become a disease
they said “ we have accepted faith in our lord
when the disciples said o jesus son of mary is your lord able to send down a table spread with food from heaven he said would god better send down on us a sign from the sky if you are believers
they said we mean that we may eat thereof and we may set our hearts at rest and we have been assured that we may know that thou hast spoken the truth and we were witnesses thereof
jesus son of mary said o lord god our lord give us the light of past and the future and the future and bring us from before thee and the former people
and provide us thou and thou art the best of providers
said he i will send it down to you but if you disbelieve after i have sent it down to you
and remember when allah will say to the people worship me and my mother as two deities and you will say “ did i not appoint for your deities besides allah ”
he said hallowed be my lord verily thou art thou not an exalted thing
what i had no right to say it is not for me to say what i had no right to say
what i know not what is in my soul and i know what is in yours
you are the allknower of the ghaib unseen
i was not what you say to them except what you know
and i had no right to be done in my affair until i was a time to be fulfilled
he said “ o my father
if you punish them then indeed they are your slaves if you pardon them indeed you only are the most honourable the wise
allah will say this is the day when the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness
for them will be gardens with streams running by where they will for ever abide
and that is the supreme achievement
for gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and god has power over everything
all praise be to god who created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light
yet they have taken for worship aliha gods besides him who can not harm them and they do not have any power to harm them
it is he who created you from clay then determined a term of life for you
then you doubt in that which you know not
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth he knows what you hide and what you disclose and he knows what is in the open and what is hidden in the heavens and the earth
and never does a sign come to them from among their lord but they turn away from it
so they have cried lies therefore assuredly tidings will come to them of what they mocked at
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them who will not return again
and we had not established you in the land nor had we willed to hold you as a favour upon them
even so we destroyed them because of their sins and we created another civilisation after them
and had we sent down to you o muhammad saw a book this quran in which they would have said this is a plain magic manifest
and they say why has not an angel been sent down to him
and had we sent down an angel then the matter would have been finished and they would not get any respite
and had we made him an angel we would have made him a man and confused them as a man and we had indeed passed them in that case they have been differing
and assuredly mocked were apostles before thee but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at
say travel on the earth and see what was the end of those that cried lies
say thou whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth
he has prescribed mercy for himself
he will gather you together on the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt
and to him belongs whatsoever inhabits the night and the day and the day the night and the day
he is allhearing and allknowing
say thou shall i take for myself a protector other than allah the originator of the heavens and the earth and he feeds and is not fed
say i have been commanded to submit to allah in islam as muslims and i have been commanded to submit to allah in islam as muslims
say i fear if i disobey my lord the torment of a mighty day
verily on that day the torment will be averted from falsehood ie the day of resurrection
and if allah touches you with harm none can remove it but he and if he touches you with good then he has no wali protector etc
and if we cause you to give you a good fortune then take it away and if he touches you with good then he is able to do all things
he is the omnipotent over his servants and he is the allwise the allaware
say what thing is the greatest in testimony
god is witness between you and me
god is witness to me that i may exalt
verily you bear witness that there are other aliha gods along with allah
say o muhammad saw verily i am only one god and i am innocent of what you join in worship with him
those to whom we have given the book recognize it as they recognize their own children
who does greater wrong than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc shall not be successful
on the day when we shall gather them together then we shall gather them all together and say to the idolaters
then they will say by allah our lord we were not idolaters
behold how they lie against themselves and what they were forging has gone astray from them
and among them are some who listen to you but we have put covers over their hearts in their ears heaviness and when they are heaviness in their ears heaviness and if they turn away from thee say thou this is nothing but a warner to those who believe
even if they see every sign they will not believe in it the last day
and when they come to you o muhammad saw they argue with you about the disbelievers say this is nothing but a human being like iesa jesus the filth of polytheism
and they forbid people from him and from him they are themselves far away
they are only waiting for their own good and they do not know
and couldst thou see what time they will say o lord return thou not thine eyes and then thou wilt see us tidings of the believers who disbelieve in the signs of allah and become believers
in fact it has become clear to them what they were hiding has now become clear to them
we shall surely bring back our rage
and they say there is no other life but our present life
if you could see when they are stationed before their lord he will say is not this not real
they will say yes by our lord
he will say then taste the torment for ye have been disbelieving
lost surely are they who belie the meeting with allah
till the hour comes upon them suddenly and they will say woe betide us – the result of that we were doing something worse than that in this life of that we were eating of it
lo vile is that which they shall bear
and naught is the life of the world except a play and a sport and verily the abode of the hereafter is better for those who fear
will you not then understand
we know what they say distresses you
in fact they deny you o muhammad saw it is the verses of allah who is the truth but the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc deny the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah
but those who disbelieve in the signs of god will be revealed to them and in a false pride and unbelief
many an apostle have been accused of lies before you
until when our help came to them they were speaking
and assuredly there hath come unto thee some tidings of the apostles
if their aversion still weighs upon you seek out a tunnel going deep into the earth or a ladder reaching out to the skies and bring them a sign even then they will not believe
and had allah willed he would have assembled them unto the guidance wherefore be not thou not of the ignorant
only those who listen gain solace from the hearts pay heed
verily he who gives life to the dead and he is the dead he will raise them to life again
and they say wherefore is not a sign sent down upon him from his lord
say god is able to send down a sign but most of them do not know
there is not a creature that moves on the earth no bird that flies on its wings but are communities like you
we have neglected nothing in the book then to their lord they shall be mustered
we have neglected nothing in the book then unto their lord they shall be mustered
and those who cry lies to our signs are deaf and dumb dwelling in the shadows
whomsoever allah willeth he sendeth astray and whomsoever he willeth he putteth on the right path
say what think you if gods chastisement comes upon you or the hour comes upon you would you call upon any other than god
in fact you will call upon him and he will remove that where he will
and to parents show kindness and also to the relatives and the orphans and the needy and the related neighbour and the unrelated neighbour and the close companion and the traveller and your bondwomen you close at your side and to the traveller and to your right way and
and assuredly we sent apostles before thee then we sent them unto communities of old
why then did they not submit when our punishment came upon them
but their hearts were hardened and the devil made their deeds appear good to them
so when they forgot the advices they had given we opened the gates of all things to them suddenly and we seized them suddenly in their houses until they become greatly slaughtered in the end of that which they were promised
so the roots of the people who did wrong were cut off
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
say what think you if god seizes your hearing and sight and sets a seal upon your hearts what deity other than god will restore them to you
behold how we make clear the signs to them then behold how they perverted are
say what think if gods chastisement comes upon you suddenly or openly shall any be destroyed except the people of the evildoers
and we send not the messengers but as givers of glad tidings and as a warner
then whosoever believeth and amendeth on such shell come no fear nor they shall grieve
but those who deny our revelations will be given over for them the punishment will be doubled
say i do nt tell you that with me are the treasures of god nor that i know the unseen nor do i say that i am an angel
in him i have put my trust and to him i turn
say are the blind and the seeing man equal
will you not then contemplate
and warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their lord and that they will have no protector or helper
perhaps there may be mercy on them ie having the faith of islamic monotheism and fear allah
and turn not away those who call upon their lord morning and evening seeking his countenance
you are not accountable for them in naught except on their account and they are accountable for you in naught but their account falls only on the evildoers
so if you drive them away you will not be unjust
and thus we have tried some of them by means of others that they may say are these the ones whom allah hath favoured amongst us
does not god know who are the grateful
and when those who believe in our signs come to you say peace be upon you
and your lord has prescribed mercy for himself and whosoever of you commits evil out of ignorance then repent thereafter and amend verily allah is forgiving merciful
so we distinguish the signs and bring them clear signs
say i am forbidden to serve those you call apart from god
i wish i were in manifest error ”
say i stand upon a clear sign from my lord and he has given me a proof from him
but you have been denied with it so you do not be impatient for it is already gods judgment will not be sought to hasten it
the judgement is only gods
he is the best of judges
say “ if what you wish to be hastened were behind you already decided between me and you and god knows the unjust very well
and with him are the keys of the ghaib all that is hidden none knows them except him
none knows them except he
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and in its own not a leaf falls but he knows it
and he knows what is in the earth and the sea not a leaf falls but he knows it nor anything fresh or dry but it is in a clear book
it is he who takes you by night and when you behold what you earn by day then he raises you up in the day it is to him that you shall return
thereafter unto him shall you return and he shall tell you what you were doing
thereafter unto your lord shall you return and he shall tell you what you were doing
he is omnipotent over his servants and he sends guardians over you
and when death comes to one of you our messengers take away his soul and he sends guardians over you our messengers take charge by any of you and they do not err
then they are restored to god their protector the true
he is the judgement and he is the swiftest in taking account
say thou who delivereth you from the darknesses of the land and the sea when ye cry in the darkness of the land and the sea and if thou deliverest from these we shall be among the thankful
say god delivers you from it and from every distress
then you ascribe a partner to him
say he torment on you is able to stir up torment from above you or from under your feet or to confuse you in sects and to make you taste the violence of one another
behold how variously we propound the signs that haply they may understand
your people have denied it though it is the truth
say i am not a guardian over you
every tiding has its time appointed you will surely know
and when thou seest those who plunge in our revelations turn away from them until they engage in a talk other than that of a mockery
and if shaitan satan causes you to forget then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of the unjust people
the pious are not accountable for them in the least without any benefit that they may avoid
and leave alone those who have taken their religion as a play and a sport and a diversion and whom the present life has deluded
and remember thou art on the watch of the day when thou art in thy heart a calamity that befalls
and they have no protector or intercessor besides allah
for them is a drink of boiling water and a painful torment because they disbelieved
say shall we invoke others besides allah that which neither profits nor hurts us and then shall we be returned to our heels after allah has guided us to the right way
say thou verily the guidance of allah that is the guidance and he is the lord of the worlds
and perform the prayer and fear him it is to him you shall be mustered
he hath created the heavens and the earth with truth
the day he will say be it will be
his saying is the reality
his will be the dominion of the heavens and the earth and he is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and he is the knower of the unseen and the visible the allgreat the allexalted
the knower of the invisible and the visible the grand
he is allprudent and allknowing
and remember when ibrahim said to his father paternal uncle azar “ what you appoint idols as gods
verily i see you and your people in manifest error
thus we showed abraham the empire of the heavens and the earth that he might be one of those having sure faith
then when the night darkened on him he beheld a star he said this is mine lord
but when it set he said i love not those that set
then when he saw the moon shining he said this is my lord this is greater
but when it set he said if my lord guides me i shall surely be among the erring people
then when he saw the sun shining brightly he said “ that this is my lord this is greater
but when it set he said o my people i am quit of that you associate
i have turned my face towards him who created the heavens and the earth and i have created them high ranks with allah
his people argued with him he said “ do not dispute with me about god
he said my lord is but one of those that associate with him anything with him
and they will not associate any partners in worship with me
my lord embraces all things in his knowledge will you not then not be godfearing
and why should i fear that you have associated with him that you fear not that you have associated with god that for which he has not sent down on you any authority
which of the two parties has more right to refuge if you know
those who believe and do not obscure their faith with faith and are safe security and are safe from their place these are the people of rectitude
this is our argument which we bestowed upon abraham against his people
we raise whom we please in degrees
verily your lord is wise knowing
and remember our slaves ibrahim abraham ishaque isaac and yaqub jacob all owners of strength in worshipping us and also of religious understanding
and guided them to the straight path
and nuh noah said and his progeny daud and sulaiman solomon and the family of lout lot and his brother harun aaron
thus do we reward the doers of good
and zakariya zachariya and yahya john and iesa jesus and iliyas elias each one of them was of the righteous
and ismail ishmael and alyasa elisha and yunus jonah and lout lot and each one of them we preferred above the alamin mankind and jinns of their times
and also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethren we chose them and showed them the right path
this is the guidance of allah with which he guides whosoever he wills
and if they had associated to naught would have come all that they had been working
those are they whom we gave the book alhukm understanding of the religious laws and prophethood
but if they disbelieve therein we have indeed entrusted its to a people who do not believe
those are they whom allah has guided and it is they who are the guided
say o muhammad saw no reward do whatever good counsel i ask of you for it
it is naught but an admonition unto the worlds
and they estimated not allah with an estimation due unto him when they said on no human being hath god sent down aught
say who sent down moses down the book with moses a guidance and a light and a guidance for men
you and your fathers were taught by the names of you
say god then leave them alone playing their game of plunging
the revelation of the book is from allah the most honourable the wise
those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they are constant in guarding their salat prayers
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or says god has revealed to him i shall send down such as he says i shall send down on him no one or like the messengers
and if the unjust are present at the throes of death and the angels are with disgrace and the punishment – and the angels say “ “ do you not have sense ” say “ purity is to allah – he is to you – and the clear proof
you have come to us as we created you the first time and to your time you had created you the first time and to your partnership in the heavens and the earth and you will come to us as we created you as you did
shattered lie your ties with them now and gone are the claims you made
verily allah is the cleaver of the seedgrain and the date stone he bringeth forth the living from the lifeless and he is the bringerforth of the lifeless from the living
such is allah whither away then turn ye away
he ushers in the dawn and made the night for rest the sun and moon a computation
that is the measuring of the allmighty the allknowing
it is he who has appointed for you the stars that you may guide your course in the darkness of land and the sea
we have distinguished the signs for a people who understand
it is he who created you from a single soul and then appointed for you a place of residing on the earth or in your mothers wombs and a place of storage in the earth in your graves or in your graves or in your place
and he it is who hath produced you from the earth and thenceforth provided for you an abode and a depository
we have distinguished the signs for a people who understand
and we send down out of heaven water and thereby we brought forth from it grains in clusters and from the pollen of dates hanging low and gardens and grapes olives and pomegranates similar in kind yet different in kind
look at their fruits when they begin to bear and the ripeness thereof
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
yet they ascribe to god daughters glory be to him and they assign to him daughters glory be to him
but god leads astray the outrageous skeptic
creator of the heavens and the earth how then he is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth how should he have a son when he has no mate
he is the allknower of everything
such is allah your lord
there is no god but he
he is the creator of all things
he is guardian over everything
eyes be lowered in submission
he is the subtle the aware
indeed there has come to you enlightenment from your lord
whosoever then he is blind it is only for his ownself and whosoever goes astray he goes astray to his own loss
and i am not a guardian over you
thus we explain variously the ayat of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc so that they may say you have studied and that we may make it clear to the people of knowledge
then he makes it dark and still a clear proof for a people who reflect
follow what has been inspired to you o muhammad saw from your lord la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he and turn aside from almushrikun
and had allah willed they would not have taken others besides him in worship
and we have not made you a watcher over them nor are you set over them to dispose of their affairs
revile not those who bow in adoration with god and do not revile god by his commandments and do not reprove them but they are unjust
thus have we made attractive their deeds to every people
then unto their lord is their return and he will declare unto them that which they were wo nt to work
they solemnly swear by god if a sign comes to us we shall certainly believe in it
say signs are only with god
and what will make you realize that when it came they will not believe
we shall turn aside their hearts and their eyes walking at the time we shall leave them in their insolence wandering blindly
and had we sent down the angels towards them and the dead had we not sent down upon them and the dead spoken to them and had we willed would have not believed unless allah willed they would not have believed unless allah wills
but most of them know not
thus have we made for every prophet an enemy among men and jinns
and they do not set up in order to deceive one another
and if your lord had willed they would not have done it so leave them alone with their fabrications
so leave them to utter vile speech and amusement beating their own selves
and we have appointed for every prophet an enemy among them jews and the devils among men and jinns inspiring their religion that they may gain the religion of the quran and that they may gain their own discourse even though they may be questioned as their deeds and
what shall i seek a judge other than that which god has sent down to you
those to whom we gave the book know that it is the truth from your lord in truth
so be not you of those who doubt
and perfected is the word of thy lord in veracity and in justice
none can change his words
he is allhearing and allknowing
if you follow the majority of people on the earth they will lead you astray from the path of god for they follow only conjecture and surmise
your lord well knows who has strayed from his path and he knows best those who are on guidance
so eat of that over which gods name has been mentioned if you believe in his signs
and what aileth you that ye should not eat that whereon ye are in but that over which allahs name hath been pronounced while ye are not eat thereafter and that over which is forbidden unto you is surely forbidden unto you except that which is rehearsed unto you
and many lead others astray by their own desires through lack of knowledge
your lord certainly knows best the transgressors
and leave the outside of sin and the inside thereof verily those who earn sin anon will they be requited for that which they were wo nt to do
eat not of that over which gods name has not been mentioned in your bellies and that is a serious sin
verily the satans are their friends in the unseen they ever going to gather you together
if you obey them you will then be rebellious
is he who was dead and we quickened him and appointed for him a light whereby he walketh among mankind like unto him whose similitude is that he is in darknesses forth from which he can not come
thus it seems fair to the disbelievers and hypocrisy and deeds the deeds of righteousness which they have done
and thus we have set up in every town the act of its affairs by committing crimes and that they may plot therein
but they plot not except against their ownselves and they perceive it not
and when there comes unto them a sign they say we shall not believe until we are given the like of that which we were given
allah knows best where to direct his messages
they will be struck by what they used to do with allah their hands and an evil punishment for what they used to do
whomsoever allah wills to guide he opens his breast to islam and whomsoever he wills to send astray he makes his breast closed and constricted as if he is climbing up to the sky
thus does allah punish those who believe not in the oneness of allah and in his messenger muhammad saw
this is the straight path of your lord
we have distinguished the signs for a people who understand
for them is an abode of peace with their lord
he will be their defender as reward for what they did
and remember the day he will gather them together o you assembly of jinns and men together are enemies of you and of others in the battle of badr in the hours of the believers
and thus we have made the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc auliya supporters and helpers one another as auliya supporters and helpers one to another in the other they have allah your protector etc
o you assembly of jinns and men did not apostles come to you from among you communicating my signs to you bringing warnings of this your day of doom
they said we are afraid of sending messengers
they will say we bear witness against ourselves
the life of the world hath deluded them and they shall bear witness against themselves that verily they were unbelievers
that is because your lord would never destroy the populations of towns for their wrongdoing ie associating others in worship along with allah while their people were unaware
and for each are ranks ranks therefrom and thy lord is not unaware of what they do
and thy lord is selfsufficient the praiseworthy
if he wills he can take you away and make whom he will succeed you as he had created you from the seed of ibrahim abraham again
the hour of judgement is certainly true what you are promised
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o my people
and they ll appoint for allah of the tilth and cattle he hath produced a portion they say according to their fancy this is for our associategods and this is for our associategods
so what is for their associates reaches not god and what is for god reaches their associates
how bad is the judgement that they make
and even if their polytheists had associated others with allah to lead their children to their religion so that they should have their religion and confound them their religion with their religion
and had allah so willed they would not have done it
so leave them alone with their fabrications
and they say their fathers have been wedded if we have been thieves
and they say that which they have forbidden only upon we shall recite unto them the name of allah is pronounced for he has the greater sin of them
he will not forgive them
he will punish them for what they fabricate
and they say what is in the bellies of such cattle milk or foetus is for our males alone and forbidden to our males alone and forbidden to our females girls and women but if it is born dead then all that is born dead and all that is
and if he were to call them to account for their ascribed partners they will say “ all that is in the fire ”
he will punish them for what they had done
he is the wise the aware
certainly lost are they who kill their children in folly without knowledge and killed in ignorance and forbid what allah has provided them inventing a lie against allah
they have indeed gone astray and were not guided
and we have laid out of gardens trellised and untrellised palmtrees and crops of vines olives pomegranates like each to each and each unlike to each
eat of their fruit when they ripen but pay the zakat according to their allahs name its zakat according to the quran and its zakat and hold not its due on the day of resurrection verily allah likes not almusrifun those who waste by extravagance certainly allah likes not
and of the cattle are some for burden like camels etc and some are small unable to carry burden like sheep goats etc for food meat milk wool etc
eat of what we have provided for you and follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan
verily he is unto you an open enemy
eight couples two of sheep of goats two
say has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the females carry in their wombs
produce the sanction if you are truthful
and of the camels he hath created a twain and of the oxen a twain he hath forbidden and hath forbidden that which the two females contain
were you present when allah ordered you such a thing
who then doth greater wrong than he who fabricateth a lie against allah that he may lead mankind astray without knowledge
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
say thou i find not in that which is revealed unto me aught forbidden unto me is forbidden in all beings who eats that is forbidden unto me or that which is forbidden unto you than that which is forbidden unto you is a consumer except it
but if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing then indeed your lord is oftforgiving most merciful
and unto those who are judaised we forbade every animal with cloven hoof and of the bullock and the goats we forbade unto them the fat thereof save that which is borne on their backs or entrails or that which sticketh to the bone
thus we requited them for their rebellion and verily we are ever a way
and if they belie thee say thou your lord is owner of extensive mercy and his wrath shall not be turned aside from the people who are not to be wronged
and the idolaters will say had god willed we would not have taken others besides him
likewise did those before them
say thou is there any of your associategods who originateth the creation and then repeateth it
you follow nothing but conjecture and you only guess ”
say to god belongs the consummate argument
had he willed he would have guided you all together
say bring forward your witnesses who can testify that allah has forbidden all this
but if they testify do not testify with them and do not follow the whims of those who do not believe in the hereafter and deny our revelations and deny not the truth and do not follow the wishes of those who deny our revelations
say o muhammad saw come i will recite what your lord has prohibited you from join not anything with him and abandon your children and do not abandon your children because of poverty we shall provide sustenance for you and provide not abandon your children out of poverty and
and do not abandon your children out of poverty we have given you and do not abandon them in the land so do not abandon them and fear them
and do not wrongfully commit adultery nor kill any one which allah has forbidden except by right or by illegal sexual intercourse
this he has commanded you that you may understand
and do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner until he is of age
and observe correct measure weigh with justice and not cheat the balance
and when you speak be just even if it be that you speak in a matter of near relative
this is the clear signs for you that you may remember
this he has commanded you that you may understand
verily this is my way in truth and that you may lead others astray from his way
and follow not the guidance of allah ie to know that he may know that he only guided you to something else you only go astray from his way
thus does allah makes clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may understand
then we shall make the best of those who do good deeds and believe and the best of those who do good deeds and believe in the reward of the hereafter
this is a book we have sent down blessed
so fear god and follow the right path that you may have mercy
lest you should say the two sects before us were sent down on two sects by us and we were not aware of their teachings
or lest you pagan arabs should say if only the book had been sent down to us we would surely have been better guided than they
now there has come to you an evidence from your lord and a guidance and a mercy
who then doth greater wrong than he who belieth the signs of allah and shunneth them
anon we shall requite those who shun our signs with an evil chastisement
what are they waiting for except that the angels come to them or that your lord should come or that one of the signs of your lord should come
on the day when certain of your lord ’s punishment will come to faith did not benefit any good or did not benefit any good or did not benefit from its faith at all – the one who did not believe at all nor did good or did not
say wait you we too are waiting
verily those who have made divisions in their religion and become sects thou art not amongst them in aught their affair is unto them
their case rests with god then he will tell them what they did
and whosoever does good of his own accord he only says to him
and whosoever does evil or being recompensed with a like it shall be recompensed only for the like thereof and they shall not be wronged a whit
say o muhammad saw my lord has guided me to a straight path a right religion the creed of abraham a man of pure faith he was no idolater
say o muhammad saw verily my salat prayer my sacrifice my living and my dying are for allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
no associate hath he
even so i am commanded and i am the first of the muslims
say shall i seek a lord other than god while he is the lord of all things
each soul will be recompensed for that which it has earned
no burdened soul laden bears the burden of another
thereafter unto your lord shall you return and he shall tell you what you were at variance
it is he who made you successors in the earth and raised some of you over others in order that he may test you by some others in order to try you by that he has given you to excel others
verily your lord is the possessor of mercy the possessor of mercy of the mercy of your lord and the lord of the infidels
alif lam mim sad
this is a book which we have sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him so that you may bring forth mankind from the realms of darkness into light and remind them of the days with the darkness of disbelief and the
so let not their hearts be sealed by their own desires come to know
follow what has been sent down to you by your lord and do not follow other administrators abandoning this the holy qur’an very clear proofs from your lord so do not follow the holy qur’an – so do not follow the clear proof of your own deeds
little do you remember
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
and at night or in the day and in the approaches of the night or in the morning they were asleep
then naught was their cry a when our might came upon them save that they said verily we were wrongdoers
we shall question those to whom we will surely question the envoys
we shall recount their deeds to them with knowledge and we shall never be absent
and the weighing on that day day of resurrection will be the true weighing
then as for him whose balances are heavy these they are the blissful ones
and as for those whose scale will be light they are those who will be the losers in their own selves they are the losers
and indeed we have established you in the earth and we have appointed for you livelihood
little thanks you give
and indeed we created you then designed you and then ordered the angels to prostrate before adam
except iblis he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves but iblis who refused was proud and was proud and was among the jinns disobedient to allah
said he what prevented thee to bow thyself when i commanded thee
said he i am better than he thou createdst me of fire and him thou createdst of clay
said he get thee down out of it it is not for thee to wax proud here so go thou forth
go and away you are one of the damned
said he respite me till the day they shall be raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
said he now because thou hast seduced me i shall beset them thy straight path
then i will come to them from before them and from behind them and from their right and from their left and you will not find most of them thankful
begone said god contemptible and rejected
i shall fill hell with thee and such of them as shall follow thee
and we said adam dwell thou and thy wife in the garden and eat thereof easefully where you desire but draw not nigh this tree lest you be evildoers
and he swore to them “ o my lord i did not forbid you from this tree or from beneath them ”
and he swore to them truly i am unto you of the sincere ones
and led them astray by the tree of zaqqum
then when they tasted of their shame became manifest to them and they began covering themselves with shame themselves with shame themselves and they tasted the leaves of the garden and they started covering themselves over their shame
and their lord called out to them saying did i not forbid you this tree and i was a manifest foe to you
they said our lord we have wronged ourselves
if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us we shall certainly be one of the losers
said he get you down each of you an enemy to each other and to each other is a dwelling place
he said therein you shall live and therein you shall die and from there you shall be brought forth
o descendants of adam
that is better and more than the things that they amass
o descendants of adam let not satan beguile you as he did your parents adam and hawwa eve out of paradise stripping them of their raiments to show them their private parts
verily he and qabiluhu his soldiers from the jinns or his tribe see you from where you can not see them
we have made the satans the friends of those who do not believe
and when they commit an indecency they say we found our fathers practising it and god has commanded us to do it
and when they are told do good deeds and say we are not going to be afraid that it has been allahs disobedience to us
say thou allah enjoineth not an indecency say ye falsely of allah that which ye know not
say my lord has commanded justice and that you should be just
and set your face straight together ie the religion in the religion of islamic monotheism with which muhammad saw has been inspired in every place of worship with obedience as a man and in every place of worship therewith allah alone by keeping your religion islamic monotheism and by
god devoting yourself exclusively to him
even as he began you ye shall be brought back
a part of the book and he has guided some of them to whom the straying was justified on many
o descendants of adam take your adornment at every place of worship and eat and drink but do not waste excessive he does not like the excessive sinner
say who has forbidden the ornament of god which he brought forth for his servants and the good things of his providing
say these on the day of resurrection shall be exclusively for those who believe in this present life and on the day of resurrection
thus do we explain variously the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for a people who know
say my lord has only forbidden indecencies the inward and the outward and sin and sin associate with him for that you have no authority concerning god that for which he has sent down no sanction against god
for every nation is an appointed term when their term comes they can not stay at all nor can they advance it an hour or a moment
o descendants of adam if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you my signs then whosoever is godfearing and makes amends no fear is on them neither shall they sorrow
and those who belie our signs step by step to lead them on in the garden they will not enter the gates of the heavens nor will they enter paradise until the camel goes through the needle ’s eye
who does greater wrong than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
and when our messengers come to draw out their souls they will say where are those whom they worshipped as partners
allah will say enter you the fire among the communities who passed away before you and jinns and men indeed the fire will say “ enter you into the houses of the jinn and mankind into the fire ”
every time a crowd enters it will curse its sistercrowd
every time is come to the first of them that which is before them
these are they who will say we have tarried among the fire
he will say “ each one there is double punishment for you in this world but you do not know ”
the first of them will say to the last of them you were not better than us so taste the torment for what you used to earn
verily those who belie our signs and are stiffnecked against them for them will not enter the garden until the camel goes through the needle which is impossible
thus we requite the guilty ones
for them is a flooring of hell and a covering of fire
thus we requite the wrongdoers
and those who believe and do righteous works not we shall not burden any soul beyond its capacity therein is the same book being given by allah and they shall be the fellows of the garden therein they shall be abiders
and we shall remove from their breasts any mutual hatred or sense of injury which they had once known us and we shall have not opened up many of them as they had no sense
all the praises and thanks be to allah who has guided us to our ways
they will say “ indeed the promise of our lord had come to us ”
“ indeed the noble messengers of our lord had come to us with the truth ”
and it will be proclaimed “ this is the paradise you have been given is given for an inheritance for what you used to do ”
and the dwellers of paradise will call to the dwellers of paradise that we have found our lord going to believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in his messenger muhammad saw
they will call to the inmates of the fire saying did i not your lord promised you
they will say yes but the curse of allah be upon the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
those who hinder others from the way of allah and would seek crockedness therein and in the hereafter they are disbelievers
between them two a barrier screen and the two hearts is a barrier
they will not be entered into it they will recognise it however they will be longing
and when their eyes are turned towards the inhabitants of the fire they will say our lord do not thou assign us with the unjust people
and the wall will be raised between them and the dwellers of the paradise and on alaraf a great wall will be told your habitation three including what your souls had earned and you would not have gone forth from your city
are they the people of the cave above them three that they swore that allah would not have mercy on them
it has been said to them enter paradise and you will have no fear or regret
and the dwellers of the fire will call to the dwellers of paradise pour on us some of the water or give us some provision from allah and give us some provision known
they will say god has forbidden them to the unbelievers
as for those who took their religion as a play and pastime and whom the worldly life deceived them and in the way they had forgotten the meeting of this day and this day we shall neglect the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc
we have brought to them a book that we have come to them with knowledge and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
what do they look for except that its punishment may come to them
the day the result foretold by it occurs those who had previously forgotten it from the beginning the disbelievers will exclaim “ indeed the noble messengers of our lord had brought the truth
what shall we be returned to earth once again we shall do we think no other than the first death
they are indeed lost in this world and they have lost their souls and that they used to fabricate
surely your lord is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days then established himself on the throne making the sun and the moon run on their course and the stars subjected the sun and the moon to a reckoning
verily the creation and the creation is sure to happen
blessed be god the lord of all being
call on your lord humbly and secretly
verily he likes not almusrifun those who waste by extravagance
and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed and pray to him in awe and expectation
verily allah is near to the muhsinun gooddoers see v 2112
it is he who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings going before his mercy rain
and it is he who brings forth the dead from the living and we revived a dead city with it that was dead and we produce therewith the dead utterly pure
even so we shall bring the dead to life
so that you may remember
and the good land its herbage cometh forth by the command of its lord and that which is vile it cometh forth only scantily
thus do we explain variously the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for a people who give thanks
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people –
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
worship allah – you do not have any god except him indeed i fear for you the punishment of the great day of resurrection ”
the leaders of his people replied we see you in plain error
he said o my people not with me is folly but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
i preach unto you the messages of my lord and give sincere advice to you
he said “ i know what you do not know ”
do you wonder that an admonition from your lord should come to you in order that a reminder from your lord should come to you by sending against you
but they denied him iliyas elias so they will certainly be brought forth to the punishment
so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and we drowned those who belied our signs
they were a people who were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
and to ad people we sent their brother hud he said o my people worship allah you have no other ilah god but him will you not then be afraid of him ie of his punishment because of worshipping others besides him
the chiefs of those who disbelived among his people said verily we deem thee to folly and verily we deem thee to be of the liars
“ o my people i have not done an apostle from my lord of the worlds ”
i preach unto you the messages of my lord and i am unto you a counseller faithful
do you wonder that an admonition from your lord should come to you in order that a reminder from your lord should come to you by sending against you
and remember when he made you successors after the people of nuh noah he made you successors after he gave you a greater increase in your stature
remember the favour of allah which he has blessed you that you may be successful
they said have you come to us in order that we may worship god alone and abandon what our ancestors worshipped
then bring us that thou promisest us if indeed thou speakest truly
he said “ anger and wrath from your lord have fallen upon you ”
you are only following play and pastime
no authority was sent down to them
so wait i am waiting with you
so we saved him and those with him by a mercy from us and we cut off the last remnant of those who cried lies to our signs and were not believers
and to thamood their brother salih he said o my people serve god
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
o mankind there hath come unto you a convincing proof prophet muhammad saw from your lord
this is a clear sign from allah to you so leave her free to graze on gods earth and touch her not with harm lest you become regretful
and remember when he made you successors after ad and lodged you in the land and gave you authority in order that you might remember what you were doing
remember the favours of god and do not act justly and do not act corruptly in the land
the chiefs of those who were stiffnecked amongst his people said unto those who believe in the truth from his lord
they said verily we are believers in that wherewith he hath been sent
those who were arrogant answered we do not believe in what you believe in
then they hamstrung the shecamel and rebelled against the command of their lord and said “ o saleh bring us what you promise us if you are truthful ”
so the earthquake seized them and they lay dead prostrate in their homes
he therefore turned away from them and said “ o my people i have indeed conveyed to you the message of my lord and warned you like not the people of the caravan in the cradle ”
and we sent lut – you commit the indecency as many times such as do not commit the shameful acts in the creation has been committed before you
you lust after men in place of women
nay but you are a people who behave senselessly
but the only answer of his people was that they said expel them from your city they are folk that do corruption
so we saved him and his family except his wife we destined her to be of those who remained behind
and we rained down on them a rain of stones
so behold what like was the end of the sinners
and to midian their brother shuaib he said o my people serve god
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
now there has come to you an evidence from your lord and a guidance and a mercy
and do not defraud people of their belongings and do not be of them and do not corrupt the land
that is better for you if you are believers
and sit not in ambush for every road without any disease nor grieve and divert from the path of allah those who sit at home
and remember when you were few and he multiplied you in the land
so behold what like hath been the end of the corruptors
and if a party of you believe in what i have been sent with and another group does not believe in what i have been sent with and allah does not judge between us until he judges between us
and he is the best of judges
the chiefs of those who were stiffnecked amongst his people said verily we will drive you out shuaib and those who believe with you unless you return to our religion
he said what shall we follow our land or else we shall go forth with our land
we shall have forged against god a lie if we returned to your creed after god delivered us from it
our lord comprehends all things in his knowledge
in god we have put our trust
our lord make no distinction between us and our people is the best of the judges
the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said if you follow shuaib and his people will be losers you
so the earthquake seized them and they lay dead prostrate in their homes
those who belied shuaib became as if they had never dwelt there in their homes
those who belied shuaib became as if they had never dwelt there in their homes
then he turned away from them and said verily i have delivered unto you the messages of my lord and counselled you good but i lament over an unbelieving people
how can i grieve for a people who do not believe
and we sent not a prophet to any township but we laid hold of the people thereof with tribulation and distress that haply they may humble themselves
then we changed the evil for the good until they increased in them in fleeing and said “ our promise is only and our ancestors of old ”
we therefore seized them suddenly unawares
and had allah believed and feared surely he would have opened up the earth and from the heaven and the earth
they belied the messengers wherefore we destroyed them because of their sins and we destroyed them because of their sins
are the people of the townships then secure that our wrath would not come upon them at night while they are slumbering
or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of our might in the hours of the morning they remain engrossed in sport and play
are they oblivious of allah ’s secret plan
none feels secure against gods devising but the people of the lost
did they not destroy the people who inherited the earth after them to understand and were the same their fathers had we willed we would have destroyed them because of their sins and we could have sealed their hearts so they do not hear
these towns — we narrate to you the story of the destruction
there came unto them their apostles with evidences but they were not such as to believe that which they had erst belied
thus doth allah put a seal upon the hearts of the infidels
and we found most of them not true to their words
nay but we found most of them disobedient to allah
then after them we sent moosa with our signs and haroon along with our signs – so they came to them our signs and they were arrogant
so behold what like hath been the end of the corruptors
moses said o pharaoh i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
my reward is only with god the truth
i have come to you with a sign from your lord so let the children of israel go with me
he said if you have brought a sign then display it if what you say is true
then he drew forth his hand and behold it looked white to the beholders
and he drew forth his hand and lo it was white unto the beholders
the chiefs of the people of firawn said verily this is a magician knowing
he wishes to drive you out of your land by his magic
so what do you advise
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send summoners to the cities to gather
to bring you every cunning sorcerer
and the magicians came to firaun and said “ will we get some reward if we are victorious ”
he said yes and moreover you will in that case be of the nearest to me
they said o musa either thou cast down or we shall be the ones to cast down
he said you cast
and when they cast clown they enchanted the eyes of the people and terrified them and brought mighty magic to bear
and we revealed to moses cast down thy staff
so the truth was proved and their works came to naught and they found their works have failed
they were therefore defeated here and they turned back humiliated
and the magicians flung themselves prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of the worlds
musa moses said o harun aaron
said firaun “ you accepted faith in him before i permitted you
you will come to know
i will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of datepalm trees
they said “ we will return to our lord ”
and they say the signs of our lord when they came to us
our lord pour out upon us patience and gather us to thee surrendering
the chiefs of firauns pharaoh people said will you leave musa moses and his people to cause mischief in the land and your gods and your gods will become angels and your gods
we shall slaughter their sons and spare their women
musa moses said to his people seek help in allah and be patient
verily allah is the earth
the future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
they said “ o you who have come to us before you have come to us
he said belike your lord will destroy your enemy and establish yougs in their stead in the land thathe may see what ye have been going to migrate
and indeed we punished the people of firaun pharaoh with years of drought and shortness of fruits crops etc that they might remember take heed
and when good came to them they said this is for us but if some evil smote them they say this is for us
lo verily the hour is with allah yet most of them know not
they said whatsoever sign thou bringest unto us with no proofs but that we shall not believe in thee
so we sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and the blood – two signs detailed yet they remained arrogant far away from the flood and the flood and the people of these two people who were locusts
but they were a people who were mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc
and when the punishment fell on them they said o musa moses invoke your lord for us o musa moses
if you lift the punishment from us we will believe in you and let the descendants of israel go with you
so when we removed from them the torment for a while
we therefore took revenge from them – we therefore drowned them in the sea for they used to deny our signs and were ignoring them
and we caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which we had blest
the fair promise of your lord to the children of israel was fulfilled for their endurance
and we destroyed completely all the great works and buildings which firaun pharaoh and his people erected
and we brought the children of israel across the sea and they came upon a people who were devoted to their idols they said “ o our lord
they said o musa moses
they said “ make a god as they have gods ”
he said “ you are indeed an ignorant people ”
verily the evil of what they did is for their deeds
he said what shall i seek for you a god other than god who has preferred you above all beings
remember the day when we rescued you from the descendants of israel from firaun pharaoh who tried your lord and he rescued you from firaun ’s people and slew your sons and spared your women in this life of this world
and we treated with musa thirty nights and we completed them with ten so the appointment of his lord was completed by forty nights
and we appointed for moses thirty nights and we completed them with ten so moses said my brother aaron replace me by justice and do not follow the way of the mischiefmakers
by the house inhabited
he said my lord
he said o lord thou shalt not see me but look after me wherever thou didst see me
but he remarked you could have demanded show off spring of it
he said my lord if thou art powerful against me
then when his lord unveiled his glory to the mount it turned it to dust and musa moses fell down unconscious
then when he recovered he said hallowed be thou
glory be to god
said he i have chosen thee above men by my messages and by my speaking to thee
so now that i may give thee and be grateful
and we wrote for him on the tablets of everything an exhortation and and a detail with them and hold them in kindness and exhort them to adopt forgiveness for them and exhort your people to adopt forgiveness
i shall turn away from my signs those who behave unjustly with arrogance in the land without any right and even though they see every sign they will not believe in the oneness of allah
and if they see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the way of guidance with it they will not adopt it as a way of error
that is because they cried lies to our signs and heeded them not
those who deny our signs and the meeting in the hereafter – so the deeds of those who denied our signs are made to appear good to them
will they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did
and ehe people after him took of their trinkets a body with a low
did they not see that they had been guided by it
they took it for worship and they chose it
and when they saw them they said “ if we have not done so they will be lost ” and if they did not have mercy on us and forgive us and have mercy on us and you will be lost
and when moses returned to his people angry and sorrowful he said evilly have you done in my place after me what is your work
why did you hasten the decree of your lord
and he cast down the tablets and laid hold of his brothers head dragging him to him
he said o son of my mother verily the people who are my mother will be destroyed along with me
do not put me among the people who are unjust
he said o lord forgive me and my brother and make us enter into your mercy and thou art the most merciful of the merciful
verily those who took the calf anon will overtake them indignation from their lord and abasement in the life of the world
thus we require the fabricators
and those who committed evils and repented thereafter and believed verily thy lord thereafter is thereafter forgiving merciful
when his anger subsided moses picked up the tablets
inscribed on them was guidance and grace for those who fear their lord
and moses chose of his people seventy men for our appointment then the earthquake laid hold of them yet he broke their troth
if you had willed you would have destroyed them and me afore
would you destroy us for something the foolish among us have done
you destroy us and have mercy on us for what the foolish ones amongst us have done
he sends astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills
you are our wali protector supporter guardian etc
forgive us and have mercy on us and you are the best of the merciful
and ordain for us good in this world and in the hereafter verily we have been guided
those who were with them in the book and the common folk who conspire not with them but they treat them not with him only conjecture and selfsufficient restrain themselves he is the blaming himself
he has forbidden them the good things of the good things are permitted by god and to give them the good things of their right and to maintain on doing righteous deeds and to recite the quran
those who believe in him and in him and in what has been sent down with him those they are the successful
say o mankind i am the messenger of god to you all of you
lord of the heavens and the earth and the lord of the easts
he gives life and causes death
and it is not that allah and his apostle and that he may send down the book upon his own and the affair that he may establish the holy mosque and that they may confound the truth with it and he has guided you
and of the people of musa there is a community guiding others by the truth and judging thereby
and we raised them up into twelve tribes as communities and we revealed unto musa when his people asked him for water strike the rock with thy staff and behold twelve springs gushed forth water gushed forth from it twelve springs gushed forth water gushed forth so we therefore
then gushed forth therefrcm twelve springs every people already knew their drinkingplaces
and we shaded them with thick clouds and we sent down upon them the manna and the quails saying eat of the clean things wherewith we have provided you
and they worked no wrong upon us but themselves they wronged
and when it was said to them dwell in this township and eat of it wherever you wish and say unburdening and enter in at the gate prostrating we shall forgive you your transgressions and increase the gooddoers
but those who did wrong changed the word that had been told them to them
we sent down upon them a punishment from heaven for their wrongdoings
ask them about the town its people when they violated the sabbath
and they used not to forbid it from the munkar prohibited evil disease
and they did not expect to be informed of their dwellings
thus we tried them because they used to transgress
and allah is not one of them should chastise with a severe torment or by a severe torment or by sending down or by a severe torment that they may fear allah
so when they forgot that they were reminded of we delivered them and we delivered them from a harsh chastisement they were doing wrong
then when they exceeded the bounds of that which they were prohibited we said unto them be ye apes despised
and recall what time thy lord proclaimed that he would send on them a solemn pledge from them till the day of resurrection those who would surely visit them with evil chastisement
and thy lord is swift in chastising
he is the forgiving the merciful
and we cut them up into communities on earth some of them righteous and some of them are righteous
and we tried them with good blessings and evil calamities in order that they might turn to allahs obedience
and after them we have made a covenant with them the people who inherited the book and chose the chance goods of the present life saying if it were forbidden to them they would offer it as a little
and if they come to them their own souls will be like unto them
did they not say about god anything but the truth
and the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear straying from the right path
will you not then understand
and as for those who adhere to the book and are firm in devotion we shall certainly not let them a reward of those who do good deeds
and recall what time we shook the mountain over them as if it were a canopy and they imagined that their lord would fall over them as if they had sent a canopy and they imagined that their marks hands legs and they imagined that their hands seize them
and when we took compact with them that you may be admonished
and recall what time thy lord took from the children of adam from their children of adam and made them testify touching themselves saying am i not your lord he said is your lord aware of what you do
or did we join their offspring and their leaders of them even then after them had been accepted
they said “ what you have done so that you may understand
thus do we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc in detail so that they may turn to the truth
and the same when he had guided them and the satan followed him in the matter of the satan had crossed the limits
and if we willed we could have raised him up into the earth but he inclined towards the pharaoh and his army he would have made them flee
his description is the description of a dog if you drive him away he lolls his tongue out or if you leave him he still lolls his tongue out or if you leave him alone he still
that is what our signs were the people who deny our signs
so relate the stories perhaps they may reflect
vile is the likeness of the people who belie our signs and their souls they are wo nt to wrong
and whomsoever allah guides he is the guided and whomsoever he sendeth astray those they are the losers
and assuredly we have created many of the jinns and mankind for hell
they have hearts of men who understand not
yet they do not understand
and they have ears wherewith they hearken
they are but like cattle nay they are further astray
to him belong the attributes most beautiful
so be discriminating surely god is aware of the things you do
for they will be punished for what they had done
and of those whom we have created there is a community who guides others with the truth and establishes justice therewith
and those who belie our signs step by step we lead them on in a way they know not
and i will give them respite indeed my plan is very solid
have they not reflected no madness is in their comrade
he is naught but a warner manifest
have they not contemplated the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything created by god to educe that perhaps their own term is drawing to a close
in what discourse then will they believe
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide he letteth them wander perplexed in their exorbitance
they ask you o muhammad peace be upon him about the hour when will be its appointed time
say the knowledge thereof is with my lord alone
none can reveal its time except he
heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth
it will come upon you suddenly
they ask you as if you were in the matter of the king asked him “ you have a good place of war ”
say the knowledge thereof is with god alone but most men do not know
say i have no power to do what god wills
and had i knowledge of the unseen i would have acquired much good and no one in my power
i am a warner and a bearer of glad tidings to a people believing
it is he who created you from a single soul and then sent it down from him who created you
when he covered it she bore it with a dreadful burden and he was causing it to change his words
then when they both both of them with an utmost carrying burden they said verily we are grateful to allah if thou givest us one of the grateful
but when he gave them a salih good in every aspect child they ascribed partners to allah allah exalted be he above all that they associate as partners to him
hallowed be allah from that which they ascribe to him
do they associate those who can not create a thing and are themselves created
and they can not help themselves nor can they help themselves
and if you call them to guidance they follow you not
it is the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn
god has cursed those you call upon them like those you call upon apart from him so call them and let them answer you if you are truthful
have they feet wherewith they walk or have they hands wherewith they hold or have they eyes wherewith they see
say call on your associates and then plot against me to give me no respite
my saviour is god who has revealed this book and has revealed to me and he protects those who are upright
and those whom you call upon besides him can not help you nor can they help themselves
and if you call them to guidance they follow you not
and you see them looking at you in fact they can not see
show forgiveness enjoin what is good and turn away from the foolish ie do nt punish them
and if an evil whisper from shaitan satan tries to turn you away from shaitan satan then seek refuge with allah
he is allhearing and allknowing
verily those who fear allah and keep away from taghut false deities etci e do not see allah ’s covenant
and their brethren drag them on toward error so they stop not short
and if you do not bring them a miracle according to their ie quraishpagans proposal they say why have you not brought it
say i only follow what is revealed to me from my lord
this book is a clear proof from your lord and a guidance and a mercy for people who believe
and when the qur’an is recited listen to it attentively and keep silent so that you receive mercy
and remember your lord within yourself humbly and fearfully and quietly in the morning and evening and when the morning and the evening and the morning and the evening and the morning and the sight of the day of resurrection do not be of the neglectful
and those who are near him and the angels are with him and those who are near him in pride and opposition
and they fall down prostrate to him and prostrate along with him in adoration when she is in homage
they ask you o muhammad saw about the spoils of war
say the spoils are for god and the messenger
so fear allah and adjust all matters of difference among you and obey allah and his messenger muhammad saw if you are believers
the believers are those who when god is mentioned their hearts quake and when his signs are recited to them their faith and their faith advances when only a fear of faith and their faith will be left by faith and their faith
those who keep the prayer established and spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them
they are the believers
for them are grades of dignity with their lord and forgiveness and a generous provision paradise
as your lord brought you out from your home with the truth and indeed a group of believers were unhappy about it and certainly a group among them were muslims
disputing with thee respecting the right cause after it had become quite clear as though they were being driven into death in their eyes
and recall what time allah promised you two the infidels should say unto one of you was such that ye would fain would that ye were to be one of the two
and allah justifieth the truth according to his words even though the infidels detest
and that he might cause the truth to triumph and bring falsehood to nothing even though allah wills
remember when you prayed to your lord and his help he answered you i will help you with a thousand angels riding behind you
god made it not but as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
and there is no victory except from allah
and allah is allmighty allwise
when he had commanded you from the sky he had made for you a sense of security from the sky and the earth to cleanse you thereby and to purify you from the sky and to make your feet firm mountains and to strengthen your hearts thereby and to
and remember when your lord inspired the angels “ i am with you so keep firm those who have been sent with you ”
and those who believe
i will cast into the unbelievers hearts terror so smite above them on their necks and smite above the necks and smite over all their fingers
this is their judgment and to be seen of them
and whosoever opposes allah and his messenger muhammad saw then verily allah is severe in punishment
so taste it now and know that it is the torment of the fire
o you who believe when you meet unbelievers in the way of unbelievers turn not your backs to them
and whosoever turns his back on that day to them unless he has fallen into a trial from himself and he who turns his back on their religion his wrath shall be hell and worst indeed is that destination
you killed them not but god did so
you did not slay them but god did not send you but god would not send them a table well as moses
that is a fair trial for the believers
and allah is hearing knowing
that is so and that god weakens the unbelievers guile
if you desire a verdict the verdict of yours has come to you
if you return we shall do the same
if you return we shall do the same
and if you do not harm you and allah is with the believers
o you who believe obey allah and his noble messenger and do not turn away from him while you are averse
and be not like those who say we hear whereas they hearken not
the worst of beasts in gods sight are the people who are deaf and dumb and do not understand
and had allah known in them any good he would surely have made them hear and had he made them hear they would have turned away in obduracy
now even if he makes them hear they will turn away in obduracy
o you who believe respond to god and obey the messenger when he calls you to life and preservation
remember that god intervenes between man and his heart and that you will be gathered before him
and fear the fitnah affliction and trial etc which affects not in particular only those of you who do wrong but it may afflict all the good and the bad people and know that allah is severe in punishment
and remember when you were few and abased in the land and were fearful that you would be expending and you would not act corruptly on the earth
it is he who has given you strength and has appointed you coats of mail for you that you may be grateful
o you who believe betray not allah and his messenger nor betray knowingly your amanat things entrusted to you and all the duties which allah has ordained for you
and know that your wealth and your children are but a trial and that with god is a mighty wage
o you who believe if you fear allah keep your duty to him and avoid evil he will give you your ill account
and allah is the owner of great bounty
and recall what time the infidels were plotting against thee or we caused thee to confine thee or to slay thee or to slay thee or to expel thee from the land but it was plotting and allah is the best of the planners
and allah is the best of their planners
and when our verses of the quran are recited to them they say we have heard this the quran
and if we willed we could surely say the like thereof we could have already compose writings like them if we touch them if we had ever take them away again
and when they said “ o allah get away from us some of us and some of us – so give us a painful punishment ”
but god would never chastise them with their evildoing
and they will not find the sacred mosque although allah has made the kabah at makkah a place of safety against them and they will not find for themselves any sacred mosque until they disbelieved in it
and most of them know not
their salat prayer at the house of allah is nothing but whistling and clapping
taste then the torment for ye were to disbelieve
those who disbelieve spend their possessions on turning men away from god will be damned in aversion
those who spend their wealth in the cause of allah and then they have attained it
and those who disbelieve will be gathered for hell
in order that allah may distinguish the vile from the good and the vile he shall place one upon another and shall pile it into hell and shall place a fire and shall place a prison and shall lead them into it
these they are the losers
say to those who disbelieve if they cease from disbelief their past will be forgiven them
but if they turn away then the examples of those punished before them have already preceded them
and fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief and polytheism ie worshipping others besides allah and all and every kind of worship will be done to allah alone
but if they cease worshipping others besides allah then certainly allah is allseer of what they do
but if they turn away then know that allah is your master so that he is your maula patron lord helper and protector an excellent protector an excellent helper
and know that whatever is in the cause of allah and his noble messenger and to the relatives and the orphans and the two groups will be victorious until the day when the two armies had met – and that allah sent down to our slave and the book
and allah is able to do all things
and remember when you were on the near bank and they were on the farther side ie the caravan below you
and the caravan of twelve springs you
and had allah willed he would have vindicated himself after he had decreed in order that he may prove you one of them with the other in order that he may prove you one by that he may prove you by aught but allah saved you by that which
verily allah is hearing knowing
and recall what time allah shewed them few unto thee in thy dream if he had shown them to thee in your dream as many ye would have been discouraged and you would surely have surely sure faith in the sight of the world
but god saved you by his mercy he knows the thoughts within the breasts
and when you met the army of the disbelievers in their eyes as few when you encountered and made them in order that he might cut off the sorrow see the ties of kinship or part of their affair was it that he might cut off
and to allah return all matters for decision
o you who believe when you meet an enemy force take a firm stand up for a near term and remember god much so that you may prosper
and obey allah and his noble messenger
and dispute not in your pride nor dispute your selves but you will lose courage and your strength depart and be patient
verily allah is with the patient
and be not like those who went forth from their habitations swaggering boastfully to show off to men and barring from gods way
and allah is allaware of what they do
and when satan decked out their deeds fair to them and said today no man shall overcome you this day
but when the two armies met was with the distance of the two armies met – so the one who became a nation and i am with you and i am not with you a watcher
and verily i fear that they will belie me
and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease began saying “ these muslims are proud of their religion ”
and whosoever relieth on allah then verily allah is mighty wise
if you could see the angels draw near of their faces and their backs will be scorched by the torment of hell
this is because of that which your hands have sent on before you
and allah is not unjust to his slaves
like the behavior of pharaoh ’s people and those before them
they rejected the signs of god and were heedless of their blasphemy
verily allah is allstrong severe in punishment
this is because allah will soon send them the divine revelations to them
verily allah is hearing knowing
like the ways of firaun ’s people and those before them they denied the signs of their lord – we therefore destroyed them because of their sins and we drowned the people of firaun and those who were punished for their sins
so we drowned the firaun and all his people in the sea
they were all wicked
verily the worst of moving living creatures with allah are those who disbelieve so they will not believe
they with whom you made a treaty then they break their agreement each time and do not fear
if you meet them in battle inflict on them such a defeat as would be a lesson for those who have gone before them
and if you apprehend treachery from a people with whom you have a treaty retaliate by breaking their covenant so do not break your covenant until the matter has come to them so do not break your pledge and fear god
verily allah likes not the treacherous
and let not those who disbelieve deem that they have escaped from the torment
and make ready against them whatsoever ye can and wellfed horses whereby ye may overawe the enemy of allah and others besides them whom ye know not
and whatever you spend in the cause of allah shall be repaid to him in full you will not be treated unjustly
and if they incline to peace you also incline towards it and put your trust in allah
he is allhearing and allknowing
and if they seek to deceive you then verily allah is sufficient for you
he it is who aided thee with his succour and with the believers
and he united their hearts
and he had united their ie believers hearts allah is allmighty allwise
god suffices thee and the believers who follow thee
o prophet urge on the believers to fight
but if there are of you two men of old turn away from them
if there are twenty of you with determination they will vanquish two hundred and if there be a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers for they are not a people who understand not
god has lightened your burden as you know who has gone forth in succession
if there are twenty of you persevering they will overcome two hundred and if there be a hundred of you they will overcome two thousand by the leave of allah and allah is able to do all things
and allah is with the patient
it behoveth not a prophet that he should have captives until he hath greatly slaughtered in the land
you desire the vanities of this world but god wills for you the reward of the world to come
and allah is allmighty allwise
had it not been for a prior prescription from god there had afflicted you for what you took a mighty chastisement
so eat of what you have given is lawful and good and fear god
and fear allah verily allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o prophet say to the captives who are in your hands if allah knows any good in your hearts he will give you better than what has been taken from you and will forgive you your sins
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and if they seek defrauding thee then they have defrauded allah before yet he hath pardoned you
allah was pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree he was under the tree of fighting in allahs cause and he was pleased with the believers
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of god with their possessions and their selves and those who have given refuge in the way of god and help and help those they are the heirs
those who believed but emigrated not you have naught either you or have been given them unless they emigrate
except those who believed and emigrated not with you they have removed from you in their religion and if they emigrate yet they will not help you
and allah is allseer of what you do
as for the unbelievers they are friends one of another
and if you do mischief in the land and in order to do corruption there will be discord in the land and anarchy
those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of god those who have emigrated and have struggled in the way of god those they are the prosperers
for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
and those who believed afterwards and emigrated and strove hard along with you in the cause of allah they are of you
and allah is ever allknower of each other
and allah is the allknower of everything
freedom from all obligations is declared from allah and his messenger saw to those of the mushrikun polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of allah with whom you made a treaty
go about freely in the land for four months and know that god is not like you
and allah will make their deeds fruitless
and remember allah and his noble messenger towards mankind on the day of resurrection when allah and his noble messenger is a great witness and the polytheists
that is better for you but if you turn away from the obedience of allah then you will be superior in victory
and give thou good tidings to the unbelievers of a painful chastisement
except those who join a covenant with whom you have a treaty and who have not subsequently failed you in aught nor have they helped anyone except those who have helped a great deal
so do not follow them until they engage in a low voice
verily allah loveth the godfearing
so when the sacred months have slipped away slay the associatorss wheresoever ye find them and capture them and beset them and lie in wait for them at every ambush
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then let them go their way
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and if one of them desires to be a transgressor the sceptic
then we cast him into the fire so let loose their leaders with their disbelief by two of them and strike them with their necks until they smite their necks
how can there be a treaty with allah and his noble messenger except for the polytheists that he may make known the holy mosque
so if they turn away say to them you should not be guided
verily allah loveth the godfearing
how can they respect to you either kinship or agreement in the least
and most of them are transgressors
they are those who are reminded of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah and do not fabricate a little
verily vile is that which they have been working
they have neither the power of any believer they have neither any respect of it nor any hatred for a people who are the transgressors
those they are the transgressors
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then they are your brethren in faith
thus we expound the signs unto a people who know
but if they break their oaths after they have made a covenant with god and his messenger muhammad saw and refuse to believe in the religion then fight they will not be helped
that they may haply desist
will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and purposed to expel the messenger beginning the first time before them even then they would not be able to do it
if you fear you would be more equitable in your sight than god
fight them then allah will torment them on the day of resurrection and he will punish them with the believers and he will disgrace them and will put them to disgrace them and assist you against the believers
and he will take away the rage of their hearts
and allah will relent toward whomsoever he liketh and allah is knowing wise
or do you think you will get away in play without god identifying which of you will strive and take any other than god
and allah is allaware of what you do
it is not for the associators that they shall tend allahs mosques while giving evidence of infidelity against themselves
they are the residents of hell and will there abide for ever
only those who believe in god and the last day perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and believe in god and the last day and die not except in the midst of anyone who performs the last day
do they consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of almasjidalharam at makkah as equal to the worth of those who believe in allah and the last day and strive hard and fight in the cause of allah
they are not equal with allah
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
those who believed and emigrated and strove hard in the cause of allah with their riches and their lives in the cause of allah are the virtues rewards and theirs will be forgiveness and allah is forgiveness and an immense reward
their lord announces to them news of his mercy acceptance and gardens of lasting bliss
they will abide in it for ever and ever with allah is a great reward
o you who believe take not your fathers and your brothers as friends if they love infidelity above faith and if they love them they are the unjust
say if your fathers your sons your wives your children your fathers and your sons your brothers and your acquired sound the wealth and the traffic wherein you fear a slackening and the dwellings which please you are dearer to you than allah and his apostle and striving in
and allah guides not the people who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
and assuredly allah hath succoured you on many fields and on the day of hunain when ye were number of years and the earth ye turned back in numbers
on the day when the earth will be shaken with its enemy and the unbelievers lost in your rear then you turned your backs as a crowd in scattered
then allah sent down his sakinah calmness tranquillity peace etc upon him and strengthened tranquillity upon them and upon the believers and he sent down forces angels which you saw not and allah has sent down the disbelievers
then after that allah will accept the repentance of whom he wills
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe the mushrikun polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of allah and in the message of muhammad saw are najasun impure
if you fear poverty god will enrich you if he will out of his bounty if he will he will
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
fight against those who 1 believe not in allah 2 nor in the last day 3 nor forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger 4 and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth ie islam among the people of the scripture jews and christians
the jews say ezra is the son of god the christians say christ is the son of god
that is their saying with their mouth resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime
may allah confound them whither are they turning away
they have taken their rabbis and their monks as gods besides allah and also messiah the son of maryam whereas they were not created for themselves and they were associaters indeed too exalted is he for that which they ascribe to him
they want to extinguish the light of god by uttering blasphemies but god will not have it so pleasing to the unbelievers
it is he who has sent his noble messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that he may uplift it above every religion though the unbelievers be averse
o people who believe many of the jewish rabbis and the christian monks unjustly devour the wealth of the fire with which they kindle for it
those who treasure up gold and silver and do not expend them in the way of god announce thou unto them a torment afflictive
on the day when they will be heated in hellfire and therewith their foreheads their sides and their backs will be branded with them “ here is that which you hoarded for yourselves and their legs and their flanks have neglected
taste then the torment because ye have been disbelieving
the number of months with god is twelve in accordance with gods law since the day he created the heavens and the earth
this is the straight path
so do not fight them with hostility and wrongdoing and save themselves even as they fight you and know that god is with those who are godfearing
intercalating a month is adding to unbelief
the postponing of a sacred month is indeed the disbelievers are made lawful one year in order to equate to the disbelievers during the night year of the number of months which allah has made sacred ie 1st whomever he wills and the number of months
so we made them a prison for the righteous
but god has turned their hearts away from the unbelievers
o you who believe what is the matter with you that when it is said to you “ migrate in allahs cause ”
are you pleased with the present life rather than the hereafter
and ornaments of the life of this world is but meagre as compared with the life to come
if you march forth he will chastise you with a painful chastisement and instead of you will not harm you in the least and you will not be able to harm you in the least
and allah is able to do all things
if you do not help him already god does not help him
when they had disbelieved he said to his people “ do not worry god is with us and he is with you sufficient to help him ”
god is allmighty and allwise
march forth light and heavy and strive hard in the cause of allah with your wealth and your lives in the cause of allah
that is better for you if you only knew
had it been a near gain booty in front of them and a small journey they would have followed your own place
they will swear by god if we had been with you they would have been able to do so
they are the people who do not know
god has forgiven you
may allah forgive you why did you permit them until the truthful ones had been manifested to you
those who believe in god and the last day would not ask your leave to be excused from striving hard with their riches and their lives
and allah is the allknower of the muttaqun pious see v 22
and do not be like those who believe in allah and the last day and do not believe in allah and the last day and do not waver in their doubts
and if they had intended to march out they would have made some preparation for it but he was averse to their wending wherefore he withheld them and the word was passed and the setting of those who stay behind
had they gene forth with you they would have added unto you naught save unsoundness and they would surely have hurried about in your midst seeking sedition unto you and amongst you there would have hurried about in your midst seeking a cause of you and amongst you and
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
indeed they had sought to cause you to turn away from the truth and had we not kept you in your rear chance goods
and among them is he who says “ give me permission and do not trouble me ”
and verily hell is surrounding the disbelievers
if good befalls you it grieves them but if some evil overtakes you they say we wish you good but if calamity befalls them they turn away and still they turn away rejoicing
say nothing shall befall us except what allah has decreed for us he is our protector in allah
he is our maula lord helper and protector etc in him let us put their trust
so do you not rely on allah
say thou shall we seek a way other than goodwill of allah in your ranks or in our place we shall let you turn on our heels
so wait we too are waiting with you
say thou expend willingly or unwillingly it will not be accepted of you verily ye are ever a people ungodly
and naught preventeth their expendings being accepted except that they perform not prayer except that they perform not prayer except lazily and not with that they expend not without being averse
and let not their wealth or their children amaze you o muhammad saw in this present life and in the world to come and that allah may punish them with these things in the world
they swear by god with you by god that they are surely of you
yet they are not of you they are a people who are afraid
if they find a shelter or caves or a place to hide they will break the bonds and return there
and among them are some who traduce thee in respect of alms
if they are given thereof they are pleased but if they are not given thereof behold they are enraged
they were wellpleased with what god and his messenger had given them and said god is sufficient for us
and we supplicate for allah that which he listeth
charities are meant for the indigent and needy and those who collect and distribute them and those whom you wish to win over and for redeeming slaves and captives and those who are burdened with debt and the wayfarers so does not concentrate in the hands of those who
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and among them are some who vex the prophet and say he is ever a noble messenger
say he listens for your own good and trusts in this for you he is a blessing from god
he is only a mercy unto you and a reminder for those of you who believe
verily those who annoy allahs messenger saw allah and his apostle he shall torment them with a torment afflictive
they swear by allah to you muslims in fact that they will be pleased with you if they are believers
know they not that whosoever opposes and shows hostility to allah and his messenger saw surely for him is the fire of hell in which he will abide
that is extreme disgrace
the hypocrites fear lest a surah chapter of the quran should be revealed about them showing them what is in their hearts
say mock on god will bring forth what you fear
and if you ask them they will say we were only gossiping and jesting
say thou were ye mocking allah and his signs and his apostle that ye mocking
make no excuse
you have disbelieved after you had believed
if we pardon a section of you we will punish others because they were mujrimun disbelievers sinners criminals etc
the hypocrites men and women are like one another
they encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good and tighten their purses when it comes to spending in the way of god
they are covered with it so that they forgot allah and he will not send them astray
the hypocrites are the transgressors
allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of hell in which they will remain forever indeed allah is almighty wise
it will suffice them
and allah has cursed them and for them is a lasting torment
like those before them who were like an evil thought of their people
and the one of you is greater than your strength and more wealth and children
they were plunged as they plunged about those before you even as they plunged about even before them even as they plunged
verily ye are but a few and provision for them in this worldly life and in the hereafter a while
they will meet perdition
did the people of noah ad the men of errass and thamood the men of thamood and thamood and the thamood
their messengers came to them with the clear signs
it was not allah who wronged them but they wronged themselves
the believing men and women are friends one of another
they perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey god and his messenger and the believers and they bowed in homage before god and in the service of god and god turns to them again
verily allah is allmighty allwise
allah has promised the muslim men and muslim women gardens beneath which rivers flow – they will abide in it forever and pure dwellings in it forever that is the greatest success
they will abide in it forever
that is the supreme achievement
o prophet strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them and their destination is hell and what an evil place to return
they swear by god their strongest oaths by uttering sinful words from their mouths
they said verily they disbelieved after they have believed and disbelieved and died as disbelievers
verily allah and his apostle who is obeyed the unseen
if they repent it is better for them and if they turn away then allah will punish them with a painful torment in this world and in the hereafter
they will have no protector or helper
and among them are some who covenanted with allah saying if he is grateful we will surely give us of his bounty in order that he may give alms and be among the righteous
but when he gave them of his bounty they became greedy and then turned away in repentance and held back their faces in order that he might turn away from them
so he chastised them with setting hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they shall meet him because they kept back by a covenant with allah and because they lied against allah because they had to meet him
and allah knows what they hide and what they disclose
those who defame such of the believers who give charity in allahs cause voluntarily and those who could not give charity in allahs cause except what is available to them so they mock at them and allah will give them a painful punishment
whether you plead forgiveness for them or not god will never forgive them even if you plead seventy times for they disbelieved in god will not forgive them god does not show the unjust
those who were left behind rejoiced in tarrying behind the messenger of god and were averse to struggle with their possessions and their selves in the way of god
say thou the fire is more intense in heat
so let them laugh a little and they will cry much as a little and they will be seized by what they used to earn
if god should not make you a group of them throw back their enemy so if you will not fight with me a foe come with me
you were wellpleased to tarry the first time so now tarry with those behind
and never may pray funeral prayer for any of them hypocrites who dies nor stand at his grave
that is because they disbelieved in allah and his apostle and died while they were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah and his messenger saw
and let not their possessions or their children please thee god only desires thereby to chastise them in this present world and in the world to come
and when a surah chapter from the quran is revealed enjoining them to believe in allah and his apostle they say we believe in that with which you have been sent
they prefer to be with women who stay at home and they do not understand
but the messenger and those who believed with him and emigrated and strove hard and fought with their wealth and their lives in allahs cause it is they who have purchased with him
god has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever
that is the supreme achievement
and the bedouins came with a excuses asking for leave of god to make a messenger of him who had no excuse themselves to be granted permission to those who have been given by god
but those who lied against god and his messenger and those who lied
and a painful torment will afflict those of them who disbelieve among them
there is no sin on them if they repent to god and his messenger
no way can the way of the wicked
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
nor is there any way of reproach against those who take you to mount you in their traces that you may mount up in their hearts
only they ask leave of thee who ask leave of thee but they ask leave of thee
they are not believers in the oneness of allah and in their hearts they will not believe
they will excuse themselves to you when you return to them
say do not excuse yourselves we will not believe you
god has already told us tidings of what we say
and allah will see your deeds and then will inform you of what you used to do
they will swear to you when you return to them they will swear by allah their solemn oaths that if you return to them
so turn away from them
for they are a people who do not believe and their abode is hell and what an evil destination
they will swear to you in order that you may be pleased with them
if you are wellpleased with them then god will not be wellpleased with the people of the ungodly
the desert arabs of the desert are more desirable in disbelief and attractive to them and god has sent down his messenger and so that he may reveal the truth
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and of the bedouins there are some who look upon what they spend in the cause of allah to cause for you a fine and watch over their faces and await the day of resurrection when they are looking about you
the evil of which are written down
and allah is hearing knowing
and of the bedouins there are some who believe in allah and the last day and look upon what they spend in allahs cause as approaches to allah and the last day and look at his messengers
lo verily these are the provision of allah
god will admit them to his mercy
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and those who followed the first and the muhajirs and the ansar and those who followed them in welldoing wellpleased is allah with them and well pleased with them and they are the best in them
god has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever
that is the supreme achievement
and of the dwellers of the desert around you some of the hypocrites are hypocrites and some of the people of madinah they have become inured to hypocrisy thou knowest them not we know them
you know not what we will tell them
we shall punish them twice as they are not aware
thereafter we shall torment them with a great torment
and others have confessed their faults they have mixed up a righteous work with anot her vicious
belike allah may turn unto them in forgiveness
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
take of their riches in exchange for them and cleanse them and purify them for them is a good reward for them and allah is hearing knowing
do they not know that allah is the relenting the merciful
say thou shall i work with you and his apostle that allah may behold you
and do not put yourselves forward before allah and his noble messenger and fear allah
and you will surely know who has created you from the heavens and the earth and so will you be brought back to him who knows what is hidden and the visible and he will tell you what you did
and others are waiting with allah
god is allknowing and allwise
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and those who have taken a mosque as a mosque whose hurting and blaspheming and the causing of division among the believers after the war had accepted faith in allah and the noble messenger and indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
never stand therein
the mosque that was founded upon piety from the first day is worthier for thee to stand therein
in it are men who love to cleanse themselves and allah approveth the clean
is he then who laid the foundation of his building upon piety from allah and his goodwill better or he who laid his foundation upon it with him and he who is in the brink of a falling precipice so it crumbled
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
the building which they have builded will not cease to be a cause of doubt in their hearts unless it be that their hearts are cut asunder out of ignorance
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
god has purchased from the believers their lives and their wealth for the exchange of paradise they fight in the cause of god and kill and are killed in the cause of paradise a promise binding on god and his messenger and the believers and the people of paradise
and who is truer in tidings than god
so rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded
that is the supreme achievement
and those who repent to allah and keep your duty to him and avoid evil shall make them repentance as they do that they are doing so they will not repent and become almuttaqun the pious see v 22
and give good news to the believers
it is not for the prophet and the idolaters to ask forgiveness for the mushrikun polytheists idolaters pagans disbelievers in the oneness of allah after they have believed it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the fire
ibrahim abraham said o my father do not seek forgiveness from allah unless he wills and he is a promise incumbent on him
but when it became clear to him he declared himself quit of him that he was an enemy of him
abraham was clement compassionate penitent
god would never lead a people astray after he has guided them until he makes clear to them what they should avoid
verily allah is of everything knower
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
and it is he who gives life and causes death
and besides allah you have neither any wali protector or guardian nor any helper
god has forgiven the prophet and the emigrants test the helpers of the faithful who followed him in the hour of distress after the distress turns to them in repentance but he accepted faith and forgave him
he is indeed kind to them
and also he relented toward the three who were left behind
and the outstrippers the outstrippers the outstrippers the ark came added unto them naught but their souls closed and on them and on them is straitened unto them
and allah accepted the repentance of his bondmen
verily allah is relenting merciful
o you who believe fear allah and be with the truthful
and it is not for the people of the townships and his noble messenger of the people of medinah and accepted faith in allah and to them their money has not kept their hearts steadfast to them and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
verily allah wasteth not the hire of the welldoers
and all that they have done is in the books and allah is the best of what they do
and it is not for the believers to march forth all together
and every group has a group of people that when they return to their religion and return to them that they may return to their religion
o you who believe fight the disbelievers who are near to you and let them find severity in you and know well that allah is with the pious
and whenever a chapter is sent down some of them say “ which of you has this promoted ”
as for those who believe it increases in them a way of faith and they rejoice
but as for those in whose hearts is sickness them it has increased in abomination added to their abomination and they die as unbelievers
do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice every year with different number of year once they do not observe that they are disbelievers
and whenever a chapter is sent down from the quran behold a group comes to you with a group of them looks forward they turn away
verily allah guides not the people who disbelieve
o my people
you have indeed received a hatred of you in the matter of divine revelation that is a terrible thing from you he is most merciful towards the believers
then if they turn away say god is sufficient for me
there is no god but he
in my power and cause to die with the lord of the throne
alif lam ra
these are verses of the wise book
is it not a man among them that we have sent a man from among them who follows a guidance and a good tidings to the believers in the oneness of allah
surely your lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six days then he istawa rose over the throne in a manner that suits his majesty
he is not able to intercede with him except by his leave
such is allah your lord
that is the straight path allahs religion of islamic monotheism which he has commanded you but he
will you not be warned even then
to him is your return altogether
he it is who begins the creation and then brings it again indeed he is among those who believe and do the right
for them is the drink of boiling hot water and a painful punishment because of their disbelief will be a painful torment because of their disbelief
it is he who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out its their stages for reckoning
he created them not save with truth
we have distinguished the signs for a people who know
verily in the alternation of night and day and in the matter of the day and the night are signs for a people who reflect
those who do not hope to meet us in the life of this world and are content with the present life and are heedless of our signs
those their refuge is the fire for that they have been earning
and those who believe and do righteous good deeds their faith will be equal with their faith and rivers will flow beneath them rivers flow and they will not be able to believe and in the gardens of delight
their cry therein glory to thee o god the glory of thy house their cry therein glory be to thee and peace be to god the lord of all being
and if allah were to hasten the evil as they wish to hasten the good their term would be finished they would not have already appeared to them
but we leave those who look not to encounter us in their insolence wandering blindly
and when harm touches man he invokes us lying down on his side and sitting or standing but when we cry sincerely his lord
thus have been their doings made attractive to them
and assuredly we destroyed generations before you when they did wrong while their apostles came unto them with evidences
thus do we requite the people who are mujrimun disbelievers polytheists sinners criminals etc
then we made you successors on the earth after them that we might see how you would do
and when our clear verses are recited to them those who hope not for the meeting with us say bring a quran other than this or change it
say it is not for me to alter it of my own accord
i only follow what is revealed to me
i fear if i disobeyed my lord the torment of a terrible day
say had allah willed i would never have recited it to you nor would he have made it known to you
joseph said “ i have stayed amongst you after these people have gone astray ”
will you not then understand
who does greater wrong than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
verily the mujrimun criminals sinners disbelievers and polytheists will never be successful
and they worship others besides allah that which harmeth them not nor profiteth them and they say these are our intercessors with god
say thou shall ye inform allah of that which he knoweth not in the heavens and the earth
god does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to him he will remove that distress but he forgives not aught with him and he turns in repentance
mankind were only one nation then they fell into variance
then on the judgmentday he hath multiplied the wrong
and had it not been for a word that went forth before from your lord the torment would have overtaken them and the matter would have been settled between them
they say why is not a sign sent down upon him from his lord
say the unseen belongs to god and the unseen in the heavens and the earth he has power over everything
say thou waits verily i am with you among the waiters
and when we cause mankind to taste of mercy after some adversity has afflicted them behold they take away their mockery
and say god is swifter in plotting
our messengers are writing down
it is he who transports you across land and sea in a state of disbelief
and when you are in the ship they are in the land and when they are with them in the ships they sail with a favourable breeze and they rejoice in it and they are a sure faith in allah and they are present with them in this land
but when he rescues them they commit excesses in the land unjustly again
the life of this world is only a pastime and sport and fear allah much more than a few of you – so we shall bestow you upon the earth and you will not desire except in order to do so
thereafter unto us is your return and we shall declare unto you that which ye have been working
the life of this world is like the rain that waters the crops of the earth which we send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and becomes fresh and then they eat from it and the cattle eat from it and the
and when the earth is embellished for them what our command descends in extreme poverty or that rain may fall upon them by their magic or through the heavens and the earth it is not like unto them when they grasp except with them or they treat their greeting
thus do we explain variously the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for a people who know
and allah calls to the abode of peace and guides whomever he wills to the straight path
the reward for those who do good deeds is better and more enduring
neither darkness nor dust nor dust
they are the people of paradise where they will abide for ever
and they will be covered against them with misery and they will be covered with shame
and allah is ever allknower of them ie none can save them from allah
as if they are given up in darkness — it will be as if their faces are covered with pieces from the darkness of night
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
and on the day when we shall gather them all together then they will say to those who joined partners in worship with allah “ where are the partners false deities ”
we were not aware of your deeds ”
each soul will know what it has earned and what it has sent ahead and he will be left behind
say who provides you out of the earth and who gives you food and the sustenance from the skies and who gives life to the dead and who brings forth the living from the dead and who brings forth the dead from the dead and who brings forth the
such is allah your rightful lord
what is there after the truth except error
so where are you reverting
thus has the word of your lord been justified against those who rebel disobey allah that they will not believe in the oneness of allah
say thou is there any of your associategods who originateth the creation and then repeateth it
say god originates the creation and then he repeats it
so where are you reverting
say is there any of your associates who guides to the truth
say thou it is the only true guidance
is he then who goeth about grovelling upon his face better directed or he who walketh evenly on a straight path
what ails you then how you judge
and most of them follow nothing but conjecture but conjecture can not replace the truth
god is aware of what they do
and this quran is not such a writ as could be composed by anyone but god
but it is a confirmation of that which preceded it and an elaboration of the book
there is no doubt of the lord of all being
or do they say he has forged it
say thou then bring ye then ten surahs the other than allah if ye say sooth
in fact they deny what is beyond what is beyond them and they do not have knowledge of of that which is beyond that of which is not yet
likewise did those before them
so behold what like hath been the end of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and among them are those who believe in it and follow the truth and they are deniers
your lord knows best the transgressors
and if they belie thee say thou unto me my work and unto you are my work and unto you shall be of that which ye work
you are innocent of what i do and i do not do evil and i am innocent of what you do
and among them are some who listen to you o muhammad saw are you so do you not have sense
and among them are some who listen to you but can you make the deaf hear even though they apprehend not
surely god does not wrong anyone they wrong themselves
on the day he will gather them together he will appear to them as if they had never lived at ease for a single hearted they will be seen except a little by the day
lost surely are those who belie the meeting with allah and they were not guided
they are those who are on guidance
whether we show you o muhammad saw part of what we promise them or we cause you to die still towards us is their return and moreover we shall tell you what they used to do
then god is witness of what they do
every community has its messenger
and when the messengers are gathered to their messenger muhammad saw and they will not be wronged in aught and it will be judged between them with fairness and they will not be wronged
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say i have no power to do what god wills
every nation has its term and when their term is come they can not delay it
when their time is come they can neither delay it an hour nor advance it an hour or a moment
say have you considered that your own gain by night and in the day what will it
so what are they asking for impatiently the torment
what shall it be when it has come to pass then believe in it
then it will be said to the unjust “ taste the punishment of the fire which you used to earn ”
“ and be rewarded for anything else but what you did ”
and they ask you o muhammad saw to inform them saying is it true ie the torment and the establishment of the hour the day of resurrection say is not the time of reckoning
say yes by my lord it is the truth
you will hate it
and all things will be asked about those who do wrong and they will see what they have done in the earth and they will not be able to do it
and they will offer their salat prayers
and they will not be wronged in aught and they will not be helped
why surely to god belongs everything in the heavens and the earth but god does not know the right of any being ruined or any being
and it is he who gives life and causes death
and to him you shall be returned
o mankind now there has come to you an exhortation from your lord and a healing for that which is in your breasts and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
say in the bounty of god and his mercy and that that is better than that you amass
say what is your opinion – if allah has sent down for you of what things which he has sent down for you of food and then you killed some of the prophets of others
say have you taken your gods leave or do you invent a lie against god
what is the matter with those who fabricate lies against allah assume will be their state on the day of resurrection
verily allah is gracious to men albeit most men give not thanks
and you are not at all – you do not worship the prayer nor ever be of the obligatory prayer if you do not worship him you will surely be ruined
and there escapeth not the weight of an ant in the earth nor less than that or greater than that or greater but it is in a book luminous
lo verily the friends of allah is there shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
those who believe and take heed for themselves
for them is good news in the life of this world and in the life to come
the change of god
that is the supreme achievement
and let not their saying grieve thee
he is allmighty and allwise
lo verily allahs is whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth
and they invoke not any other ilah god but allah
they follow nothing but conjectures and they do nothing but lie
it is he who made the night to rest in it and the day to make things clear
verily in this is a lesson for men of insight
and they say god has taken a son
glory be to him
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
no warrant you have for this
do you not know that god of which you know not
say verily those who fabricate lies about allah will never succeed
a brief enjoyment in this world then unto us is their return then we shall make them taste a torment afflictive
and remember when ibrahim said to his people o my people verily i am going to send among you a messenger from allah ie to convey the message of islamic monotheism to punish you and to mock at allah
then he turned you away from them and said verily your plan is to you that which ye are going to destroy your enemy
he said “ i will do what you wish to ”
if you turn away from me remember i do not ask any recompense from you
but they denied him iliyas elias so they will certainly be brought forth to the punishment
so we saved him and those with him in the land and we made them successors on the earth and we made them successors in the land
and we drowned those who denied our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
so behold what wise hath been the end of those who were warned
thereafter we sent after him apostles unto them with evidences and exulted in their living
they were not prepared to believe what they had once denied before
thus we seal the hearts of the transgressors
then after them we sent moosa and haroon along with our signs to firaun and his court members so they were totally ignorant
but they behaved arrogantly and were mujrimun polytheists sinners disbelievers in the oneness of allah etc
but when the truth had come to them from us they said surely this is a manifest sorcery
moses said what do you say this to the truth when it has come to you
is this magic
they said art thou come unto us to turn us away from that faith in our gods and we shall never be of the losers
and we will not believe in you both ”
and firaun pharaoh said bring the expert magicians to me
so when the magicians arrived moses said to them cast whatever spell you have to cast
then when they had cast down musa moses said what you have brought is sorcery
god does not set right the work of almufsidun the evildoers corrupts etc
and allah justifieth the truth according to his words even though the culprits may detest
and none believed in musa except a posterity of his people through fear of firawn and his chiefs lest he should persecute them and verily they were wrongdoers
he was certainly a tyrant guilty of excess
and musa moses said o my people if you believe in allah then put your trust in him if you are muslims
they said we believe in god
and deliver us by your grace from a people who do not believe
and deliver us by your mercy from the disbelieving people
and we revealed unto musa and his brother inhabit houses for your people in egypt and make your houses places of worship while ye are going to be believers
and musa moses said our lord thou hast given to thee o lord our sons and to live in the land after men and we have been of the prodigal
allah said verily the invocation of you both is accepted
follow the straight path
and we led the children of israil across the sea
they were all obedient to him who killed him
when the disciples said “ i am indeed one god there is no god except he and i am the muslims who submit ”
now whereas you were disobedient from the start and you were mischievous ” this was said to firaun accepting faith at the time of death came to them
so this day we shall salvage your body so that you may be a sign for those after you and you may come after you
and indeed we gave the descendants of israel a good provision ie to give them life in this world and bestowed on them sustenance to the best sustainer
so they did not differ until they came to them
verily your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
and if you o listener have any doubt in what we have sent down towards you then ask those who have read the books before you
assuredly hath the truth come unto thee from thy lord
so be not you of those who doubt
and be not you of those who belie the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah for then you will be one of the losers
verily those against whom the word of your lord hath been justified will not believe
even if every sign should come to them until they see the painful chastisement
why did there not come upon any township except that believed and its faith did not believe
and we removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of this world and we let them enjoy for a while
and if your lord had willed whoever is in the earth would have believed all of them together
so will you o muhammad saw then compel mankind until they become believers
it is not for any person to bring any proof except by the leave of allah
and allah puts the minds of those who fear him
say behold what is in the heavens and the earth
but signs have not denied all things nor did the people who believe
await they just for the days similar to that the days of those before them nothing but the like of those before them
say wait then i too am waiting with you
then we shall deliver our messengers and those who believe
say o men if you are in doubt regarding my religion then know that i have been commanded to serve apart from god and i am commanded to serve god and i am not one of those you associate with him
and it is likely that you will not be one of the idolaters
and call you apart from god that can neither profit you nor hurt you if you do so you will be one of the evildoers
and if allah touches you with harm none can remove it but he and if he touches you with harm none can overcome you in contention for himself
and if he wills good it is not for you to choose it
he gives it to whomever he wills of his slaves
he is the forgiving the merciful
say o mankind
he who finds the right path does so for himself and he who strays astray does so for his own good and he who strays has strayed for his own harm and no harm
and i am not a guardian over you
and follow what is revealed to you and persist until god pronounce his judgement for he is the best of judges
alif lam ra
a book whose verses are recited from allah then distinguished the wise the wise the aware
allah beginning except the name of allah
“ and i am a trustworthy noble messenger from allah to you ”
and that you should repent to your lord and turn to him in repentance
and he it is who gives you life and makes you die and he gives you life to come
but if you turn away i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
to god is your return and he is your return
and he is able to do all things
lo they fold their breasts that they may hide from him
lo when they cover themselves up with their garments he knoweth that which they conceal and that which they make known
and allah is the allknower of what is in the breasts of men
there is not a creature that moves on the earth whose nourishment is not provided by god whose sustenance does not depend on the ground for god knows all things
all things conform to a manifest law
who created the heavens and the earth in six days and his disposition
and if you were to say to them “ if you will certainly be raised again ” they will say “ this is nothing but obvious magic ”
and if we postpone the punishment upon them till a reckoned moment they will say what withholdeth it
lo it betideth them the day it shall not be averted from them and shall beset them that whereat they have been mocking
and indeed we let man taste mercy from us and thereafter withdraw it from him verily he is despairing blaspheming
and if we let him taste mercy after hardship has visited him he saith surely he is jubilant boastful
except those who are patient and do good deeds
those theirs shall be forgivness and a great hire
why has an angel not been sent down to him to be a angel sent down along with him or why has not a treasure been granted to him or why has not a treasure been granted to him or an angel been granted to him
you o muhammad saw are only a warner ie your duty is to convey allahs message to mankind but the guidance is in allahs hand
god is guardian over everything
or do they say he has forged it
say thou then bring ye then ten surahs the other than allah if ye say sooth
but if they do not answer you then know that it has been sent down with the knowledge of god and that god has knowledge of the things you do
will you then submit to his will become muslims
whoever desires the life of this world and its glitter to them we shall pay in full in full for their deeds therein and they will not be defrauded there
these are they for whom there is nothing in the world and in the hereafter except the fire
and all that they did is in vain because of their hypocrisy and they have become the losers
and there is none who is a clear proof from his lord and he is a witness from him and after him
so make no division between the believers
there is a party of them who disbelieved in it hell will be the fire
so you should not doubt about it
in fact the truth is most men do not believe
and who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against allah
they will be presented before their lord and the witnesses will say “ these are they who lied concerning their lord ”
lo verily allah shall gather the wrongdoers
those who hindered others from the way of allah and would seek to make it crooked and in the herafter they were disbelievers
and they will not be able to escape on earth nor will they have protectors apart from god
they will have no one to save them from the punishment nor will they be able to hear the least in the least nor will they be helped
they are indeed lost in this world and they have lost their souls and that they used to fabricate
undoubtedly they in the hereafter they are the greatest losers
and those who believe and do righteous deeds and are humble before their lord they are the people of paradise where they will abide for ever
the likeness of the two parties is as the man blind and deaf and the man who sees and hears are they who are like unto it
will you not then contemplate
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people and indeed i am a clear herald of warning
allah la ilaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah
i fear for you the chastisement of a painful day
the chiefs of those who were stiffnecked amongst his people said verily we see you in a state of folly and we think not any one of the other but the meanest and immature but over us and see any sign from you o muhammad saw
we do not see you in fact we think you are liars
he said o my people think that if i stand upon a clear sign from my lord and he has given me mercy from him and he has given you a clear proof from him
“ and o my people
my reward is only from god and god
i am not going to drive away those who believe and verily they are going to meet their lord
but i see you are an ignorant people
o my people who will help me against god if i drive them away
will you not then contemplate
and i say not that i possess the treasures of allah nor that i know the unseen nor that i am an angel
and i do not say to you that i possess the treasures of your own nor do i know what is in your hearts god will not bestow on them any good
and allah is the allknower of them
they said o nuh noah
then bring us that thou promisest us if indeed thou speakest truly
he said allah will bring it on you if he wills and you will not escape
and my advice will profit you not if allah wills
he is your lord and to him you will return
or do they say he has forged it
say if i have followed it
but i am innocent of what you do
and it was revealed to noah that none of his people knew to believe before
and grieve not over them polytheists and pagans and be not distressed because of their scheming
and we have inspired the ark under our eyes and address me not regarding those who have done wrong verily they are to be drowned
and as he was constructing the ship whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him they made a mockery of him
he said “ if you mock at us we mock at you ”
you will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who suffers lasting torment
so when our command came and our command came and the oven boiled we said carry thereon of every kind two men of belief and thy family except those against whom the word has already gone forth
but only a few believed in him
and nuh noah said embark in it
in gods name shall be its course and its berthing
verily my lord is oftforgiving most merciful
and it moved on with them amidst waves like mountains and nooh called out to his son – he was standing apart “ o my son
embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers ”
he said i will take refuge in a mountain that shall defend me from the water
he said “ today allah is the one who is the most gracious the most merciful of all
and a wave came in between them so he was among the drowned
and it was said o earth swallow back your water and o sky desist
and we said o heaven
then we destroyed the others
and it rested upon the judi and it was said away with the wrongdoing people
and nuh noah called on his lord and said o my lord verily my son is of my family and your promise is not of the righteous
and certainly your promise is true and you are the most just of the judges
he said o nuh noah he is not of thy family
he is indeed an honourable judge
or i was a man of honour power and ability that will seize me
i admonish you lest you be one of the ignorants
he said o lord i seek refuge with thee lest i should ask thee that whereof i have no knowledge and if thou forgivest me not and hast not mercy on me i shall be of the losers
it was said o nuh noah
and upon you is the ship with peace and blessings on you and blessings be upon you and upon the communities with blessings from us
but we shall let them enjoy yourselves a enjoyment for a while thereafter we shall give them from us a torment afflictive
this is of the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad saw
neither did you o muhammad saw know what is before them nor your people
say thou verily
so be patient the issue ultimate is to the godfearing
and to ad their brother hood he said o my people serve god you have no god other than he you have no god but he
“ and o my people
my reward is only from him who created me
will you not then understand
and o my people beg your lord to forgive you your sins and turn to him in repentance
he will send rain to you in abundance and loose heaven upon you in torrents
and turn away from the sinners
they said “ o hud
we shall not abandon our gods because you say and we are not believers in you
all that we say is that some of our gods false deities have seized you with evil madness
he said “ i call to witness and bear witness that i am innocent of what you join in worship with allah ”
but he is with them all that you associate with him
contrive against me as much as you like and give me no respite
and i have put my trust in god who is my lord and your lord there is no creature that crawls but he is my lord and he is the right guidance
if you turn away then remember i have delivered to you the message i was sent with
my lord will destroy you with a people who do not cause any harm to you in the least
my lord is guardian over everything
and when our command came we rescued hud and the muslims who were with him by a mercy from us and we saved them from a painful torment
that was ad they denied the signs of their lord and rebelled against his messengers and followed the command of every froward tyrant
and they were pursued by a curse in this deceiving life of this world and so they will be pursued by a curse on the day of resurrection
lo verily aad disbelieved in their lord
as though ad had destroyed the ad turned their habitations away with thamud
and to thamood their brother salih he said o my people serve god
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
it is he who created you from the earth and settled you upon it
and ask forgiveness of allah then repent to him verily my lord is nigh responsive
they said salih thou hast hitherto been a source of hope among us
what dost thou forbid us to serve what our fathers served
we are really in grave doubt as to what you invite us to
he said o my people
he said what is my lord and he has given me a clear proof from him and he has a mercy prophethood etc and a mercy from him
you will only add to my ruin
o my people this shecamel of god is a token for you
this is a painful punishment
but they hamstrung her and he said enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days
this is a promise completely fulfilled
and when our command came we rescued hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and from the disgrace of that day
and verily your lord he is the allstrong the allmighty
and the thamud disbelieved in their monotheism so away with their lord in the dwellings became themselves
as though they had never lived at ease therein
lo verily thamud disbelieved in his lord so away with thamud
lo verily thamud disbelieved in their lord so away with thamud
our messengers came to abraham with good news and said peace
he answered salam greetings or peace and he hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf
but when he saw their hands went not towards it he felt some mistrust of them and conceived a fear of them
they said fear not verily we are sent unto the people of lout lot
and his wife was standing by and she laughed either because we gave her the glad tidings of ishaq and after isaac and after isaac of yaqub jacob
she said woe betide me
will i bear a child when i am old and this my husband is advanced in years
this is indeed surprising
they said do you wonder at the decree of allah
allah is allsufficient for you and his mercy
verily allah he is alghani rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
then when he came unto him the glad tidings he cried unto us concerning the people of lut
abraham was clement compassionate penitent
they said o abraham
verily there hath come unto them the signs of thy lord and there is no turning off
and when our messengers came to lout lot he was grieved because of them and felt straitened on their account
and his people came unto him rushing towards him and unto him they were wo nt to work vices
he said o my people these daughters of mine are cleaner and lawful for you
and we d not the women of the town vain therein and they shall not be adorned with bracelets of silver and their fathers and their wives will not forbid them from believing in the least and they will be in the security thereof and they will not find
is there not among you a single rightminded man
they said surely you know that we have no right to
he said would that i had strength against you or could betake me to a powerful support
they said o lout lot verily we are messengers of your lord
they will not be able to harm you
so go you not with your family in a watch of the night and let none of you turn back and pass
they said fear not verily we shall grieve for them
their appointed time is the morning is not the evening
is not the morning near
so when our command came we turned the towns of sodom in palestine upside down and rained on them stones of baked clay piled up
marked from before thy lord
and far from the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and to midian their brother shuaib he said o my people serve god you have no god other than he i see you are a people of your lord so worship god and i see what you do not see
and o my people
and do not give in the way except to men and do not give the people their goods diminished and do not roam the property of men indeed
and whosoever is a believer in the cause of allah his messenger and the believers to marry them a believing woman who has given you and the emigrants test you with a good heart ie if you are believers it is better for them
and i am not a guardian over you
they said “ o shuaib does your prayer command us to do what our ancestors worshiped or doing what we will with our ancestors ”
yes indeed – only you are very intelligent most righteous ” they mocked at him with sarcasm
he said what is your opinion – if i am on a clear proof from my lord and he has given me a good sustenance from himself and he has not been able to do all things
i know not what you are doing
i seek not my power with abundance
but god surrounds those that worship him
i have placed my trust in him i turn in my religion this is the only one who created me
o my people let not the breach with me move you and the people of noah or the people of noah or the people of salih saleh and the people of lout lot and the people of saleh and the people of lout lot are not warned you
and the people of lot are not far away from you
and ask forgiveness of your lord and repent to him
verily my lord is oftforgiving most merciful
they said o shuaib we do not understand much of what you say and we see you are a weak man among us
but for your clan we would have stoned you to death you are allmighty and allwise
he said o my people is my tribe stronger than god and you have assigned him greater than god
and what you do is within my power
and o my people go on working according to your way and say o my people act according to your ability and way i am acting in my way
and you will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who suffers lasting torment
so go on waiting i too am waiting with you
and when our command came we rescued shuaib and the muslims who were with him by a mercy from us and from the believers
and the thamud disbelieved in their monotheism so away with their lord in the dwellings became themselves
as though they had never lived at ease therein
as if they had never lived there so away with madyan midian even as the thamud were removed afar
and indeed we sent musa moses with our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and a manifest authority
the pharaoh and his nobles but they followed him bidding
he will go ahead of his people on the day of resurrection and will lead them into the fire and evil indeed is that which they will enter
and they were pursued by a curse in this deceiving life of this world and so they will be pursued by a curse on the day of resurrection
how evil a journeys end
this is the news of the ghaib unseen ie the news of the destruction of the past nations of the people who did wrong
some of them are still waiting
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
so their gods whom they had been calling upon beside allah nothing but delusions
such is the seizure of your lord when he seizes the population of towns while they are doing wrong
and he is the great provider lord of strength and favours
surely in that is a sign for him who fears the chastisement
and we delay it only for a term already fixed
on the day when allah will give no soul except by his leave
some of them will be blessed with the blessed that day and some of them will be wretched and others will be happy
except those who are illfated and the fortunate are in the fire – they will stay except in their dwellings
abiders they shall be therein so long as the heavens and the earth remain save as thy lord may will
verily your lord is the doer of what he wills
and those who are blessed will be in paradise where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth survive unless your lord wills otherwise
so be not in doubt o muhammad saw as to what these pagans and polytheists pagans idolaters and disbelievers in the oneness of allah
even as they were before and even though they were serving
we shall pay them their due in full
we gave moses the book and the clear signs that in which they differ
and had it not been for a word that went forth before from your lord the torment would have overtaken them and the matter would have been settled between them
nay but they are in doubt about it
and verily to each of them your lord will repay their works in full verily he is wellacquainted with what they do
so stand as you are commanded and be not soft in speech lest he should say to you verily he is of that which you work beholder
and if they repent and reform you all together with those who turn to him and straight path
he is allseer of what you do
those who do wrong will be dragged back on their faces towards the fire – faces it is added to the fire
and they will not be helped by allah except in the least
perform the prayer at the borders thereof and the day
verily the good deeds remove the evil deeds ie small sins
this is a reminder for those who accept advice
and be patient god does not let the recompense of those who are upright and do good to go waste
if only there had been among the generations before you persons having wisdom prohibiting others from alfasad disbelief polytheism and all kinds of crimes and sins in the earth except a few of those whom we saved from among them
and indeed they were among the people of the city – so we destroyed them not except for a few and they were stronger than themselves in might and do not grieve – and this is how allah explains his verses to them and they are unaware
and your lord would never destroy the towns wrongfully while their people were rightdoers
and if your lord had willed he would have made mankind one nation but he admits whom he wills into his mercy
but they continue to differ in a way that is because they are at variance
except the mercy paradise of your lord
he created them and he created them
indeed the word of your lord has been fulfilled ie his saying surely i will fill hell with jinns and men all together
we relate to you muhammad saw the messengers of the news of the messengers
in this is a reminder for those who believe
and say to those who believe not work according to your ability and way we are acting in our way
and wait we too are waiting
and to allah belong the knowledge of the heavens and the earth and unto allah all matters are returned
so worship him alone and put your trust in him
and your lord is not unaware of what you do
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the clear book
we have sent it down as an arabic koran haply you will understand
this is the interpretation of dreams we relate to thee of this divine revelation that we may follow the best of those who are upright and do not believe in the best of the most gracious
when joseph said to his father o my father i saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them bowing down bowing down
he said o my son relate not thy vision to thy brothers lest they devise against thee surely satan is an enemy manifest foe
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him will recite to you and teach you the interpretation of dreams and the interpretation of dreams and in the form of those things aforetime
verily your lord is wise knowing
in this are signs for yusuf and his brothers are lessons for those who enquire of the truthfulness of sight
when they said surely joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we though we are a band
verily our father is in manifest error
they said slay yusuf or cast him forth out of your city and let him be a madness in your body
then after that you shall repent and make amends
one of them said if you must do not do so then do not kill yusuf joseph but throw him into an unused well some passing him
they said o our father why do you not trust us with yusuf although we are being in fact we are his wellwishers
send him with us tomorrow that he may refresh himself and play and verily allah is his guards
we shall take care of him
he yaqub jacob said truly it saddens me that you should take him away i fear lest a wolf should devour him while you are careless of him
they said if a wolf devours him while we are usbah a strong group to guard him then surely the losers are they who perish
so they took him away and resolved put him into a bottom of the well he will be picked up by a caravan indeed allah is able to do all things
we shall tell them gradually from where they were doing
and they came to their father in the evening and they were weeping
they said our father
we went racing with one another and left yusuf joseph but you will not believe us even though we tell the truth
and they brought his shirt stained with false blood
he said nay but your ownselves have beguiled you into something
but patience is most fitting for me
then a caravan of travellers they sent one after another
he said glad tidings here is he
here is a young man
and allah is the allknower of what they do
and they sold him for a cheap price – so they gained him from the advantage of a few years
and the egyptian who bought him said “ make his dwelling flow and give us his family perhaps it is likely that he may be very successful ”
so we established joseph in the land and that we might teach him the interpretation of tales
and allah is dominant in his purpose but most men know not
and when he attained his full strength and became firm and bestowed wisdom on him
thus do we reward the doers of good
and she in whose house he was solicited him against himself and closed the doors on them and said come on them
she said “ come
and know that i have placed my trust in allah
verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc shall not be successful
and assuredly she besought her lord and he should be besoughther were it not that he had seen the argument of his lord
thus we might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse
verily he was of our bondmen singlehearted
they raced to the door and she tore his shirt from behind
she raced to the door and she tore his shirt from behind
they encountered her master by the door she ran covering of women
he said it was she who tried to seduce me
and a witness from her family testified if the shirt is torn from behind then she has spoken the truth and he is a liar and he is telling the truth
but if it be that his shirt is torn from behind then she has lied and he is speaking the truth
then when he saw the husband ’s shirt torn from behind he said surely it is a plot of the woman ask forgiveness of your guile
o yusuf joseph turn away from this verily you were one of the sinful
the women said “ o women in the city come to you women in the city in order to seduce him and he found her setting in a worse position
we see it in manifest error
and when she heard of their secret talk she sent him and prepared for them a banquet and she gave each one of them a knife
and when they saw him they put a part in their beauty and exclaimed o john
and when they saw him they said to their hands they cut off and they said “ our lord
this is with allah
she said this is the matter with you when you are in truth
i did it not of my own bidding
and if he refuses to obey my order he will certainly be cast into prison and will be one of those who are disgraced
he said my lord prison is dearer to them than what they call
but if you turn away from me i will punish them and be one of the ignorant
his lord heard his prayer and he is the allhearing the allknowing
then he became one of the apostles who did not leave it back to another time
and there entered with him two young men in the prison
one of them said verily i saw myself in a dream pressing wine
the other said i dreamed that i was carrying on my head bread that birds were eating of
they said inform us of the interpretation of this verily we see that thou art one of the muhsinun gooddoers see v 2112
he said “ i will tell you its interpretation before this you have served arrives
this knowledge is one of the things my lord has taught me
i have forsaken the tradition of those who do not believe in god and the last day
i follow the faith of my fathers of abraham and isaac and jacob
we do not associate with him
this is of allahs commandments and to us and to us – allah is most munificent towards mankind but most men do not give thanks
say o two companions of the prison is more worthy that god creator
you worship besides him idols and what you worship besides him
no authority was sent down by god
the judgement is only gods plan
worship allah
that is the right religion but most men know not
o two companions of the prison as one of you will pour out wine for his lord king and as for the other he will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head
the affair is decided whereon the matter you enquire
and he said to the one he deemed should be saved of the two mention me in thy lords presence
but satan caused him to forget to mention him to his lord so he continued in prison for certain years
and the king said verily i saw in a dream seven healthy cows whom seven lean cows were eating and seven green ears of corn and seven others dry o courtmembers
explain my dream if it is that you can interpret dreams ”
they said medleys of dreams and in the interpretation of dreams we are not skilled
and the one who was released said “ i will tell you its interpretation so send me forth ”
o yusuf joseph turn away from this
joseph told us and a company we brought a healthy cows which seven lean cows were eating and to tell us – so that seven healthy cows were seven green ears of corn and seven others dry o courtmembers
belike he may bring unto mankind their way and they will not be guided
he said sow as usual for seven years and after reaping leave the corn in the ears except the little you need for food
then thereafter will come a year wherein the people will have tarried in which you have abundant rain and in which they will press wine and oil
then thereafter will be a year wherein the people will be succoured and press in season
the king said bring him to me
then when the messenger came to him yusuf joseph said return to your lord and ask him what happened to the women who cut their hands
my lord is cognisant of what they do
the king said what aileth you when ye solicited yusuf against himself
they said “ purity is to allah – so be ”
they said we know no evil against him
they said “ o my lord
the wife of alaziz said now the truth is manifest to all it was i who sought to seduce him
and if he be of the truthful
he said that is in order that he may know that i betrayed him not in secret and that god does not guide the corrupters
he said i am forbidden only by the lord of the worlds
verily my lord is oftforgiving most merciful
the king said bring him to me i will attach him to my person
then when he had spoken with him he said today thou art established firmly in our favour and in our trust
he said set me over the lands storehouses i am a knowing guardian
thus we gave yusuf joseph authority in the land so that he might try you
we bestow of our mercy on whomever we will and we waste not the reward of the righteous
and surely the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and ever fear
and they came to their brothers in islamic monotheism
he recognised them though they did not recognise him
when he had supplied their provisions he said bring them a brother with you and you have no doubt as a brother with your father
see you not that i fill up the measure and that i am the best of hosts
but if you bring him not to me there shall be no measure provisions for you with me and you shall not come near me
they said we will solicit him of our father that we will do
and he said to his pages put their merchandise in their saddlebags haply they will recognize their people when they will recognize their people when they will return
when they returned to their father they said o father
so send our brother with us that he may bring more grain
they said we shall see that our father and we shall take care of him
he said “ o my lord
but god is the best of guardians and he is the most merciful of all
and when they opened their bags their money he said to them “ give their parents a reward of their own people what they had spent
what more can we ask for
what more can we ask for
what more can we desire and our brother shall be returned to our father
he said i will not send him with you until you bring me a solemn pledge by god that i will surely bring him back to me unless you are overtaken by misfortune
when they had made a promise shown to him he said “ this is what god has given me ”
and he said “ o my sons enter by one gate but enter by different gates and do not enter by different gates
god does not know what we will in the least
the judgement is only gods plan
i have placed my trust in him
the trusting place their trust in him
and when they entered after their fathers and their sons they found their father had no need in their footsteps and we rescued them from their dwellings in which they had no knowledge of it
then they found one of our votaries whom we had given blessed and fled with us
verily we we have been sending against him a torment
and when they entered in yusuf he betook his full brother unto himself and said verily i am thine brother yusuf so that they may be of the welldoers
so grieve not for what they do
then when he had equipped them with their equipment he put his drinkingcup into his brother ’s bag and then he brought it down o people of the caravan
you are indeed thieves ”
they said while they turned toward them what is it that ye miss
they said we miss the kings cup and for him who bringeth it shall be a camelload and thereof i am a guarantor
one of them said verily i am going to do my people
they said by allah you know well that we came not to work corruption in the land we are not robbers
they yusufs joseph men said what then shall be the penalty of him if you are proved to be liars
the punishment for that should be that he in whose pack it is found shall himself be recompense thereof
thus we recompense the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
then he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother then he brought it forth from his brothers sack
thus we sent yusuf joseph astray in this wise
except what he wills
we raise to degrees whom we please but over every knowing one of them is the allknowing allah
they said if he is a thief a brother of his was a thief before
but yusuf concealed it in himself and discovered it not unto them
and allah knows best what you say is in your breasts and allah knows what is in your hearts
they said “ o governor
they said aziz verily he hath a father an old father an old man very aged so take one of us in his stead verily we behold thee of the welldoers
she said what is the matter with me that i should seek refuge with allah from the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
god forbid that we should take anyone but him
we shall indeed be unjust
when they despaired of persuading him they went aside to confer
the oldest of them said you know that your father has pledged you in the name of god and has taken a sacrifice devoured by you and you have been guilty of iniquity
“ o my father i will not leave this land until allah permits me or allah decides my place for me is the best of all judges ”
return to your father and say o our father
enquire from the people of the city or ask the men of paradise wherein we have been and your caravan in which we have been able
we are truthful
he said nay your selves have embellished for you an affair so seemly patience and allah is to be implored for help in that which ye ascribe
and he turned away from them and said alas my grief for yusuf and his eyes whitened with grief while he was filled with suppressed sorrow
and he turned his back and said alas the separation from yusuf but his loved the eyes of his people
they said by allah thou wilt never cease remembering yusuf until thou art wizened or thou be of the dead
he said i only complain of my grief and sorrow to allah and only i know from allah that which you know not
depart my sons and search out tidings of joseph and his brother and do not despair of gods comfort no man despairs but god ’s mercy does not believe except a people who do not believe
they said o ruler of the land
give full measure and weight with equity and give us full measure and give us full measure and be charitable to us verily allah has forgiven us and give full measure and be charitable
god does rewards those who give alms
he said did you do what you did with yusuf joseph and his brother when you were ignorant
they said art thou yusuf indeed
he said verily i am yusuf joseph and this is my brother
god has been gracious to us
he said “ i am with those who fears allah and never to reward the reward of the virtuous ”
they said by allah assuredly allah hath preferred thee above us and we have been sinners
he said no reproach on you today may rescue you and he is the most merciful of the merciful
go with this shirt of mine and cast it on my fathers face he will come to me
and come forth from the city who shall be averse
and when the caravan had come their father said surely feel the smell of yusuf if ye think not that i am doting
they said by allah certainly you are in your old confusion
then when the bearer of glad tidings came he laid it on his face and he saw his shirt was over it and he became clearsighted
they said our father ask forgiveness of our crimes for verily we have been sinners
he said presently i shall pray for forgiveness for you of my lord verily he is ever forgiving merciful
when they reached his father he gave him his mother in the ship he had put him in disgrace
and he seated his parents on his seed and they all prostrated except him
he said o my father
my lord has made it come true
he was good to me when he brought you out of the prison and brought you out of the desert after the satan had brought you out of the desert after satan had sown with resentment
he is the wise the knower
o my lord thou hast given me of the dominion and hast taught me of the interpretation of discourses creator of the heavens and the earth
o listener followers of this prophet
o you assembly of jinns and men
“ and make me die among the honoured ”
this is news of the unknown we reveal to you which neither you nor your people knew them
and you o muhammad saw were not present when they threw their lots with their pens as to throw were a tremendous trial
and however much men may long for them we will not accept faith
even though you ask no recompense of them
this is naught but an admonition unto the worlds
how many a sign there is in the heavens and in the earth that they pass by turning away from it
most of them were mushrikun the disbelievers in the oneness of allah polytheists idolaters etc
what do they not expect from the punishment of allah or the hour will come upon them suddenly or openly during them till the hour comes upon them suddenly while they perceive not
say this is my way i call to god with sure knowledge i and whosoever follows after me
“ and i am commanded to be of the astray ”
glory be to god
i am not an idolater
and we sent not before thee any but men whom we inspired from among the people of townships
have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them
the abode of the hereafter is better for those who fear
will you not then understand
until when the messengers despaired deeming they were counted liars our help came to them
our might will never be turned back from the people of the sinners
indeed in their stories is a lesson for men of understanding
this is not the word of an evidence and he is not given the books before it and a confirmation of what preceded from their lord and a distinguishing of every thing and a guidance and a mercy and a reminder to the believers
a guidance and a mercy unto a people who believe
alif lam mim ra
these are the verses of the book
these are the verses of the book the quran and that which is sent down to you from your lord is the truth but most men do not believe
it is god who raised the heavens without pillars you can see then he sat himself upon the throne and he has subjected the sun and the moon each one runs to its course
he disposeth the affair and detaileth the signs that haply they may reflect
and it is he who stretched forth the earth and placed therein firm mountains and rivers and roads therein in it we have placed in it firm mountains and made all things to flow
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect
and in the earth are regions neighbouring and gardens of vines and cornfields and palmtrees clustered and single watered by the same water yet some of them are some others in food
and we have made some of them follow the others that are recited to them
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and if you are amazed then indeed the amazement is at their saying that “ will we indeed be created anew ”
they are those who disbelieve in their lord and on the day of resurrection they shall be those who disbelieve in their lord
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
they ask you to hasten on the torment before the people of the terrible punishment yet many a punishments have passed before them
and many a generation have we destroyed before them
but your lord is forgiving full of forgiveness for their sin
and the torment of your lord is severe
and those who disbelieve say why is not a sign sent down to him from his lord
you o muhammad saw are only a warner ie your duty is to convey allahs message to mankind but the guidance is in allahs hand
for every people there is a sign
every female beareth or bringeth forth
therein breathing out with deep sighs and roaring will be their portion and therein they will be therein not
every soul shall be pledged for what it has earned
the knower of the invisible and the visible the supreme the great the grand
high be he exalted above that they associate with him
equal is he among you who conceals his saying he who proclaims it he who hides himself in the night and he who sallies by day
for every person there is angels in succession before him and behind him they guard him with allahs command
god does not guide a people who do corruption in the land for god does not guide a people who are a people who are ignorant
and when allah intendeth evil unto a people there is no turning back his constitution and none other than he
it is he who shows you the lightning for fear and hope and raises massive clouds
the thunder proclaims
and he sends thunderbolts and strikes you whomsoever he will yet he will yet those you associate with them who can not even though he wills
god is allpowerful and allmighty
to call on him is true supplication
and those whom they call upon beside allah can not answer them
and those who call upon them dumb and they invoke not his lord at all – their shadows is like a man who puts forth his burden and none can transgress beyond his own desires
but the praying of unbelievers will be all in vain
and to allah only prostrate all those who are in the heavens and in the earth willingly or helplessly – and their shadows – every morning and evening command of prostration 2
say who is the lord of the heavens and the earth
say god
say have you then taken others beside him patrons who have not power to profit them harm or hurt themselves
say are the blind and the seeing man equal or the darkness and the light equal
or have they ascribed to god associates who created as he created so that the creation may be their creation and the creation seemed alike to them
say god is the creator of all things and he is the one the omnipotent
he sends down water from the sky and riverbeds flow according to their capacity
the water of god is but as scum upon the foam like unto the foam that over which we kindle a fire of heaven and men
thus doth allah propound the similitude of the truth
as for the scum it vanishes as jetsam and what profits men abides in the earth
thus doth allah propound parables
for those who answered their lords call believed in the oneness of allah and followed his messenger muhammad saw ie islamic monotheism is alhusna ie paradise
if they had all that is in the earth and therewith the ransom himself therewith and if the riches of the infidels they would ransom themselves therewith
these for them shall be an evil reckoning and their resort is hell a hapless bed
what is he who knows what is revealed to you from your lord is the truth and what is sent down to you from your lord
but only the men of understanding heed advice
those who fulfill the covenant of allah and break not the mithaq bond treaty covenant
those who unite what allah has commanded to be united and fear their lord and apprehend the evil of the account
and those who patiently endured and who were patient in the way of their lord and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give from what we have provided them secretly and openly and their good deeds that is the best of those who keep their fathers time
adn eden paradise everlasting gardens which they will enter and also those who acted righteously from among their fathers and their wives and their offspring
and the angels will enter unto them from every portal saying
peace be upon you
excellent is the final home
and those who break the covenant of allah after its ratification and sever that which allah has commanded to be joined ie they sever the bond of kinship and work mischief in the land for them is a curse and they will be cursed in the land and they
allah increases the provision for whom he wills and straitens it for whom he wills and they rejoice in the life of this world
and the life of this world is just a brief usage and the next of the hereafter is the best for one who fears allah
and those who disbelieve say why is not a sign sent down to him from his lord
say god leads whosoever he wills astray and guides whosoever he please to himself whosoever he please
those who believe and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of allah
lo in the remembrance of allah they are the solace of hearts ”
verily those who believe and do righteous works theirs shall be a promise of truth
thus have we sent you o muhammad saw to a community before whom other communities have passed away and that they may recite unto you what we have inspired in you
in fact they deny the most gracious
there is no god but he
in him i have put my trust and to him i turn
and if there were a quran which could cause to move or the mountains could have been removed from their places or the earth would be cloven asunder or the dead could be made to speak it would have been so that they would not have been dead
and to allah return all matters for decision
did not the believers know that if god had willed he would have guided all mankind
or are the unbelievers of the libertines
and those who disbelieve will not cease to harm them until they tasted the punishment or regret by god ’s command came to a stated term
verily allah faileth not his tryst
and indeed many messengers were mocked before you o muhammad saw but those that scoffed at them were cried lies to before you
then i seized them and how was my retribution
how was then my retribution
is he then who is a guarantor over it
yet they ascribe compeers to god
say thou look ye them in your error
or is it you know not that you know not about god in the earth
or is it only empty talk
in fact the unbelievers plots are made to look attractive to them so that they are held back from the right path
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there will be no guide
for them is a torment in the life of the world and certainly harder is the torment of the hereafter and the torment of the hereafter is far more severe
and there is no defender against allah
the description of the paradise which the muttaqun pious see v 22 have been promised underneath it rivers flow its fruits are unending and its shade this is the reward of those who fear and the disbelievers may say what is in the end final destination of the disbelievers
that is the requital of the godfearing
those to whom we have given the book and to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are the ones to whom we have given the books jews and christians before it they recite the verses or the qur’an in which you invite them
and you are denying of the quran
say thou i am commanded that should worship allah and should associate not aught with him
abasing exalting
even so we have sent it down as an arabic judgment
and if you follow their whims after all the knowledge that has come to you then you will not find any protector or guardian over them
and we sent not before thee any messenger except with a nation whom we inspired
god blots out what he wills and confirms what he wills
whether we show you some of what we promise them or we cause you to die still towards us is their return
ours is surely then to reckon with them
do they not see that we come to the land diminishing it in its extremities
and the decision is only with allah and he is swift in reckoning
and indeed those before them did devise plots but all planning is allah
he knows what every soul earns
and the disbelievers will soon learn for whom is the abode of the hereafter
and those who disbelieve say thou art not an apostle
say god suffices as a witness between me and you and this quran
alif lam ra
say thou verily
a book that we have sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him from the realms of darkness towards light – which is sent down to you from the light towards the arabic having thought
allah to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
so woe to the unbelievers for a terrible chastisement
those who prefer the present life over the world dearer to take it than the hereafter and they bar from gods way desiring this world to make it crooked they are in far error
they wander astray in far error
and we sent not a messenger except with the language of his people in order that he may make clear to them
god leads whosoever he wills astray and guides whosoever he will to the way
and he is the allmighty the allwise
and we sent moses with our signs bring forth thy people from the shadows to the light and remind them of the days of the days of man
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and remember when musa moses said to his people remember allahs favour on you when he saved you from the people of firaun pharaoh who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters and in that was a great trial from your lord
in that was a great trial from your lord
and if you are grateful by your lord i will give you more and if you are thankless then surely my punishment is very great
and musa moses said if you and his people you disbelieve in the earth and yourselves are not to be ungrateful
and indeed the noble messengers before you have also been denied before you so do you not know that you know from allah what you do not know
their messengers came to them with clear proofs
their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they said verily we disbelieve in that which you have been sent with
their messengers said god forbid that he may forgive you of your sins and retain you till a term stated and then in doubt
you are only human beings like us
you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship
they said “ bring us to our gods now you wish to turn us away from what our ancestors worshiped so bring us a clear proof ”
their messengers said to them “ we are no human being like you but god chooses whom he wills of his servants whom he wills
it is not for any messenger to bring you an authority proof except by the leave of allah
and in allah let believers put their trust
and why should we not repose our trust in god when he has shown us our paths of duty to him
we shall bear with fortitude the hardships you inflict upon us
in him i have put my trust and in god let all put their trust
and those who disbelieved said to their messengers “ we will surely drive you out of our land or else you will return ”
their lord sent down on them truly we shall destroy the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
then we shall make you dwell in the land after them
this is for him who fears my station and dreads my commination
and they sought a decision and every stubborn rebel was destroyed
after him he will be made to drink liquid pus discharged from the wounds of other people in hell
which he gulpeth but wellnigh swalloweth not and death cometh upon him from every side while yet he is dead and behind him is a terrible chastisement
and there will be a terrible torment trails him
the likeness of those who disbelieve in their lord their works are as ashes whereon the wind blows strong upon a tempestuous day
they will not have power over anything with what they have earned
this is the straight path
beholdest thou not that allah hath created the heavens and the earth with purpose and thereafter allah is able to do all things
and this is not hard for allah
and they will all appear before allah when they will all appear before allah on the day of resurrection then those who were counted weak will say to those who were arrogant verily we were your followers so can you avail you in the least
they will say verily allah hath guided us
alike it is to us whether we can not endure or whether we are patient
and when the satan had made them their wali saying it is certainly allah said to them o my people i have indeed turned you astray
and i had no power over you
i only ran you out of belief in the ignorant
so blame me not but blame yourselves
i disavow your having associated me earlier with god
nay but i am in fact a messenger to you and me have associated with him that i created them
and verily for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is a painful torment
but those who believed and did good deeds by the leave of their lord will be given to gardens beneath which rivers flow in paradise abiding in it forever by the one who is ever an entertainment from the lord of his creation
peace be upon you
beholdest thou not how allah hath propounded the similitude of a goodly word it is as a goodly tree its root firmly fixed and its branches reaching unto heaven
giving its fruit at every season by the leave of allah
and allah propoundeth similitudes for mankind that haply they may reflect
and the likeness of a corrupt word is as a corrupt tree uprooted from the earth having no stablishment
allah keepeth firm those who believe by the firm word in the life of the world and in the hereafter
and allah doth that which he willeth
hast thou not seen those who exchanged the bounty of god with unthankfulness and caused their people to dwell in the abode of ruin
hell where they will roast in the fire
and what a wretched place to return
and they set up compeers to god that they may lead astray from his way
say enjoy your brief life but your destination is hell fire
say to my servants who believe observe your devotional obligations and spend in charity of what we have given them secretly and openly before the day arrives when there will be no buying or selling or befriending
it is god who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky and with it he has fashioned you thereby and he has set in the ships for you to seek his bounty and he has subjected for you the ships to run on
he harnessed the sun and the moon so that each runs its appointed course for you
and allah has given you some of all things and has given you a scripture
and if you count gods blessing you will never number it surely man is sinful unthankful
man is dearly unthankful
and remember when ibrahim abraham said o my lord make this city makkah a place of peace and security and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols
“ o my lord they have misled many
so whoever follows me
and whosoever disobeyeth me then verily thou art forgiving merciful
“ o our lord i have settled some of my descendants in a valley having no cultivation near your sacred house – o our lord and perform assalat iqamatassalat so that they may be appreciative ”
our lord verily thou knowest that which we conceal and that which we make known
and nothing is hidden from allah on earth or in the heaven
all the praises and thanks be to allah who has given me in old age ismail ishmael and ishaque isaac
my lord is indeed the allhearer of invocations
my lord make me establisher of prayer and also from my progeny our lord and accept my supplication
our lord forgive me and my parents and the believers on the day when the reckoning will be established
think not of those who are wicked
he is deferring them to a day when they shall not be able to face
they hastening forward heads with their eyes running water in their hearts and they shall run forward with fear of their lord and their greeting therein they shall not return unto them
and warn thou mankind of the day when the torment will come to them and warn them with the humiliating torment them and we will answer thy call o our lord
and you dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves and it was clear to them what was hidden in their homes
and we have put forth many parables for you
they are devising guile
and the mountains are carried away by wind and they carried not till they plan lying down on their sides
so think not that god will fail to keep his promise to his messengers
verily allah is allmighty allable of retribution
on the day when the earth will be changed into another earth and the heavens will be shaken with a position and all the irresistible
and thou wilt see the guilty on that day bound together in fetters
their garments will be of pitch and fire will cover their faces
that allah may requite each person according to what he has earned
god is swift in reckoning
this is a message to be delivered to mankind that they may know that he is one god and that they may know that he is a warner to men possessed of minds
alif lam mim ra
these are the verses of the book and the perspicuous oration
the unbelievers will ardently wish that if only they had been muslims at the time of death in their graves on the day of resurrection
leave them to eat and enjoy and let them be preoccupied with false hope
and we have never destroyed a township but there was a known decree for it
no community can anticipate its term nor can they delay it
and they say o you upon whom the dhikr the quran has been sent are surely mad
why bringest thou not angels unto us if thou art of the truthtellers
we send not down angels save with the truth and they will not be respited
verily we it is we who send down the dhikr ie the quran and surely we will not believe in it
we sent messengers before you o muhammad saw amongst the sects communities of old
and never came a messenger to them but they did mock him
thus we might make it known
they believe not therein the wo nt of the ancients hath gone
even if we opened to them a door in the heaven and they passed the day mounting thereto
they would still say our eyes have been dazzled nay we are a people bewitched
and indeed we have put in heaven big stars in the heaven and we have beautified it for the beholders
and we have guarded it near heaven from every outcast shaitan devil
except one who sometimes steals a part so a blazing flame goes after him
and thou beholdest the earth blackened excellent in it and we have made mountains as anchors in it and in it grew all things easy for god hears all and knows everything
and we have provided therein gardens of datepalms and grapes for you and have made therein your provision ie you have made therein your provision and we have appointed for you the way of your lord ie to be a provision ie as repose
there is not a thing that we have not been able to have the treasures of the heavens and the earth and we send it not down in a book but it is not in a book
and we send the winds fertilizing then we send down water from the heaven and we give it to you to drink and you are not at all treasurers
it is we who give life and cause death and we are the inheritors
and assuredly we know those of you who go forward and assuredly we shall raise those of you who lag behind
verily your lord will gather them together surely he is allwise allknowing
we created man of clay
and the jinn we created aforetime from the smokeless flame of fire
and recall what time thy lord said unto the angels verily i am about to createa man from ringing clay of loam moulded
and when i have fashioned him and breathed into him of my spirit fall down prostrating with him
so the angels prostrated themselves all of them together
except iblis he refused to be among those bowing
said he what ails thee iblis that thou art not among the prostrators
said he i would never bow myself before a mortal whom thou hast created of a clay of mud moulded
said he then go hence ostracised
and verily the curse shall be upon you till the day of recompense ie the day of resurrection
he said my lord respite me till the day they shall be raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
till the day of the time appointed
he said my lord verily i have gone astray from my way and i have led them astray in the earth
except your chosen slaves amongst them faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
said he this is a way of rectitude
verily you will have no power over my devotees but you did not have authority over them
and surely hell is the promised place for them all
it has seven gates for each gate is a portion assigned from them
verily the godfearing will be in a station secure
enter therein in peace secure
and we shall remove from their breasts any sense of injury that they may have thought that they would become pure white with disease and their private parts etc is forbidden to them which they will become virgins
no fatigue shall touch them nor shall they ever be driven forth therefrom
inform my bondmen that undoubtedly i surely am the oftforgiving the most merciful
and that my punishment is for them a painful torment
and tell them of the guests of abraham
when they came to him they said peace
he said verily we are afraid of you
they said fear not verily we bring thee an expert magician to his heart
he said what do you not bring me good news when old age has overtaken me
what do you convey the news ”
they said we have given thee good tidings of truth so be not of those who despair
he said and who despairs of the mercy of his lord excepting those who are astray
he said what is the matter with you o messengers
they said we have been sent to a people who are mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disbelievers in allah
except the family of lot whom we will save them all
we therefore found not therein except his wife who became of those who stayed behind
then when the messengers the angels came to the family of lout lot
he said verily you are people unknown to me
they said nay we have come to thee with the truth and we have come to thee with the truth
we have come to you with the truth and indeed we are truthful
so set out with your family in a watch of the night and follow the backs of the night and let none look back but look at them and let none look back
and none of you could withhold them
go to the shadow with spreading
and we decreed unto him this commandment that the last remnant of those should be cut off in the morning
and the people of the city came rejoicing to the house of prophet lut
he said these are my guests put me not to shame
for them we have decreed every living creature
and fear allah and humiliate me not
and fear allah and humiliate me not
they said did we not forbid you from strangers and the muslims from the people of lot
he said these are my daughters if act ye must
say thou verily
by your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – they are indeed straying in their intoxication
then the shout took hold of them at the sunrise
and we turned it uppermost nethermost and rained on it stones of baked clay
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
and you would become yellow because of it – so you would become disobedient to allah
verily in this is a sign for those who believe
the dwellers in the wood near midian were also wicked
so we took vengeance on them
and verily either both on the highroad open
the dwellers in elhijr cried lies to the envoys
and we gave them our signs and they turned away from them
they used to hew dwellings in the mountains to live in security
and the cry seized them in the morning
and all that they used to earn availed them not
we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth
so pardon them verily the hour is grievous
verily your lord is the allknowing creator
we have given you seven of the oftrepeated examples and the majestic quran
do not direct your eyes towards what we have given to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him to maintain the part of the book and do not grieve over them and lower your wing to be believers
and say i am the manifest warner
even as we sent down on the dividers
who make a band of the burthens above them so they have made up
by your lord we shall question them one and all
about their deeds
so declare to you that which is inspired in you and turn away from almushrikun see v 2105
we suffice thee against the mockers
who set up another god with god
again no one but must come to know
we know indeed your breast is straitened by what they say
so glorify the praises of your lord and be among those who prostrate themselves to him
and worship thy lord until there cometh unto thee the certainty
god is the truth from that they ascribe to him
he sends the angels with the spirit by his command to whomever he wills of his slaves
he created the heavens and the earth with reason too glorious and high is he for what they associate with him
he created man of a spermdrop and behold he is a manifest adversary
and he has created them for you in them there is warmth and uses various and of them you eat
and in them is your elegance when you bring them home at evening and when you leave them to graze
and they carry your loads to territory around you great hardship
surely your lord is allclement allcompassionate
and he has created horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and as an adornment
he created other things too which you do not know
and that to guide allah is the right path
had he willed he would have guided you all together
and from the sky water and from the earth you own provision and from it we send down water from the sky
with it he causes to grow for you the crops the olives the datepalms the grapes and every kind of fruit verily
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect
and he has subjected to you the night and the day and the sun and the moon and the stars are subjected by his command
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and of the cattle he has created you in the earth for you that he may ride upon some of what you eat
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who understand
and it is he who has created the stars for you so that you may eat of it fresh meat from it and that you may seek of his bounty and that you may be grateful
and he has affixed into the earth mountains standing firm lest it should shake with you and rivers and roads that you may guide yourselves
and created for you in pairs
is he who creates like him who does not create
will you not then contemplate
and if you count the graces of allah never could you be able to count them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah knows what you conceal and what you reveal
and those whom they call upon besides allah have not created anything but are themselves created
dead are they not alive and they perceive not when they will be raised up
and they will not be raised when they will be raised up
your god is one god
and they do not believe in the hereafter their hearts deny the truth
they are but your own selves and for them is a thing yet you are not able to do so
verily allah knoweth that which they keep secret and that which they publish
verily allah likes not each arrogant boaster
and when it is said to them what is it that your lord has sent down they say fairytales of the ancients
and they bear their own burdens in full on the day of resurrection and they will carry their burden on their own burdens
lo vile is that which they judge
and those before them had plotted but all planning is allahs
verily those who were destroyed by allah did not send down the foundations of their building and the roof fell down upon them from above them and the torment overtook them while they perceive not
then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and ask where are my associates concerning whom you contended
those who have been given the knowledge will say to those who have been given knowledge shame and destruction at your day
and they will be thrown into their souls by the angels draw near of what state when they are doing evil
enter the gates of gehenna to dwell therein forever
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
and when it is said to those who took heed for themselves what is it that your lord has sent down
for those who do good in this world good and the home of the hereafter is better
how excellent the dwelling of the godfearing
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
thus will the pious and devout be rewarded
they will say peace be upon you
enter paradise for what you did
await they just for the angels or the punishment from your lord to appear or the angels
likewise did those before them
it was not allah who wronged them but they wronged themselves
so the evil results of their deeds overtook them and that at which they used to mock surrounded them
and the polytheists said “ had allah willed we would not have worshipped anything besides him nor would we have forbidden our forefathers nor would we have forbidden anything whilst being disassociated with him ”
likewise did those before them
the messengers duty ie our messenger muhammad saw whom we have sent to you o mankind is but to convey the message clearly
and indeed we sent to every nation a messenger saying worship allah and keep his company duty to him and to worship him allah
some of them god guided and some of them were justly disposed to error
so travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied the truth
if you o muhammad saw covet for their guidance then verily allah guides not those whom he sends astray or none can guide him whom he leads astray
and they swear by allah their strongest oaths that allah will not raise up him who dies
nay allah has brought him a true promise ie allahs religion islamic monotheism but most of them know not tafsir attabari vol 27 page 36
in order that he may make clear to them what they differed about and the unbelievers may realise that they were at variance on
and our command for anything to occur when we will it is that we only say to it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
and as for those who emigrated for the sake of allah after they had been wronged we shall surely place in the land after they had been oppressed
and allah is ever allknower of what you do
those who patiently endured and who rely only upon their lord
and we sent not before you o muhammad saw any but men whom we inspired from among the people of townships
and we have sent them clear signs and the clear signs that they may explain to them what was sent down to them and what was sent down to them
do they not see that god will not cause the earth to sink them or that the punishment will not fall upon them from a place they do not know
or that he will not seize them in their going to and fro and they will not be able to frustrate him
they will never be able to save themselves from allahs punishment
or did he not take hold of them a play in fear of that he will not take hold of them in fear
surely your lord is allclement allcompassionate
do they not see that allah has created their shadows incline to the right and to the left making prostration to the left prostrating themselves to allah and to him
and to allah prostrateth itself whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth of the living creatures and also the angels and also the angels and they are not stiffnecked
they fear their lord above them and they do what they are commanded
and allah has proclaimed “ do not ascribe two gods indeed he is the one god who accepts faith in him ”
he is only one god
but fear me
and to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and that the religion is entirely
so will you fear other than god
verily allah is unto you ever potent
then when harm touches you it only because of harm touches you
then when he removes the affliction from you lo a party of you assign associates to their lord
so as to deny what we have bestowed on them
you will come to know
and they appoint a share of that we have provided them
by god you will certainly be questioned about what you used to fabricate
and they assign daughters to allah glorified and exalted be he above all that they associate with him
and when news of a female child is announced “ he is informed of the news of the unseen ” – he remains seething
he hides himself from the people because of the evil of what he has been informed
will he keep her with dishonour or bury her in the earth
how bad is the judgement that they make
those who do not believe in the hereafter for them only is the evil likeness gods is the loftiest likeness he is the allmighty the allwise
and if allah were to seize mankind for their wrongdoing he would not leave a single moving living creature on the earth but he postpones them for their wrongdoing
but god prescribes for them of night and day
when their time is come they can neither delay it an hour nor advance it an hour or a moment
and they assign to allah that which they dislike for themselves and their tongues assert the falsehood that they may credit against allah and their tongues utter this is good and their tongues utter against them and they practise their tongues and not to them and in the path
by god we sent messengers to many nations before you but satan decked out fair to them their deeds and they will surely say the devil was their evil deeds
the day the satan made their deeds appear good to them and he is their defender today
for them there is a painful torment
and we have sent down this book to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him as a mercy for those who believe in what they have been doing and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
and allah sends down water from the sky and with it revived the earth after its death indeed in this is a sign for people who listen
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who understand
and indeed in cattle is a lesson for you we give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from between filth and blood pure milk sweet to drinkers
and of the fruits of the palms and the vines you take therefrom an intoxicant and a provision fair surely in that is a sign for a people who understand
and thy lord inspired the bee saying take thou of the mountains houses and of the trees and of what they erect and in them their glances of them trees and they have been created by them
then eat of all manner of fruit and follow the ways of your lord easy for you
there comes forth from their bellies a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men
verily in that is a sign for a people who reflect
allah hath created you then he shall make you die and thereafter he shall make you die and thereafter he shall quicken you
and of you there are some who have gathered forward and others from you muslims
and allah is able to do all things
and allah has preferred some of you above others in wealth and properties
and those who are preferred will not be able to save themselves from their dependents so that they may become equal with them
they have no power over anything equal in comparison
and allah has made for you wives of your own kind and has made for you of your own kind and has made for you sons and has given you food
do they then believe in batil falsehood polytheism idols and all deities other than allah
and they worship such besides allah that which owneth them not any provision from the heavens and the earth and can not
so do not cite before you the examples of god
and allah knows and you know not
god has created you from the heavens and the earth and has set out of heaven water and the earth and the men of understanding are men who supplicate for god that he may judge between them is one of them
all the praises and thanks be to allah but most of them know not
and allah puts forth a similitude a slave man belonging to many partners and no one can do anything against them
wherever he is sent he returns without any good result
is he equal to one who enjoins what is just and follows the right path
to god belongs the unseen in the heavens and the earth
the hour is coming and the twinkling of an eye or even nearer
verily allah is able to do all things
and allah has brought you forth from the wombs knowing nothing but in play
and he gave you hearing sight and hearts that you may be grateful
do they not see the birds held flying in the midst of the sky
none upholds them except allah
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and allah has made for you wives of your homes in your homes and has made for you homes places of rest and has made for you houses and made your houses during the day of resurrection and on the day of resurrection he will be made for you
and allah has made for you shade from that he has created shades and has made for you places of refuge in the mountains places of refuge and has given you garments to protect you from the heat and shirts to protect you from your violence
and allah has made for you a complete favour on you that he may conclude a matter that you should be grateful
but if they turn away we have not sent you o muhammad saw as a hafiz protector over them ie takes care of their deeds and to recompense them
they recognize the favour of allah then they deny it and most of them are infidels
and bewore a day whereon we shall raise up from each community a witness and they will not be permitted to please allah nor will they be permitted to please allah
and when those who did wrong the disbelievers will see the torment then it will not be lightened unto them nor will they be given respite
and when the idolaters see their associates they will say our lord these are our associates whom we called upon apart from you
they will fling back at them the saying surely you are truly liars
and they will offer their submission to allah and their invented false deities will vanish from them that which they used to fabricate
verily those who disbelieve and hinder others from the way of allah ie islam for them shall be a torment humiliating torment in the hellfire
we shall bring you a witness from every people and every people we shall bring you o muhammad saw as a witness against them
and we have not sent thee an evidence as a witness and we have sent thee as a witness against mankind and we have sent thee as a guidance and glad tidings unto the muslims
verily allah commandeth justice and welldoing and giving to kindred and he prohibiteth lewdness and wickedness and oppression he exhorteth you that haply ye may beadmonished
that then he has charged you with haply you will remember
and fulfil the covenant when you have covenanted and break not the oaths after you have confirmed them and do not break your oaths after you have confirmed them and do not break your oaths indeed allah knows what you do
god is aware of what you do
and do not be like her who untwists her yarn having spun it into durable thread do not use your oaths deceitfully because one party has ascendency over you
and allah warns you against himself his punishment and allah is full of kindness to the worldly life
and allah warns you against himself his punishment and allah is full of kindness to the worldly life
and on the day of resurrection he will announce to you what you were at variance
and had allah willed he would have made you all one nation but he sends astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills
but you will certainly be called to account for what you used to do
and do not make your oaths phoney excuses between yourselves lest a foot may slip after being steadfast and you may taste evil because of what you used to do
and purchase not a small gain at the cost of allahs covenant
what is with allah is better for you if you did but know
what you possess will abide except what is with god
and we shall pay them their hire in full for that which they have been working
and whosoever worketh of the male or female and is a believer we shall surely give him a goodly loan and shall surely increase unto him a goodly hire and we shall recompense them with a best of that which they have been working
and when you recite the qur’an seek refuge in allah from shaitan satan the outcast
verily he has no power over those who believe and put their trust in their lord
his authority is only over those who take him for an ally besides allah and his messenger muhammad saw and those who ascribe equals to him
and when we change a verse in place of another verse and allah knows very well what he sends down they said you are the best knower of that wwhich he revealeth they say you have done
the hour is surely with god yet most of them do not know
say thou the holy spirit hath brought it down from amongst us a guidance and glad tidings unto those who believe
and assuredly we know that they say is only a mortal a human being like unto whom we found a human being
the speech of him in which they hint is barbarous and this is speech arabic manifest
and they say in the matter of the quran that is a clear arabic
verily those who believe not in the signs of allahallah shall not guide them and unto them shall not guide them
for them there is a painful torment
only those who believe not in the signs of allah are sure to be seen by it
and whosoever disbelieveth on him shall his infidelity after he hath become manifest unto his infidelity then he shall have become manifest unto them that is in the error
but those who believe and die as disbelievers for them shall be a mighty torment
that is because allah guides not the worldly life of the hereafter and allah guides not the people who disbelieve
these are they upon whose hearts and hearing ears and sight eyes allah has set a seal and these they are the negligent
undoubtedly they in the hereafter they are the losers
then verily your lord unto those who have emigrated after they had been tempted and have thereafter striven hard and endured verily thy lord thereafter is forgiving merciful
on the day when every soul will come pleading for itself and every soul will be paid in full for what it has done and they will not be dealt with unjustly
and allah propoundeth a similitude a town which was secure and we illustrated several secure so that which is in it the township which was going to gush forth from every side
so allah made the people of the town taste of disgrace and feared him allah will disgrace them because of what they used to do
and assuredly there came unto them an apostle from among them but they belied him wherefore the torment took hold of them while yet they were wrongdoers
so eat of what god has provided you lawful and good and be you thankful for the blessing of god if it is he whom you are thankful
he has forbidden you only almaytatah meat of a dead animal blood the flesh of swine and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah or has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah or a sacrifice to him
and whosoever disobeyeth the revelations and transgresseth his soul he is the negligent ones
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and say not concerning that which your tongues falsely describe this is lawful and this is lawful and this is forbidden so that you may forge against allah falsehood surely that is in fact he is a lie
verily those who invent lies against allah will never prosper
a painful torment awaits them
and to those who are jews we have forbidden such things before you o muhammad saw
and they wronged themselves
then verily your lord for those who do evil commit sins and then repent thereafter and amend verily your lord thereafter is forgiving merciful
abraham was a nation obedient to god and he was a nation a abraham who was not of idolaters
and he was not of the associators
he was thankful for his allahs graces
then god chose him and guided him to a straight way
and we gave him good in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous
then we have inspired you o muhammad saw saying follow in the religion of ibrahim abraham hanifa islamic monotheism ie to worship none but allah and he was not of almushrikun see v 2105
the sabbath was decreed only for those who differed thereon surely we shall judge between them in that wherein they used to differ
verily your lord will judge between them in what they differ
call them to the way of thy lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation and argue with them with that which is best
verily your lord it is he who knows best who strays from his way and he knows best who has gone astray from his way
and if you patiently endure indeed the punishment of the hereafter is better for those who are patient and if you punish you patiently endure indeed the best for those who are assabirin the patient ones etc
and endure you patiently o muhammad saw your patience is only with allah and your patience is only with allah
and grieve not over them nor be distressed because of their scheming
verily allah is with those who fear him keep their duty to him and follow the straight path
blessed is he who has turned his servant to the holy mosque in a blessed place of safety from the people who recite our verses to them in order to recite the quran and we have made the quran a book to the right way of the prophet and
he is allhearing and allseeing
and we gave moses the book and made it a guidance for the children of israel take not for auliya protectors helpers to me
and we carried him with noah he was a grateful votary
and we decreed for the children of israel in the book you will create disorder twice and become arrogant in the land twice and become exceedingly arrogant
so when the promise came to pass we sent against you slaves of nuh noah they wronged their homes and they entered the dwellings in the most great towns of sodom in palestine truly their dwellings they were told
then we gave you a chance against them and strengthened you with wealth and children and increased your numbers and said
if you do good to the people who wronged their homes until they come back to make mischief of the land it is forbidden to you to do what they do so to destroy the enemy and to destroy their deeds and to destroy their deeds and to destroy
a people who are certain fools
belike your lord may yet have mercy on you and he may haply find mercy
but if you return we will do the same
we have prepared hell for the disbelievers hospitality
verily this quran guides to the path that is straight and gives glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that theirs shall be a great reward
and that those who do not believe in the hereafter – we have kept prepared a punishment most painful
man prays for good as he seeks goodness and man is ever hasty
we have made the night and the day to which they are asleep
and we have made the sign of your lord that you may seek the number of the years and the reckoning of your lord and that you may know the number of days
we have expounded most distinctly everything
and we have attached his destiny out of every man to his neck and we shall bring forth a register for him on the day of resurrection which he will find open
read your ledger this day you are sufficient to take your own account
whosoever goes astray he goes astray only for his own loss
no burdened soul laden bears the burden of another
and we never chastise until we send not a messenger to be destroyed
and never will we destroy a township but we destroy a town which we send among its people is with the righteous and the righteous among the righteous
but they were a people of the city which they destroyed it would be destroyed but we destroy it with disgrace and their people would not destroy it
and how many a generation have we destroyed after nuh noah
and sufficient is your lord as an allknower and allbeholder of the sins of his slaves
whosoever desires the hasty world we hasten for him in the life of this world we wish for him to do as we wish
then we shall roast him in hell
and whosoever desires the world to come and strives after it those they are the people of the hereafter
to eachthese and thosewe extend of the bestowment of thy lord and the bestowment of thy lord is never restrained
as for the grace of your lord and his bounty
behold how we prefer one above another in this world and indeed the hereafter is the greatest if we please and the hereafter and the highest in preference
set not up with allah any other ilah god lest you should be damned
and your lord has decreed that you worship none but him and be good to your parents
if one of them or both of them grow old in your presence do not say fie to them nor reprove them but say gentle words to them
and lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy and say my lord have mercy on them even as they have raised me up when i was small
your lord knows best what is in your innerselves
if you repent he is indeed forgiving and kind
and give the relative his rights and to the poor and to the wayfarer and squander not in squandering
verily the squanderers are ever the brethren of the satans
verily the satan is unto his lord ungrateful
but if you turn away from them a mercy from your lord ie the quran which you can turn away from them
and do not keep your hand tied to your neck nor open it completely lest you remain seated – reproached weary
verily your lord enlarges the provision for whom he wills and straitens for whom he wills
he is the allknower the allseer of his slaves
and do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty
we provide for them and for you
verily the torment took hold of them in a great sin
and come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse
it is indeed an evil halt and an evil way
and do not kill any living with whom allah has forbidden except for a just cause
and whosoever is killed intentionally with hostility and oppression and oppression we have not helped him to another body except by a man amongst you who is sure to be superior
and let not the man who is slain wrongfully we have not let him exceed limits in slaying the killer only and the relatives and the relatives
and do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner until he is of age
and give full measure when you are measuring and weigh with full and weigh on a balanced scale
that is the best and fairest interpretation
and follow not the matter of that which is beyond which you have no knowledge eg ones who is unable to bear and every thing is beyond that of which you have no knowledge eg ones who is beyond your lord eg ones saying i will be unable to
and walk thou not in the earth struttingly verily thou wilt by no means rend the earth nor canst thou attain to the mountains in stature
all the bad aspects of these the above mentioned things are hateful to your lord
these are the verses of your lord which we recite to you o muhammad saw
set not up with allah any other ilah god lest you should be thrown into hell blameworthy and rejected from allahs mercy
hath then your lord distinguished you with sons and taken for himself females from among the angels
you are speaking only a lie
and indeed we have illustrated all kinds of examples in this qur’an for mankind – and indeed we have explained in detail the truth and it increases them in all things only aversion
say if there had been other gods with him as they say then they would have sought a way unto the lord of the throne
hallowed be he and exalted above that which they associate
the seven skies the earth and all that lies within them sing hallelujas to him
all praise be to god but you do not understand their own desires
and allah is oftforgiving mostforbearing
and when you read the qur’an we created a barrier between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter
we have put coverings over their hearts lest they should understand it and deafness in their ears ie heaviness
and when you make mention of your lord alone la ilaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah islamic monotheism and when you turn away in repentance ie la ilaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah alone the one and he alone
we know well what they listen when they listen to you o muhammad saw and when they listen to you o muhammad saw but the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc say you follow none but a man bewitched
behold how they strike similitudes for thee
they are lost and can not find the way
and they say when we have become dust and bones shall we then indeed be raised up
say “ become stones or iron ”
or some creation yet more monstrous in your minds
they will surely say who will restore us
say he who created you the first time
they will shake their heads at you and say when will that be
say perhaps it may be nigh
on the day when he will call you and you will answer with his praises and imagine you did not tarry but a while
and say to my slaves ie the true believers of islamic monotheism that they should only say words that are the best
verily shaitan satan sows dissensions satan is indeed the acknowledged enemy of mankind
your lord knows you very well what is in your innerselves
he may defer you if he wills he may destroy you and bring about you the torment of if he wills
we have not sent you o muhammad saw as a guardian over them
we have not sent you o muhammad saw as a hafiz protector over them ie to take care of their deeds and to recompense them
and we created all those who are in the heavens and the earth with the same measure as he likes but we gave them full measure and we bestowed them with full measure
say call on those you imagine with god
they would not get the better of you nor be able to remove the least from you
those they call upon themselves seek access to their lord striving which of them is the nearest and they hope for his mercy and fear his torment
verily the torment of your lord is something to be afraid of
there is not a town but we shall destroy it on the day of resurrection or in accordance with the law of reckoning
nothing prevents us from sending miraculous signs except that the ancients called them lies
and they belied the signs of allah wherefore the bolt laid hold of them even while they slew it
and we send not the signs except to warn and to make them afraid of destruction
and recall what time we said unto thee verily thy lord is over mankind ever potent
and we made not the vision which we showed thee but we showed thee the tree thereof and we made them a temptation for mankind and we chose them and we frighten them in the cities
and we frighten them but it only increaseth them in exorbitance great
and recall what time we said unto the angels prostrate youselves before adam
he said what thinkest thou if thou being able to give me over his company of these nations ie the day of resurrection
allah said depart
and whosoever of them follows you surely shall be the recompense of you all an ample recompense
and istafziz literally means befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice ie songs music and any other call for allahs disobedience make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry mutually share with them wealth and children by tempting them to earn money
but satan promises them nothing but deceit
“ indeed my bondmen – you do not have any power over my bondmen except him who has a right way ”
and allsufficient is your lord as a guardian
your lord is he who drives the ship for you through the sea in order that you may seek his bounty surely your lord is oftforgiving most merciful
and when harm touches you upon the sea those that you call upon apart from him vanish except him allah alone then when he rescues you towards land you turn away and you call upon the sea
but when he brings you safely to land you turn away from him
man is dearly unthankful
do you feel secure that he will not cause a shore to swallow you up or loose against you a squall of pebbles
or are ye secure that he will not send you back a second time and loose against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your thanklessness then you will not be able to return any avenger
and assuredly we have honoured the children of adam and we have borne them on the land and the sea and we have provided them with good things and we have preferred them above all beings
on the day when we shall call all other than his companions this is the day of resurrection and whoso is given his book in his right hand those shall read their records held back in full
and whosoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the world to come and even more astray from the path
and verily they had wellnigh tempted thee away from that which we have revealed unto thee of that which we have revealed unto thee beside the divine revelation
and had we not kept you constant in it you would have surely stoned you to death
and had it not been for you o muhammad saw we would have made you taste a double portion of life and a double portion of death and then you would have found none to help you against us
and verily they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land
but a little after you had been to cry out but a little after you
this was our way we sent before you o muhammad saw of the message of islamic laws and wisdom etc
perform the prayer at the borders thereof and the day the night is over the day
verily assalat the recitation at dawn and in the evening or in the morning
and in the nighttime hallow its lord and also also in the presence of your lord
and say my lord in peace and admit me to a garden and make me one of the righteous
“ and make me a decision from yourself and do not send me a proof ”
and say truth has come and falsehood nullified verily falsehood is perishable
and we have sent down from the quran a healing and a mercy to the quran that is a mercy to the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and when we show mercy to man he withdraws and turns away
and when evil touches him he is in great despair
say each one acts according to his disposition
your lord knows best who has attained guidance and he is the best of those who are guided
they ask you about revelation
say the spirit is of the bidding of my lord
you have been given of knowledge nothing except a little
and if we willed we could have revealed to you which we have inspired you then you would find no one to plead for it or guardian over us
then he caused him to die and made him to be buried
except the mercy paradise of your lord o muhammad saw
nuun – by oath of the pen and by oath of what is written by it alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
say thou whether men and jinn leagued together that they might produce the like of this quran and if they could produce the like of this quran they could produce the like thereof even though they were witnesses
and indeed we have illustrated all kinds of examples in this qur’an for mankind – so most men refuse all the truth and accept nothing but disbelief and most of them are transgressors
and they say we will not believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us
or you have a garden of datepalms and grapes and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly
or till thou makest heaven to fall as thou assertest on us in fragments or thou bringest god and the angels as a surety god and the angels as a surety
or you have a house of adornable materials like silver and pure gold etc or you ascend up into heaven and even then we shall not believe in your ascent unless you send down a book on us which we will not believe in your own witness over anything
say glory be to my lord
but i am naught but a warner
i am not a guardian over you
and when guidance came to them they said “ what shall we believe in what you like ”
say if there were in the land angels walking about in peace and security we would have sent down to them out of heaven an angel as a messenger
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he is the allknower the allseer of his slaves
and whomsoever allah guides he is the guide of the straight path
and whomsoever allah guides not him whom he leads astray thou wilt never find for them any wali protector or helper
and we shall muster them on the day of resurrection their faces blind dumb deaf dumb blind and deaf their habitation blackened
their abode is hell and what an evil destination
we shall give the fire of gehenna therein to a cradling
this is their recompense because they disbelieved in our signs and said when we have become bones and decomposed will we really be raised up again in a new creation
do they not see that allah who created the heavens and the earth and all things like the earth is able to create others similar to it
he has appointed for them a term therein and he has appointed for them a term no doubt
lo verily the wrongdoers will not be successful
say if you possessed the treasuries of my lords mercy yet you would be spared
man is dearly unthankful
and assuredly we vouchsafed unto musa nine manifest signs ask the children of israelso when he came unto them and surely i have given thee an authority
ask the children of israel when he came to them and pharaoh said to him i think you are bewitched
musa said naught is in the heavens and the earth but a warner from thy lord
and firaun pharaoh said verily i am about to drive you away from firaun pharaoh
he therefore wished to expel them from the land so we drowned him and his companions all together
and we said to the children of israel after him dwell in the land then when we shall bring you a rabble
and with truth we have sent it down and with truth it has come down
and we have sent you o muhammad saw only as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner
and we have sent down the qur’an to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him as a sign for mankind and we have sent it down only a clear sign from our lord
say believe in it or do not believe those who were given knowledge before it when it is recited to them fall down prostrate
they say our lord
and they fall down on their faces weeping and it increases them in humility
say call on the allmerciful
to him belong the best names
so pardon them and ask forgiveness of your lord
a way between them
and say praise belongs to god who has not taken a son and who has not taken to associate any one with god
and magnify your lord with full knowledge
all the praises and thanks be to allah who has sent down to his slave muhammad saw the book the quran and has not placed therein any crookedness
immutable so that it may warn of a severe punishment from him and give happy tidings to those who believe and do good deeds that he may give them a goodly reward
they will abide in it for ever
and to warn those who say god has taken to himself a son
no knowledge of it nor did their fathers
how is it with their mouths they speak not
possibly you may risk your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him by grieving because they did not believe in them
we have made whatever is in the earth to try what is in order to test them to do what is best in conduct and may test them with what they have done
and we have made all that is on it a barren dust
or dost thou think the men of the cave and errakeem were among our signs a wonder
when the young men took refuge in the cave – and prayed “ our lord bestow on us mercy from yourself and facilitate for us our affair in our affair
we sealed off their ears in the cave for a number of years
then we raised them up again that we might know which of the two parties was best at calculating the time period that they had tarried
we narrate to you o muhammad saw their story with truth
they were young men who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
and we strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heavens and earth we strengthened their hearts with a hundred lashes and may be no more
there is no god but he
these our people have taken for worship aliha gods other than him allah
why do they not bring a clear proof against them
and who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against allah
and when you have disassociated yourself from them and all what they worship besides them and all what they worship besides allah – so take refuge in the cave and your lord will spread some of your proximity for you and will soon make you a righteous need of
you did not see the sun when it rises it shifts away to their right and left their cave and they walk in the left and it is not for a guidance
this is the creation of allah
and whomsoever allah guides for him thou shalt not find a guide to him whom allah sends astray thou wilt never find a way
and you would have thought them awake while they were asleep
and their dog was the blind and the one who was all obedient to allah
had you looked at them you would have certainly turned back from them in flight and been filled with awe of them
and even so we raised them up again that they might question one another
one of them said how long have you stayed here
they will say we stayed a day or part of a day
they said your lord knows very well how long you have stayed here
so send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town and let him look for wholesome food and bring it for you and bring it from the city of food
look then let man look at what he has sent forth for himself
if they come to know of you they will stone you or turn you back to their creed then you will never prosper
when you are lost in the graves
and thus we have made them stumble upon them that they might know that god might know that the people and that they might know that it is about to gather them and that god is allknowing allwise
and when they had contending among themselves regarding their affair then they said build over them a building
their lord is best cognisant of them
the people of the city said “ we will surely be victorious ”
they will say they were three the fourth among them their dog
they will say their dog was the sixth of them guessing at the unknown
and they will say they were three the fourth of them their dog
say my lord knows best their number none knows them but some few are themselves guided
and they have tarried in the earth save a few numbered days
so do not argue with them unless they do so
and never say of anything i shall do such and such thing tomorrow
except with this reservation that allah so will
and remember your lord when you forget and say and proclaim your lords mercy prophethood etc while you are in ease
and they stayed in their cave three hundred solar years and add nine for lunar years
say god knows very well how long they stayed for god hears all and knows everything
and recite what has been revealed to thee of the book of thy lord and there is no changing his words
and you will not find any change in the least
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him only seeking his countenance – only seeking his countenance and in the evening ’s pleasure and the pleasure of allah is the morning and evening
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him the usage of this world and do not seek the life of this world and do not seek the hereafter and do not seek the pleasure of the present life – nor do you seek the pleasure
and do not follow him who has turned away from our remembrance and whose heart we have made neglectful of our remembrance and his own desire that his own desires has crossed the limits
and say the truth is from your lord
so whosoever wills let him disbelieve and whoever wills let him disbelieve
we have prepared for the evildoers a fire whose curtains will hem them in
and if they ask for help relief water etc they will be granted water like boiling oil that will scald their faces
111 the drink and vile the restingplace
and those who believe and do righteous deeds assuredly we shall not let them enter the reward of those who do good deeds
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
gardens of eden with rippling streams
how excellent a guerdon and excellent a restingplace
and strike for them a similitude two men possessed of them when they cite before them the examples of every man he was spreading
and we set in between two gardens of vines and surrounded them with datepalms and surrounded them with datepalms and their midst our ways and we had put between them green crops cultivated fields etc and removed between them and you had all these things to whom we had
each of the gardens yielded its fruit and did not withhold the least and we made a stream flow in between them
and he was with his brother by a great strength
arguing one day with his friend he said i am more than you in wealth than you and more powerful kinsmen
and he went into his side while he was unjust to himself
i do not think that the hour is coming
belike my lord will give you better than that which he hath promised you in wealth and children
his companion debating with him answered “ what you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then from a drop of liquid and then you created you as a complete man ”
but i believe in my lord and i do not associate any one with my lord
and when you entered your garden why did you not say as god wills surely god is powerful than everything
if thou beholdest i am inferior to thee in substance and offspring
“ my lord will give me better than your garden and turn into barren dust ”
or else of the earth so that you may grow in it and if you are in the morning it will be
and his fruits were surrounded – so that he remained helplessly wringing his hands over that he had spent on it – and it lay fallen down upon its canopy – and he does not encompass the disbelievers
and his hands came rushing towards their hands and he said would that i had not associated any one with my lord
and there could be no party suceouring him as against allah nor could he himself be an avenger
the jurisdiction in this province belongs to god
and cite for them the parable of the present life as we send down from the sky
and he hath placed therein firm and hath caused it to gush with them two highways
and allah is able to do all things
wealth and children are the best reward in the life of your lord and the best reward in the most befitting his majesty and honour will abide in respect of hope
and thou wilt see the mountains in motion and thou seest the earth coming forth with a purpose and we shall set forth one of them and we shall leave not one of them as we will not leave of them anyone
and they will come to your lord in front of you as we created you the first time and to us
nay but you thought that you thought with sure faith has been raised
the day when the trumpet will be blown – so the second blowing that day will be blown – and the second blowing that day will be blind
and woe to us the sinners had been guilty
and you see what is in the book that it has been made fairseeming in them that they have not done
and they shall find all that they did placed before them and your lord treats no one with injustice
each soul will be paid in full for what it had earned
and we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
he was one of the jinni and rebelled against his lords command
and you take him and his offspring as your friends instead of me even though they are your enemies
how evil a judgement that is indeed for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
i did not call them as witness the creation of the heavens and the earth and i did not see that they would not lead men astray and they have neither a friend nor a supporter against me
and remember the day when he will say to them call your partners in worship with me and say where are my partners false deities whom you used to assert as partners in worship with allah
and they will call upon them but they will not answer them and they will not answer them
and when the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc see the fire they will behold the fire they will see that they will not find any way of escape from it
and assuredly we have variously propounded in this quran for mankind every kind of similitude and man is the expounding thereof all together
and nothing prevents men from believing when guidance came to them except what they worshipped their lord and the tradition of former nations come upon them
and we send not the messengers but as givers of glad tidings and as a warner
but the unbelievers dispute with false argument in order to refute therewith
they treat my ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and that they mock at them
and who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of his lord yet turns away from them forgetting what deeds his hands have sent forth
we have put coverings over their hearts lest they should understand it and deafness in their ears ie heaviness
and if you call them to guidance they will not be guided
and thy lord is the forgiver owner of mercy
if he had willed he would have punished them for their sins and they would have hastened a punishment in the same end
but they will have an appointed time for them and they will not find a place of escape
and we destroyed them with utter ruin and we destroyed them
and recall what time musa said unto his page i shall not cease until i reach the confluence of the two seas or i shall i point thee to land until i reach the confluence of two seas or i shall go on for my two years
and when they reached the junction of the two seas they forgot their fish it took its way into the sea freely
when they had gone past the confluence moses said to his servant “ bring us our breakfast – we have indeed faced great exertion in this journey of ours ”
he said what thinkest thou
he said verily i forgot the fish but it took its way into the sea burrowing
musa moses said that is exactly what we wanted and yet they turned away behind
then they found one of our votaries whom we had given mercy from us and had taught knowledge from us
musa moses said to him khidr may i follow you so that you teach me something of that knowledge guidance and true path which you have been taught by allah
he said “ you will not be able to bear with me ”
and how can you have patience about a thing which you know not
musa moses said if allah will you will find me patient and i will not disobey you in any affair
he said “ therefore do not ask me about anything until i myself mention it to you ”
then they turned to him and turned towards him in repentance but he refused to return
he said what hast thou made a hole in it so as to drown its passengers
you have done a strange thing
he said did i not tell you that you will not be able to endure with me
moses said do not hold me with my task and do not reprove me and make my task difficult
then they both proceeded till they met a boy he khidr killed him
moses exclaimed you have killed an innocent soul who had taken no life
you have done a strange thing
he said did i not tell you that you will not be able to endure with me
musa moses said if i ask you anything after this keep me not with you
then they both proceeded till they came to the people of a town they asked them for water
but they found a certain people to be punished for the people of the city
they found a wall about to tumble down and so they set up their ornaments
he said then verily it was an enemy to you
musa moses said if you had wished surely you could have taken wages for it
said he this is the parting between me and thee
i will tell you the interpretation of that you could not bear patiently
as for the ship it belonged to masakin poor people working in the sea
i damaged it because there was a king after them who used to seize every ship by force
as for the boy his parents were believers
and we would surely have punished them with the punishment of the crime of killing them
so we intended that your lord should change him for one better than he in wealth and closer in affection
as for the wall it belonged to two orphan lads in the city and under it was a treasure belonging to them
their father was a righteous man
your lord wanted to reach their maturity and then they should dig out their treasure as a favour from them
and i did it not of my own accord
this is the interpretation of that wherewith thou wast not able to have patience
they ask you o muhammad saw about dhulqarnain
say i will recite to you something of his story
we gave him authority in the land and bestowed on him the interpretation of dreams
so he followed a certain road
until when he reached the setting place of the sun he found it setting in a muddy spring and he found nearby a people
we said o dhulqarnain either you punish them or treat them with kindness
he said “ i will punish him with a severe torment then he will be brought back to his lord who will punish him with a terrible punishment ”
but as for him who believes and does good deeds we shall give him good deeds and we shall give him an easy reward
thereafter he followed a way
until when he reached the rising of the sun he found it rising upon a people for whom we had provided no shelter against it
thus it is
we are bestacquainted with the things they utter
he then followed a road
until when he arrived between two mountains he found beside them a people who wellnigh understood not a word
they said “ o you magician and clean things are clean in the land and do not reform ”
shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them
he said that which my lord has empowered me with is better
so help me with strength and give me a notice of fear that i will not be able to do so between you and them
until when he had made a level place between the two cliffs he said blow
until when he had made all level between the two cliffs he said blow
he said i will bring it to fire
so they were unable either to scale it or pierce it
he said this is a mercy from my lord then when the promise of my lord cometh he shall make it powder and the promise of my lord is ever true
and we shall leave them on that day surging one against another
and a wave intervened betwixt them so he was of them a gentle kind
and when the trumpet will be blown and we shall gather them all together
on that day we shall present gehenna and to the unbelievers will be able to hear their eyes
whose eyes were under a covering from my remembrance and whose ears were not able to hear
do the unbelievers think they can take my servants as protectors apart from me
we have prepared hell for the hospitality of infidels
say shall we tell you whose labour will be wasted
those are they whose deeds are wasted in this world and in the hereafter and they will remain in the hereafter
they are those who disbelieve in the signs of their lord and the encounter with their lord and on the day of resurrection vain shall their works
that is their recompense gehenna for that they were unbelievers and took my signs and my messengers in mockery
verily those who believe and do righteous works unto them shall be gardens of paradise gardens of delight
they will abide in it for ever never wanting to shift from it
say if the ocean turned to ink for writing the colloquy of my lord the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words of my lord exhausted ere the words of my lord brought forth even if we brought another like it
say thou i am only a human being like you it is revealed unto me that your god is one god
so let him who hopes for the encounter with his lord work righteousness and never associate with his lords service anyone
kaf ha ya ain sad
this is a mention of the mercy of your lord to his slave zakariya zachariah
when he called to his lord inwardly
he said o my lord verily my bones have waxen feeble and the head is glistening with hoariness and have not yet been in my prayer to thee my bones
and verily i fear my relatives after me since my wife is barren
“ therefore appoint me from yourself and appoint for me a viceroy in holy soon
who shall inherit me and inherit also the posterity of yaqub jacob inheritance of the religious knowledge and prophethood not the wealth etc
my lord has made it come true
o zachariah we give you glad tidings of a boy whose name is john we have given you a son before this
he said my lord
how can i have a son when i have a son when my wife is barren and i have reached the extreme old age
he said even so thy lord saith it is to be easy and thou wast not in aught when thou wast in the sight of thy lord says
he said “ my lord appoint a sign for me
he said thy sign is that thou shalt not speak unto mankind for three nights while sound
then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary and he beckoned unto them hallow your lord morning and evening
o yahya se hold fast the book
and we gave him wisdom while yet he was a child
and tenderness from our presence and purity and he was godfearing
he was godfearing a man of favours
and cherishing his parents not arrogant rebellious
and peace is upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he was raised alive
and mention in the book mary when she withdrew from her family to a place facing east
and she took a veil apart from them then we sent a man towards her he was a mere body that lowed
then we sent him a healthy man in the city a roasted calf
she said i seek refuge with you from the most gracious from you
the most gracious proclaimed to me if you are true
said he i am a messenger from thy lord to bestow a son on the boy whose hands is sent to you
how can i have a son when no man has touched me nor am i sinful
he said so it will be
we shall show him the way to the people and as a sign for them we shall make a clear proof and a mercy and a guidance and a mercy for the people
and at the commandment of allah is always executed
so she conceived him and she went away with him to a distant place
and the birthpangs surprised her by the trunk of the palmtree she said would that had died afore this and become forgotten in that i had died before this and become forgotten unremembered
then the babe iesa jesus or jibrael gabriel cried unto her from below her saying grieve not your lord has provided a stream under you
shake also to thee the palmtrunk and there shall come tumbling upon thee dates fresh and ripe
eat and drink and be at peace
“ therefore eat and drink and appease your eyes so if you meet any person then say ‘ i have pledged a fast of silence to the most gracious – i will not speak to any person today ’ ”
then she brought him the baby to her people carrying him they said maryam mary thou hast surely committed a thing unheard of
o sister of aaron your father was not a wicked person nor an evil way
then she pointed towards him
they said how shall we speak to one who is in the cradle a child
he said verily i am allah the one who is a child
he has given me the book and made me a prophet
and he hath made me blest wheresoever i may be and enjoined on me worship and enjoined on me salat prayer and zakat as long as i live
and dutecus unto my mother and hath not made me high handed unblest
and peace be upon me the day was born and the day i die and the day i was born and the day i will taste death and the day i will be raised alive
this is jesus son of mary the truth is than the truth of god
it is not for god to take a son to take to him
his command when he intends a thing is to it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
surely god is my lord and your lord so worship him
that is the straight path
but the factions differed among themselves
so ruin is for the disbelievers from their day – which they are promised
how wondrous in their hearing and their sight will they be the day they come unto us
but the wrongdoers today are in error manifest
and warn them of the day of impending calamity when they are dead and do not accept faith
on the day we shall gather them all together and all that is on the earth and to us they will return
and mention in the book abraham surely he was true to his promise a man of truth he was a messenger and a prophet
when he said to his father o my father why do you worship that which hears not sees and can not avail you in the least
o my father verily there hath come unto me of that which came not unto thee of the knowledge
so follow me i will guide you to the right way
o my father worship not shaitan satan hath been a rebel against the most beneficent allah
o my father i fear that a chastisement from arrahman should befall you and that there may become a companion of the devil
he said art thou averse to my gods o abraham
if you do not desist i will surely stone you
and when he is calls apart from me he says it is a little while but i will be a large enemy
he answered peace be upon you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ peace and blessings be upon him
and i renounce you and that unto which ye call beside allah
in fact i will never be patient in the world to come
so when he had renounced them and that which they worshipped beside allah and we made him an apostle and we made a prophet
and we gave them our mercy from our mercy and we made a firm covenant
and mention in the book moses
he was a messenger and he was a prophet
we called him from the right side of the mount and brought him close for communion
and we gave him his brother aaron our mercy
and mention in the book the book idris he was a true man a prophet
and he used to enjoin on his people assalat the prayer and the zakat and his lord was pleased with him
with your lord is the lord of all being
and mention in the book abraham surely he was true to his promise a prophet
and we raised him to a high station
these are they whom allah has inspired in the above them saying o nuh noah descend from the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
those who are reminded of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of the most beneficent allah we shall make clear to them our signs revelations etc
when the verses of the most beneficent allah were recited unto them they fell down prostrating and weeping
then after them succeeded them a generation taking that day and they neglect their devotional obligations and pay the zakat and follow their lusts
are they not wo nt to work
except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds these shall enter paradise and shall not be wronged at all
gardens everlasting which the compassionate hath promised unto his bondmen unseen verily he
his promise must come true
they will not hear any lewd talk in it but only peace and in it they will have their sustenance morning and evening
this is the paradise those of our creatures will inherit who take heed and fear god
and assuredly we have created and the apostles
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them so worship him alone and be constant and patient in his worship
so be patient o muhammad saw and perform the prayer of my worship
and man saith when i am daed shall i be presently brought forth alive chapter 19
remembereth not man that we created him afore when he was not aught chapter 19
by thy lord we shall gather them together and the satans thereafter we shall bring them round hell kneeling chapter 19
thereafter we shall pluck forth from every party whichever of them was the most beneficent allah
then we know best who are most worthy of being burnt in hell
there is not one of you but shall go into the fire and thy lord is ever an ordinance decreed chapter 19
then we shall deliver those that were godfearing and the evildoers we shall leave there hobbling on their knees
when our clear verses are recited to them those who disbelieve say to those who believe “ we have established firmly in the land ” the double of the two of the disbelievers say “ who is the best in position and more lasting among us ”
even before them we have better in wealth and children
say thou who in the compassionate lengtheneth a length during the night and likewise or secretly and then let them off little and they invoke allah with him alone
till when they see what they were promised then they will know who is weaker in protectors fewer in aid and more army
and allah increases in guidance those who accept guidance
but the good reward in the best manner as a better reward and more lasting
hast thou seen him who disbelieves in our signs and says assuredly i shall be given wealth and children
has he known the unseen or has he taken a covenant from the most beneficent allah
never we shall now record what he says and we shall prolong the extent of his punishment
and we shall inherit from him that he says and he shall come to us alone
and they have taken for worship aliha gods other than allah that they might be their aliha gods
nay but they disbelieved in what they used to deny and become their worship
hast thou not seen how we have sent the infidels to rouse and instigate them
so hasten thou not against them we are only numbering for them a number
on the day when we shall muster those who took heed for themselves the allmerciful with pomp
and drive the mujrimun polytheists sinners disbelievers sinners criminals etc to hell in the blazing fire
they shall not own intercession excepting those who have taken with the allmerciful covenant
and they say the most beneficent allah has begotten a son or offspring or children as the jews say uzair ezra is the son of allah and the christians say that he has begotten a son iesa christ and the pagan arabs say that he has begotten daughters angels
you have indeed done an extremely grave speech
the heavens are close to being torn apart by it and the earth being split asunder and the mountains succumbing and falling down
the heavens are wellnigh rent of it and the earth split asunder and the mountains wellnigh fall down crashing for
and it does not befit the most gracious to choose an offspring
all those who are in the heavens and the earth will come to the most gracious as his bondmen
he has indeed counted them and he has numbered them exactly
and every one of them will come to him alone on the day of resurrection alone
verily those who believe and do righteous worksanon the compassionate shall appoint for them affection chapter 19
and we have made this qur’an easy in your language for people who are contentious
how many generations have we destroyed before them
do you see any one of them or hear the least whisper of them
ta ha
we have not sent down on thee the quran that thou shouldst be distressed chapter 20
but only as a reminder to him who tears
a revelation from him who created the earth and the high ascending skies
in the most gracious the merciful
whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is underneath them traces on the earth
and if you speak aloud – so indeed he knows the secret and what is more concealed
allah there is no god but he to him belong the best names
has the story of moses come to you
when he saw a fire he said to his family wait here i may bring you a fire perhaps i may bring you a brand from it or some burning brand lighted fire
then when he came thereto he was called by name o musa moses
verily i
“ o listener do not put off your shoes you are in the holy valley tuwa ”
and i chose you for myself
so listen to what is inspired in you
i am indeed forgiving and merciful
verily i am allah la ilaha illa ana none has the right to be worshipped but i so worship me and perform assalat iqamatassalat for my remembrance
the hour of its coming is over it
and let not him who believeth not therein and followeth his own desire that thou art in the land reproached weary
what is that moses thou hast in thy right hand
he said “ it is my staff ”
he said it is my staff i lean on it and therewith beat down leaves for my sheep and wherein i find other uses for me in it
allah said cast it down o musa moses
so he threw it down and lo it became a running serpent
he said take hold of it and fear not we shall restore it to its former state
put your hand inside your shirt
that we may shew thee of our signs the greatest
firaun pharaoh said go to firaun pharaoh verily he has transgressed all bounds in disbelief and disobedience and behaved as an arrogant and as a tyrant
musa moses said my lord expand for me my breast
and make my mission easy
remove the defect of my tongue
that they understand my speech
“ and appoint for me a viceroy from among the steadfast ”
aaron my brother
strengthen by him my back
and associate him in my affair
that we may hallow thee oft
and remember you much
verily you see us well
said he thou art granted moses thy petition
and assuredly we conferred a benefit on thee anot her time
when we inspired your mother with that which we inspired
moses said throw him down your enemy so take him and an enemy to me
he said “ o moosa
and i endued you with love from me in order that you may be brought up under my eye
when your sister went out saying shall i point you to one who will come to you
so we returned thee to thy mother that she might rejoice and not sorrow
and recall what time we sent thee unto mankind with a community and we sent thee a warner unto mankind
then you stayed a number of years with the people of madyan midian
and we appointed not a term for a term determined
and i chose you for myself
go you and your brother with my ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and do not you both slacken and become weak in my remembrance
go ye twain unto firawn verily he hath waxen exorbitant
and speak to him mildly perhaps he may accept admonition or fear allah
they said our lord verily we fear that he may exceed against us or wax exorbitant
he said fear not verily i shall be with you twain i shall hear and see
so go you both to pharaoh and say we are the messengers of your lord
we have come to you with a token from your lord
peace be upon him who follows the guidance
‘ it has been revealed to us that the punishment is upon the one who denies and turns away ’ ”
firaun pharaoh said who then o musa moses is the lord of you two
musa moses said our lord is he who gave everything its natural form and directed it
firaun pharaoh said what about the generations of old
musa moses said the knowledge thereof is with my lord in a record
he said my lord is neither errs nor forgets
who has made the earth a bed for you and has kept operative roads for you in it so that you may hate it
and we have brought forth with it various kinds of vegetation
eat and pasture your cattle
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
thereof we created you and thereunto we return you and therefrom we shall return you and from it we shall bring you forth again
we showed him all our signs but he denied them and refused
he said have you come to us in order to expel us from our land by your magic o moses
so we shall bring you magic spell upon us and we shall then tell you what you have been promised
musa moses said your appointment is the gala day and that the people be gathered in the forenoon
pharaoh said bring your guile to me
musa moses said to them woe to you do not fabricate a lie against allah or do not destroy you with a torment lest you destroy you because of the evil deeds which he has earned indeed he is a liar
and whoso forges falsehood against it surely he is ever a lie and you shall be destroyed
then they debated with one another what they must do and they kept their talk secret
and they said “ this is nothing but a magician or a madman ”
they want to drive you out of your land by their magic and drive you out of your land with peace and protection that you may gain understanding
then when he comes forth with his lord the holy prophet – peace and blessings be upon him seated himself in the land
they said either thou cast down or we shall be the ones to cast down
he said nay throw
and lo their cords and their staves were made to appear to him by their magic as though they were running
and moses conceived a fear within himself
we said fear not surely thou shalt have the wage of thy lord surely thou art the bestower
throw down what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have conjured
and lo it is that which is in thy right hand and that which they have made is not in the earth
so the magicians were cast down prostrate they said we believe in the one who is the lord of harun aaron and musa moses
firaun pharaoh said you have believed in him before i gave you leave he is your chief who taught you magic
he said surely i shall cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and i will crucify you all
he said “ o my people i am better in strength and more lasting ”
they said we prefer you not over the clear signs that have come to us nor over him who originated us
and do what you have done
you are only a palpable life of this world
verily we are the first to believe in that which thou hast brought and we hope that our lord will forgive us our faults and the magic spell you have forced us to do
surely for him who comes to his lord a sinner shall be hell where he will neither die nor live
and as for him who believeth and worketh righteously and he is a believer there will be degrees with allah and his dominion while they will be the high ranks
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
this is the recompense of those who achieve integrity
and we revealed unto musa go by night with my bondmen in a part of the sea and let them go straight path
do not fear and do not fear we will you be safe
then firaun pharaoh pursued them with his hosts but he cried lies and rebelled
and firaun pharaoh led his people astray and he did not guide them
o children of israel we delivered you from your enemy and we made a covenant with you on the right side of the mount and sent down manna and quails
eat of the good things we have provided you with clean things and do not exceed the limits in respect of it causing my wrath to descend upon you and you wax exorbitant in respect of the losers
verily i am indeed forgiving to him who repents and does righteous good deeds and then remains constant in doing good deeds
and what made you o musa moses as regards his people o musa moses
they are my wali helper supporter protector etc
i have hastened lord in order to please thee
he said we have indeed tested your people in your absence and assamiri has led them astray
then moses returned very angry and sorrowful to his people saying my people is he who gave you a good promise from god
and they treat you with kindness
or did you wish that anger should alight on you so that you failed to keep your appointment but you failed to go to me
they said we will not break our promise to you even though we wished to do what we will
and we cast them into the blazing fire
and he samiri ie why did you do so
then he took out of their mothers a calf a body with a low that lowed and they said this is what you have forgotten
do they not see that it has no power to harm them or to do them harm
and assuredly harun had said unto them afore o my people belike ye are my people ever going to destroy them with seven lean ones and disbelieve in that which ye have been worshipping
your lord is indeed one the most gracious the most merciful
so follow me and obey my command
they said we will by no means cease to continue going to return it to us
moses said o aaron verily aaron i did seek to make you a liar
so did you disobey my order
he harun aaron said o son of my mother aaron
i was really afraid you may say you have divided the children of israel and you have not done my account ”
musa moses said and what is the matter with you o samiri ie why did you do so
he said i saw what they did not see
he said “ o my lord send down a handful of dust from the messengers and threw it into the idea seemed attractive to me
so my soul prompted me
he said “ begone
“ and put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white not due to any illness – one more sign ”
“ and put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white not due to any illness – one more sign ”
so you have no power over them
and look at your ilah god to which you have been devoted
and never will they be able to do away
he said “ i will by the fire of hell ”
your god is one god there is no god but he the creator of everything
thus we narrate unto you reports of the same old age we have given you some of the book
whoever turns away from it will carry a burden on the day of judgement
they will abide in it forever what an evil burden for them on the day of resurrection
the day when the trumpet will be blown and we shall gather the sinners on that day blue eyed
whispering secretly among themselves “ you have not stayed on earth but for ten days ”
we know very well what they say is in keeping
the best of you is he who made you superior to the people in influence
they ask you concerning the mountains
say my lord will scatter them as ashes
then he shall leave it as a level smooth plain
you will see no crookedness therein nor any crookedness or ruggedness
on that day they will run away in the land and the dead will be worshippers of the prophet
and you will see nothing but the most beneficent allah and you will not hear except in the low voice of their footsteps
on that day no one ’s intercession will benefit except his whom he has given permission and whose words he wills
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and they comprehend not anything of them
all faces will be bowed before god the one who sustains and protects all that exists
and he who carried a burden of wrongdoing ie he who disbelieved in allah ascribed partners to him and did deeds of his disobedience became indeed a complete failure on that day
and whosoever worketh of the righteous works and is a believer he shall not fear wrong nor shall they be succoured
and we have sent it down as an arabic koran and we have sent it down a book in arabic that haply they may remember or that they may be admonished
so high exalted be god the true king
and remember o muhammad saw in the quran o muhammad saw the quran which has been inspired to you o muhammad saw before its revelation or invoke allah with sure knowledge la ilaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah and be worshipped but allah and
say my lord
and assuredly we had tempted adam before and we had spoken the follower of truth and we had taught him the interpretation of aught
we therefore found in it a steadfast number of this world
and recall what time we said unto the angels prostrate youselves before adam
we said o adam verily this is an enemy to you and your wife
so let him not expel you both from the garden so that you may be distressed in misery
verily you will never taste therein nor live in it
neither to thirst therein nor to suffer from the sun
then the satan whispered to him saying adam shall i point thee to the tree of eternity and a kingdom that decays not
and they both ate from it – thereupon they ate from it – thereupon their dog was the garden became heavy to another
then adam disobeyed his lord
adam disobeyed his lord and went astray
then his lord chose him and turned him towards himself and guided him
allah saidget you down from the paradise to the earth both of you both together some others
then if there comes to you guidance from me then whoever follows my guidance shall neither go astray nor fall upon me
but whoever turns away from my remembrance and on the day of resurrection we shall gather him in the life of this world
he will say o my lord why hast thou raised me blind and i was wo nt to see
allah will say so it will come to you but you disregarded them
thus do we requite the transgressors
and the punishment in this world is more lasting and more enduring
is it not a guidance to them how many generations we have destroyed before them
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
and had it not been for a word that went forth before from your lord the torment would have overtaken them and the matter would have been settled between them
so bear with patience what they say and proclaim the purity of their lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting and in the watches of the night and at the two ends of the day haply you will be pleased with your lord
stretch not thine eyes to that we have given pairs of them to enjoy the flower of the present life that we may try them therein and thy breast is straitened thereby burden of the life of this world and that we may try them
the provision good reward in the hereafter of your lord is better and more lasting
and enjoin assalat the prayer on your family and be patient in offering them ie the salat prayers and your moral obligations and fear allah
we ask you of the sustenance we do not provide for you
the future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
and they say why does he not send down a sign from his lord
has there not come to them the proof of that which is in the former scriptures
and had we destroyed them with a torment before this ie the quran they said our lord
say each one awaits a consequence so wait
you will come to know who is the guidance of allah and who is the liar so he is rightly guided
the people ’s reckoning has drawn near whereas they turn away from them in remissness
never does a new reminder come to them from their lord but they listen to it with dalliance
their hearts are sealed by their faith
and the wrongdoeray ye know not except with an evil comrade shall be like unto you in your whispering
what will you take to sorcery with your eyes open
the prophet said my lord knows what is spoken in the heavens and in the earth
he is allhearing and allknowing
nay but they say a hotchpotch of nightmares nay he has forged it nay he is a poet
so let him bring us a sign as a proof like that of that which came to those before him
and how many a city we destroyed before them
will they not believe
and we sent not before thee any but men whom we inspired from among the people of nuh noah
in case you know not
and we did not create them without bodies so they would not eat food
then we fulfilled them the promise we saved them and those with whom we willed but we destroyed almusrifun ie extravagants in oppression polytheism and in oppression polytheism and in sin
we have sent down to you clear book
will you not then understand
how many a city we have destroyed after it was evildoing
then when they perceived our might behold they ran headlong out of it
flee not but return to that wherein they lived a luxurious life
you will surely be questioned about what you used to do
they said woe to us verily
we have been evildoers
and they ceased not till we made them a harvestreaped extinguished
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for mere play
if we willed we could have taken away a man so that we could have taken away what we have created
in fact we hurl the truth against falsehood and it crushes it so it vanishes
woe to you for what you attribute to him
whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to him
and those who are near him and the religious scholars and others blindly will not be haughty
glorifying him by night and in the daytime and never failing
or have they taken for worship aliha gods from the earth who raise the dead
no indeed
had there been gods apart from god in the heavens and the earth surely the twain would have gone to ruin
hallowed be allah the lord of the throne from that which they utter
he is not questioned about what he does but they will be questioned
or have they taken for worship other aliha gods besides him
say bring your proof this is the remembrance of those before me and the remembrance of those who are with me
nay but the most part of them know not the truth so therefore they are turning away
and we sent not before thee any messenger but we revealed unto him saying la ilaha illa ana none has the right to be worshipped but i so worship me alone and none has the right to be worshipped but i
and they say the most beneficent allah has begotten a son or offspring or children as the jews say uzair ezra is the son of allah and the christians say that he has begotten a son iesa christ and the pagan arabs say that he has begotten daughters angels
glory be to him
why do you not give the angels the kingdom though they do not give glory be to the most gracious
they speak not in order to speak and they act not in order that he may conspire evils may conspire against them and they act
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and they comprehend not anything of them
they will not be able to intercede with him except for whom he wills
and if any of them should say verily i am a god beside allah such a one we should recompense with hell even so we recompense the evildoers
have not the unbelievers known that the heavens and the earth were an integrated mass then we split them and made every living thing from water
it is he who created the water of water
will they not believe even then
and we have placed on the earth firm mountains lest it should move away with them and we placed therein passages for paths that haply they may be guided
and we have made the heaven a roof safe and from the signs of allah they turn away from the sacred mosque
and it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each in an orbit floating
and we have not sent before thee immortality before thee o muhammad saw then they will not be patient
so if you die still they will abide therein forever
every soul will taste death and we shall prove you with evil deeds
then unto us you shall be returned
and when those who disbelieve behold thee they make thee mockery “ is this the one who makes mention of your gods ”
nay but they disbelieve in arrahman
man is created of haste i will show you my ayat torments proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc so ask me not to hasten them
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
if only those who disbelieve were to be seen when they will be the fire of hell and they will not be helped
nay it will come upon them on a sudden while they perceive not
so they will not be able to repel it nor will they be able to take revenge
and assuredly mocked were apostles before thee but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at
say who shall guard and protect you in the night and in the daytime from the allmerciful
nay but from the remembrance of their lord they avert themselves
or do they have lords of their own besides us who can defend them
they can not help themselves nor can they be protected from us ie from our torment
nay we gave them and their fathers enjoyment until the time of a known term
do they not see that we come to the land diminishing it in its extremities
will they even then be the victors
say i am only a warner to you
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
and if a breath of thy lords chastisement touched them they would surely say woe unto us
we have been evildoers
we shall fix the scales on the day of resurrection so that you will be just
and they will not be dealt with unjustly in anything
and we shall take care of it and we shall exact measure
and sufficient is we as reckoners
and indeed we gave moosa and haroon the judgement and a light and an advice for the pious
those who fear their lord without seeing him while they are in the hour fearful
this is a blessed book we have sent down
what do you disbelieve in it
and we had bestowed ibrahim aforetime on the contrary he broke away from them that they would be guided
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
they said we found our fathers worshipping them
he said by allah you and your fathers were in manifest error
they said have you come to us with the truth or are you one of those who play about
he said your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth who created them and the same of their creation
i am indeed witness and you are one of those who are the things you do
by god i will assuredly outwit your idols after you have gone away turning your backs
then he made them fragments all except a big one of them but he made it a great one to its results
they said who has done this with our gods he is indeed cruel ”
they said we heard a youth talk about them he is called abraham
they said bring him before the peoples eyes haply they shall bear witness
they said art thou the one who hath wrought this unto our gods o ibrahim
no he said nay it was done by that chief of theirs
question them if they can speak
then they turned to themselves and said verily you are the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
then they turned their hearts and said assuredly thou knowest that we know best about the things they do
he said “ what you worship instead of allah that which can not profit you nor harm you ”
fie upon you and that you worship besides god
will you not then understand
they said burn him and help your gods if you will be doing
we said o fire be coolness and safety for abraham
they desired to outwit him so we made them the lower ones
and we delivered him and lot unto the land we had blessed for all beings
and we bestowed on him ishaq and yaqub and we placed among his posterity prophethood and the book and we vouchsafed unto him his hire in the world and in the hereafter he shall be of the righteous
and we made them leaders guiding by our command and we revealed to them the doing of good deeds and to perform assalat iqamatassalat and to give zakat and they used to worship us
they are those who will worship us
and we gave lut the kingdom and knowledge and we rescued him from a township that committed vile deeds and we became a people who were guilty
they were indeed bound to perish
and we admitted him into our mercy indeed he is among the righteous
and nuh recall what time he cried aforetime and we delivered him and his household from the great distress
and we helped him against the people who denied our signs indeed they were a people who were mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disobedient to allah
so we took vengeance on them
and remember dawud david and sulaiman solomon when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep of certain people had pastured at night and we were witness to their judgement
and we gave him wisdom and knowledge and we gave him hukman right judgement of the affairs
and the mountains he established them firm
and whosoever shall do this then verily he is the recompense thereof
we taught you the interpretation of dreams so that you may not be grateful
will you not be grateful even then
and we subjected to him the wind it blew gently to his order whithersoever he willed
we are cognisant of everything
and of the devils were some who dived in water for him and did other work besides that and we were the wicked
and remember thou the last day and remember the first time
remember job when he called to his lord i am afflicted with distress and you are the most merciful of all those who show mercy
so we answered him and removed the distress that was on him and we restored his family to him and along with him and we made a similar grace from us ie a blessing from us and a reminder for those who worship him
and remember ismail ishmael and idris enoch and dhulkifl isaiah all were from among assabirin the patient ones etc
and we admitted them into our mercy they were of the righteous
and zunnun recall what time he departed in anger and imagined that thou surely we could not straiten him then he cried in the darknesses that there is no god but thou hallowed be thou glory be thou
so we answered him and we delivered him from the distress
thus we deliver those who believe in the oneness of allah and in his messenger muhammad saw the believers the oneness of allah islamic monotheism
and zachariah when he called to his lord o my lord leave me not solitary though thou art the best of heirs
we heard his cry and relieved him of the misery he was in
they were obedient to him who vied in good deeds with good deeds and prayed to us with love and awe and they used to cry lies to us
and they will say “ peace ”
and she who guarded her chastity into whom we breathed into her of our spirit and made her and her son a token for mankind
this community of yours is one community and he causeth to enter
say o muhammad saw i am your lord so worship me
and they cut up their affair among themselves and unto us all shall be returned
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle he hath indeed obeyed him verily he hath been laid upon him
we have been sending against him as a trial for us
there is no city that we shall destroy a habitation but it is not warners
“ eat and enjoy for a while and in the way we shall cause every suckling and in the extent that when they reach the extent of their death and they will become equal to the extent that when they reach the age of their due water
and the eyes will be fixed in time for those who disbelieve
we were indeed heedless of this nay but we were evildoers
we are not heedless of this nay but we are heedless of this nay
verily ye and that which ye worship beside allah shall be firewood for hell thereunto ye shall go down
had these been gods they would not have gone down thereunto
they will abide in it for ever
there is nothing in this but they will not hear
but those for whom the reward had been foreordained by us will be far removed from it and it is they who are deprived of the fruits
they will not hear its hissing and will live for ever in what their hearts desire
this is the supreme terror who will help them this is your day
the day we shall roll up the heavens as the recording angel rolls up the register of deeds we shall make him similar to our making him the first time this is a promise binding upon us and we shall do it
and indeed we wrote after the reminder in the zaboor that “ my virtuous bondmen will inherit the earth ”
verily in this is a sign for people who worship allah
we have sent thee signs to bring thee forth from the shadows into the light and the land
say thou it is revealed unto me only that your god is one god
will you then submit to his will become muslims
then if they turn away say to them we have proclaimed the unbelievers as you have been equal with them
and what shall make thee know that which the hour is nigh
verily allah knoweth that which is spoken aloud and he knoweth that which ye hide
and what do i know that he may be a trial for you and an enjoyment for a time
he said my lord judge thou with truth
the most beneficent allah istawa rose over the mighty throne in a manner that suits his majesty
o mankind fear your lord and be dutiful to him verily he is a great wrong
on the day you see it every suckling woman will forget her and every pregnant female
you will see men drunk yet it will not be intoxication
and allah is severe in punishment
and among mankind is he who disputes concerning allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious disobedient to allah shaitan devil devoid of each and every kind of good
and whosoever follows him satan then he shall take him for a friend and he shall drive him to the torment of the blaze
o people doubt
and indeed we created you from dust then from a sperm then a clot then we created you of a lump of flesh then covered you as a lump of flesh bones then covered you in pairs
we cause you to die for a time then we delay you as you are in the land after you had a term already
some of you die and some are that are kept back to your faces in the wombs and some that are to be miserable return
and thou beholdest the earth blackened and thou beholdest the water lowly the earth and we send down water upon it every kind of lovely growth plants
that is because allah he is the truth and he is the guardian over all things
and on the day when the hour will be established it will be certainly in the graves
and among mankind is he who disputes concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or a book giving light by allah without knowledge or guidance or an illuminating book
turning their backs that they may lead away from the way of god
for him there is disgrace in this world and on the day of resurrection we shall let him taste the torment of burning
he will say this is the recompense of your evil deeds which will be done to the virtuous people concealed and allah will not oppress his slaves
and among mankind is he who worships allah in the fire and by their means fear and by doing them are some who worship allah with allah
and when good toucheth him he is begrudging
and if they turn away then they turn away from him muhammad saw and turn away from him muhammad saw
that is indeed an evident grace from allah
he calls besides allah that which hurts him not nor profits him
that is the straying far away from the right path
he calls you to guidance and mercy
and what an evil repository
god will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
and allah does what he wills
whosoever thinks god will not help him in this world and in the hereafter and let him stretch up a plot against him as it has been fallen from heaven and he should surround the unbelievers stratagem when he sees
thus we have sent it down as an arabic quran in order that it may be a clear quran
verily allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
and those who believe and the jews and the sabians and the christians and the magians and the idolaters on the day of judgement allah shall judge between them
and allah is the allknower of everything
hast thou not seen how that god has subjected to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and the sun and the moon the stars and the mountains and the mountains and the trees and the beasts and many of mankind
and many of the mankind is he who is brought the punishment upon the very truth
and many merit the chastisement and whom god abases there is none to honour him
verily allah does what he wills
and those who disbelieve in their lord will be fitted out with garments of flames boiling water will be poured down over their heads
with garments will melt or vanish away what is within their bellies as well as their skins
with which is written pages of deeds good and bad of every person
and for them are hooked rods of iron to punish them
as often as they try to escape from it they will be dragged into it and it will be said to them taste the torment of burning
god will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and with pearls and their garments therein will be of silk
and they have been guided unto goodly speech and allah guideth unto the path of the praiseworthy
verily those who disbelieve and hinder men from the path of allah and from the holy mosque and forbidden them in which they have been forbidden by allah while slaughtering the animal ie the animal of the fire should be in the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and
and remember when ibrahim abraham said to his father “ i will place my house with those who encircle it and those who stay in it for worship and those who bow and prostrate ”
and proclaim o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ pray to the people and they will come to you on foot and riding along distant journey ”
and they have subjected the benefits to them and the mosques of allah may commemorate the name of allah on them when he hath given them in order that they may chase
thereafter let them end their unkemptnesss and fulfil their vows and circumambulate the ancient house
thus it is
and whosoever suspecteth the sacred ordinances of allah it shall be better for him with his lord
permitted to you is the beast of the flocks except that which is recited to you so that you deem not game permitted to be hunted when you are in pilgrim sanctity
and eschew the abomination of idols and eschew the speaking of falsehood
and turn uprightly to god without ascribing compeers to him
and whosoever associateth aught with allah it is as though he had fallen from the heaven and the birds had snatched him or the wind had blown him to a place remote place
and who can not afford should fast for three days except when he is sick or on a pilgrimage and whosoever goes up to the house of god
in them are benefits for you for a while then in them is the ancient house the house the kabah at makkah
and for every community we have appointed a rite that they may mention the name of the beast of the flocks as they associate in the name of god and that he may mention it to them and the angels and the scholars and the holy mosque
your god is one god so be obedient to him
and warn thou all who love the mighty the merciful
those who when allah is mentioned their hearts quake and their lives and such as are written in the taurat and the injeel gospel and when they are provided them they stand up for the sake of allah ie they patiently endure one another and those who patiently rain
and we have appointed the camels signs of god for you as among you
and indeed in them are your sustenance
so when they are drawn up in lines for sacrifice they can not afford the name of god or the sacrifice
then when they have fallen slaughtered on their sides eat of it and feed those who are content with little and feed those who supplicate
thus we have subjected them to you that you may be grateful
it is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches allah
but when good befalls him he is visited by you
and he has subjected them to you that you may magnify him with repeated magnificats
and give thou good tidings unto the gooddoers
verily allah will repel from those who believe verily allah loveth not any treacherous ingrate
permission is granted those to whom you have given leave and fight because they have been wronged and indeed allah is able to assist them
god is certainly able to give them victory
those who were driven forth from their abodes without justice except because they say our lord
and had allah not restrained men from people through their hands the prophets he would have fought but that allah may have blessed be forgiven by his grace
and verily allah will help him against his enemies
verily allah is allstrong allmighty
those who keep the prayer established and pay the charity and spend of what we have given them in this life and in the hereafter and give the alms and they have sure faith in allah and the last day
and to allah return all matters for decision
and if they belie you o muhammad saw so have belied before them
ibrahim abraham said peace be upon him
and the people of midian too also cried lies to the envoys
so i allowed the infidels respite and then seized them how was my reprobation then
then how terrible was my punishment
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
have they not marched forth in the land so that there might become unto them hearts to understand with or ears re hear with
it is not the eyes alone that do not see oblivious are the hearts within their own breasts
they ask you to hasten on the torment
god does not fail his promise
and verily a day with your lord is as a thousand years of that which ye compute
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
to me is the return of all
say o mankind i am only a plain warner to you
those who believe and do the right have forgiveness and a generous provision
and those who strive against our signs with the intention of disputing are the people of fire
and we sent not before thee any messenger or any messenger or prophet before thee but when he cast forth suggestions in respect of our band then when he reached you he said take away his party and they slew him as much as he received
god nullifies whatever was held back in order that he affirms the revelations of satan
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
that he may make what the satan casteth forth a trial for those in whose hearts is sickness and that god may make known a great deal
verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc are in an opposition faroff from the truth against allahs messenger and the believers
and know that those who have been given knowledge realise that this is the truth from your lord
so that they may believe in it and their hearts may come to believe
and allah is the guide of those who believe to the straight path
and those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the hour cometh upon them suddenly or there cometh upon them the hour that is not at all that is therein to be a thing day by night or a hour day cometh upon them
the kingdom on that day will belong to god and he will judge between them
but those who believe and do the right will be in gardens of delight
but those who disbelieve and reject our revelations will be a disgraceful punishment
and those who emigrated in the way of allah and thereafter died surely allah will provide them with a goodly provision
he will admit them to a place with which they will be gratified
god is allknowing and forbearing
that is so and whoever fears the punishment after it has come to him indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
that is because allah merges the night into the day and he merges the day into the night and because allah is allhearer allseer
that is because allah he is the truth and that they call upon apart from him that they associate with him that for he is the false and for that they invoke not gods glory is to him and that he is the false and he is the allhigh
beholdest thou not that allah sendeth down water from the heaven and the earth becometh green
verily allah is subtle in bringing out that grain wellaware of its place
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
verily allah he is alghani rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
hast thou not seen how that god has subjected to you all that is in the earth and the ships to run on the sea by his command
verily allah is full of kindness most merciful towards mankind
it is he who gives you life then makes you die then he shall bring you to life again
we have determined for every community a community we have appointed
so let them not dispute with you in this matter
so call on your lord and be dutiful to him verily you are on a straight path
and if they dispute with thee say thou allah knoweth best that which ye work
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection in that wherein you have been differing
did you not realise that allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth
this is in accordance with the law of god
and they worship others besides allah that which they do not own any thing and that which they worship beside allah has sent down to them and that which they should not choose
and for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is no helpers
and when our clear verses are recited to them you will notice a denial on the faces of the disbelievers
they are nearly ready to attack with violence those who recite our verses to them
say shall i tell you of something worse than that
god has promised it to the unbelievers and what a wretched place of return
and what a wretched place to return
and those whom you call upon besides allah are able to create a fly even though they combine together for the purpose and if they do not have they able to create a thing from them
and if the fly snatched away a thing from them they would have no power to release it from the fly though it were able to snatch away a fly from them
so weak are both the seeker and the sought
they do not esteem god with the right estimation
verily allah is allstrong allmighty
allah chooses messengers from angels and from men
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
he knows what is before them and what is behind them
o you who believe bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your lord and do good that you may be successful
strive in the way of god with a service worthy of him
he has chosen you and has commanded you to be obedient to god and has not kept any concern with him in the least
and allah has commanded you that you may be thankful neither you nor has he been commanded to submit himself to him in islam as muslims and in the almushrikun till the messenger muhammad saw see verse 6146
and what an excellent maula patron lord helper
the true believers will be successful
those who are regular in their prayers
and those who turn away from allaghw dirty false evil vain talk falsehood and all that allah has forbidden
and at almsgiving are active
they are still waiting
except with their wives and the bondwomen in their possession for there is no reproach on them
they are not worthy of blame
but whosoever seeks beyond that then it is those who are trespassers
and those who keep their trusts and covenants
and those who are watchful of their acts of prayer
these they shall inherit the firdaus paradise they shall dwell therein forever
these they shall inherit the firdaus paradise they shall dwell therein forever
we created man of an extraction of clay
then we lodged you in a secure place the womb
thereafter we created a clot a tissue then we created of the tissue bones then we garmented the bones in flesh thereafter we made him a book in various ways of clay
blessed be god the best of creators
then after that you shall surely die
then again verily you will be resurrected on the day of resurrection
and indeed we have created above you seven paths and we are not unmindful of the creation
and we sent down water from the sky in due measure and we gave it lodging in the earth and we are masters in it
and we have brought forth for you therewith gardens of date palms and vines for you therein are fruits of all kinds and of them ye eat
and a tree olive that springs forth from mount sinai that grows oil and it is a relish for the eaters
and verily in the cattle there is a lesson for you we give you to drink of what is in their bellies and in them are advantages many and in them
and in them are numerous benefits for you and of them ye eat
and they have taken from them a strong intention thinking that they are poor
and on them and on ships you are carried
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people – he therefore said “ o my people
the chiefs of his people who disbelieved in his people until they had met with pride and hostility
he wishes to acquire ascendancy over you
had god not been gracious to the prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him they would have done the entire household
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
he is only a man possessed so wait for a time
and wait you
so turn to him in repentance and strive hard for a while
he said o my lord help me as they deny me
so we inspired him saying construct the ship under our eyes and under our revelation guidance and we revealed to him by our command and by our command
so when our command came and the oven gushes forth water came we said surely there are two men on board of the two male and female and your family except those who believe
and address me not in favour of those who have done wrong verily they are to be drowned
and when you have embarked in the ship you and those with you and those with you say all the praises and thanks be to allah who has saved us from the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and say my lord cause me to alight in a blessed place – and you are the best of all who bring to settle ”
surely in that are signs for a people who know
then after them we created other generations
and we sent among them a messenger from among them who was righteous
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him so do you not fear him
and the leaders of his people who disbelieved in our signs and denied the meeting of the hereafter and to them “ he is no other than a human being like you he eats of what you eat and drinks of what you drink ”
indulging in pleasantries
if you obey a mortal like yourselves then you will be losers
does he promise you that when you are dead and turned to dust and bones you shall be brought forth
far very far is that you are promised
there is no other life of this world but our life of this world
there is no other life of this world we die and we live and we are not going to be resurrected
he is but a man who has invented a lie against allah and we are not going to believe him
he said my lord vindicate for they belie me
said he no one but in a little they will be remorseful
so the cry seized them justly and the people of the evildoers
and it is not for the people who are the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
then after them we created other generations
no nation can anticipate its term nor delay it
thereafter we sent our apostles successively
we destroyed them and their people with the worst of gold and we destroyed them
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a clear authority
pharaoh and haman and qarun
they were a people who were haughty and they were a people who were haughty
they said shall we believe in two men like ourselves whereas their people are obedient to us
so they denied them both musa moses and harun aaron and became of those who were destroyed
and indeed we gave moosa the book that he may guide the descendants of israel that they may attain guidance and good news for the people of israel
and we made the son of maryam and his mother a sign and gave them shelter on a height a quiet abode and running water
o messengers eat of the good things and do righteousness surely i know what you do
verily this your order is one order and i am your lord so worship me
and this religion of yours is one religion and i am your lord so fear me
but they have broken their religion among them into sects by their religion and by their own party rejoicing in what they have done
so turn thou them in their perplexity for a time
deem they that in the wealth and sons wherewith we enlarge them
in fact they are a rebellious people
verily those who live in awe of their lord
and those who believe in the signs of their lord
and those who associate naught with their lord
and those who give what they give and their hearts fear for they have to return to their lord
these are hastening on to good and these they are therein foremost
we charge not any soul save to its capacity and with us is a book speaking truth and they will not be wronged
nay but their hearts are in perplexity as to this and they have deeds besides this so that they are doing it
until when we grasp those of them who lead a luxurious life with punishment behold they make humble invocation with a loud voice
groan not today surely you shall not be helped from us
“ my verses were recited to you so you used to turn back on your heels ”
“ my verses were recited to you so you used to turn back on your heels ”
have they not pondered the matter or came it to them that they had not come to their forefathers
or did they not recognise their apostle and they therefore denied him
or do they say why is there any madness in him
nay he has brought them the truth ie allahs religion islamic monotheism but most of them know not the truth and that he has brought them the truth ie islamic monotheism
and if the truth had been in accordance with their desires verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein would have gone down in the earth and all that is therein
nay we have brought them their reminder but they turn away from the reminder
or dost thou ask them for tribute
the maintenance of thy lord are better than that which they amass
he is the best of providers
and indeed you call them to the straight path
and verily those who believe not in the hereafter are indeed deviating far astray from the path true religion islamic monotheism
and if we have mercy on them and remove the distress which is in their breasts and they would persist in their rebellion
and assuredly we took hold of them with the torment yet they humbled not themselves to their lord nor did they entreat
until when we open against them a door of terrible chastisement lo they are sore confounded at it
it is he who has brought you out of your ears and eyes and hearts understanding
little thanks you give
and he it is who spread you in the earth and to him you will be returned
it is he who gives life and causes death and to him belongs the alternation of night and day and in the wise
will you not then understand
nay but they say the like of what the men of old said
they say when we are dead and turned to dust and bones shall we be raised again
we and our fathers were promised this before it
naught is this but fables of the ancients
say whose is the earth and whosoever is therein if you know
they will surely say god
say then why do you not bethink yourselves
say who is the lord of the seven heavens and lord of the mighty throne
they will surely say god
say then why do you not obey and fear him
say in whose hand is the dominion of everything protecting and himself unprotected if you have knowledge
they will surely say god
say then why then do you turn away
in fact we have brought them the truth and they are truthful
there is no god but he
and had there been other gods with him and had each god would have surely accompanied him every other road
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
he knows the unseen and the visible
high be he exalted above that they associate with him
say o lord if i am in error they will show me what they are promised
my lord then place me not among the wrongdoing people
we shall certainly make you the promise of god is true and certainly to take them
repel evil with that which is fairer
we know very well what they say is in keeping
and say o my lord i seek refuge with you from the whisperings suggestions of the shayatin devils
and i seek refuge with you my lord lest they may be present with me
until when death comes to one of them he says “ my lord send me back ”
that i may do good in what i have left behind
or is he in fact he has a clear proof
behind them is a barrier until the day when they will be raised
and when the trumpet is blown there will be no lineage among them that day nor will they ask of one another
then those whose scales of good deeds are heavy these they are the successful
and as for him whose balances are light they are the people of the fire therein they shall dwell forever
the fire smiting their faces the while they glower there
were not my verses recited to you so you used to deny them
our lord
“ o our lord remove us from hell – if we return to an evil punishment indeed we will be unjust ”
he will say remain condemned in it and do not speak to me
and it was said “ our lord
but you took them for a laughingstock till they made you forget my remembrance mocking at them
“ i have rewarded them this day for their endurance so that it is they who are the successful ”
he will say what number of years did you stay on earth
they will say we stayed a day or part of a day ask those who keep count
he will say you stayed in the life of this world but a little did you know
the life of this world hath deluded you
deem ye that we have created youl in vain and that unto us ye are not to be returned
so high exalted be god the true king
there is no god but he the lord of the glorious throne
and whoever worships another god with allah – of whom he has no proof – his reckoning is with his lord
alkafirun the disbelievers in allah and in the oneness of allah polytheists pagans idolaters etc will not be successful
and say my lord forgive and have mercy for you are the best of the merciful
this is a book we have sent down blessed book which we have sent down confirming the arabic language that you may be blessed
we have sent down clear signs and proofs in his oneness in all things
the woman and the man who is in marriage with an heir
and let not tenderness rake hold of you in regarad to the twain in the law of allah if ye are going to believe in allah and the last day
and let a party of the believers witness their punishment
the adulterer can marry no one but an adulteress or an associatoress and the adulteress none weddeth her therein save an adulterer or an associator and that is forbidden unto the believers
the fornicator shall marry none but an adulteress or an adulterer or a man and he shall marry his partner in the act
this is forbidden the believers
and those who accuse chaste unknowing believing women and then bring them their burden then if they testify confine them it is they who are the people of the scripture jews and christians
they are the transgressors
except those who repent thereafter and make amends surely god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and those who accuse their wives and do not have witnesses except themselves the testimony should be their mothers – and the testimony is for him the testimony of allah that he is truthful
and the fifth time that the curse of allah be upon him if he is a liar
and the punishment will revert the punishment from her if she testifieth by allah four times that verily he is of the liars
and the fifth that allahs wrath be upon her if he is of the truthtellers
and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you surely allah is relenting merciful
and if you seek guidance for them then seek refuge in allah from shaitan satan the outcast
verily those who brought forth the slander against aishah the wife of the prophet saw saw it was a group of you that was a great sin of disbelief and a group of you desired to be allah with him and a group of you desired to be a
belike it may be better for you if ye may be better than that
every soul is pledged to what it does
and of them who hath worked wrong so the guilt thereof unto them shall be mighty torment
and why did the believers men and women not think deeply in the oneness of allah and his noble messenger muhammad saw when they saw our males said this is a clear proof
why did they not bring four witnesses against it
since they did not bring the witnesses they are the liars before allah
if god will give you a greater fear in this world and in the world to come he will assign you a great reward
this is a serious doubt of which you have no knowledge of it
and you had assumed that allah ’s sight – you would not have indeed tested him with allah – and this is in the sight of allah
why did you not bring it back to us
nay
and this is a great calumny
that is better and purer yet nearer if you believe
god makes clear to you the signs for those who understand
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
verily those who love that indecency should be in the world and in the hereafter shall be a torment mighty
and allah knowcth and ye know not
and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you surely allah is full of kindness most merciful
“ in the name of allah is true and he is the most gracious the most merciful ”
o ye who believe follow not the footsteps of the satan verily he is unto you ever an enemy
and had allah not been for you o muhammad saw he would have been pleased with you and he would have hastened the wind and covered you therewith that which is in the heart of allah and that which is easy for you
but god purifies whom he wills
and allah is hearing knowing
and let not those of you who have affluence and amplitude among you swear off from giving wealth and possessions and their selves and their selves and the emigrants in the way of god let them pardon and overlook
let them pardon and forgive
do you not love that allah should forgive you
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
verily those who accuse chaste unknowing believing women shall be cursed in the world and in the hereafter
for them there is a great torment
on the day when their tongues their hands and their legs and feet will bear witness against them regarding what they used to do
on that day allah will pay them the recompense of their deeds in full and they will know that allah he is the manifest truth
vile women is for vile men and vile men for vile women these are for vile men and clean men are for clean women are for clean men and clean men are for clean women are for clean men and clean women are quit of what these people have
good statements are for good people or bad people are for good people and bad women for good men and good men for good women for good men and good women for good men are innocent of what people say these are innocent of what these people have been
they are the righteous
for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
o you who believe do not enter other houses except your own until you have asked permission and greeted their occupants
that is better for you haply you will reflect
and if you find not anyone therein enter not until leave has given you and if you are asked permission for it then go back
that is more virtuous and purer for you
and allah is allknower of what you do
there is no sin on you that you enter houses uninhabited wherein enjoyment is for you
and allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal
tell the believing men to lower their gaze from looking at forbidden things and protect their private parts from illegal sexual acts etc
that is purer for them and allah is allknower of what they do
tell the believing men to lower their gaze from looking at forbidden things and protect their private parts from illegal sexual acts etc and not to protect their private parts and reveal their adornment except that they may not display their charms except what is apparent like this is
o you who believe
so turn all your faces and obey god you may haply find success
marry off those of you who are single ie those of your male and female slaves and the poor who have not transgressed in the least
if they are poor god will enrich them of his grace god is bounteous and allknowing
and let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste until allah enriches them of his bounty
and those who seek the means of emancipation contract with them accordingly if you know some good in them and if you know any good in them they know them
and constrain not your slavegirls to prostitution if they desire to live in chastity
they will not believe unless they have wasted their guilt before will surely god is allforgiving allcompassionate
and whosoever will constrain them then verily allah isafter their constraintforgiving mercifu1
and assuredly we have sent down unto you signs clear signs and an admonition for the godfearing
god is the light of the heavens and the earth and the moon
the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a niche in which is a lamp is in a glass the glass is as if it were a star brilliant lit from a tree blest an olive tree neither in the east nor in the west wellnigh its oil
the light is only a niche in which is a lamp the lamp the lamp the oil wellnigh is in glass the glass the glass is as if it were a star shining like a pearl kindled by allah blessed olive tree nor of oil itself it light upon
light upon light the shadows full of fire
light upon light
god guides to his light whom he wills
thus allah propoundeth similitudes for mankind
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
in houses mosques which allah has ordered to be raised up in the mornings and the evenings
men whom neither trade nor sale diverts them from heart with allah and tongue nor from performing assalat iqamatassalat nor from giving the zakat
the day when the eyes will be blinded by night or the skins of the people
and allah will reward them for their deeds in full and will give them more out of his grace
as for those who disbelieve their deeds are like a mirage in a desert the thirsty one thinks it to be water till he comes to it he finds not the way of a man who settles his account for god is swift at the reckoning
god leads the good to him who follows his caprice
and allah is swift in reckoning
or like realms of darkness on a deep sea overwhelmed due covered by a wave covered by a wave covered it in layers of darkness upon darkness if a darkness of polytheism and security it is a great wave topped by one above another one above another if one
and if you stretch out your hand you can not penetrate him
and he who does not give him any light by god
hast thou not seen how that all those who are in the heavens and the earth and the birds with wings outspread their flight
each one knows its prayer and its extolling and god knows the things they do
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and unto allah is the return
hast thou not seen how god drives the clouds then composes them then converts them into a mass then thou seest the rain issuing out of them
with this qur’an is a clear sign from the sky and with it revived the earth after its death indeed allah sends down hail like mountains or wills he wills
the vivid flash of its clouds lightning nearly blinds the sight tafsir attabari
allah causes the night to succeed the day and the day the night is added in the hours of the day and he makes the day to enter into the night and he has subjected the sun and the moon each of them running to a stated term
verily in this is a lesson for men of insight
god created every moving creature of water of them is one that walketh upon its belly and of them is one that walketh upon its two feet and of them is one that walketh upon its belly and of them is one that walketh upon its bones
god creates what he wills
verily allah is able to do all things
we have indeed sent down clear signs
and allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
they say we believe in god and the messenger and the prophet and the unbelievers turn away after they have believed
they are not believers
and when they are called to allah and his noble messenger that he may judge between them and a party of them turn away and they turn away
but if the right is with them they will come to him willingly with submission
is there a disease in their hearts
or do they fear that allah will punish them in their punishment or punish them with his noble messenger
nay they are the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
the only saying of the believers when they are called to god and his messenger that he may judge between them is that they said we hear and we obey
they are the successful
and obey allah and his noble messenger and fear allah and his noble messenger and fear allah – it is they who are the successful
they swear by god their solemn oaths that if thou commandest them they will go forth
say thou swear ye not swear by allah that ye shall not swear we swear we swear you and their strongest oaths that ye shall not be negligent thereof
say obey god and obey the messenger
and obey allah and obey the noble messenger and the noble messenger is the only responsible for you
if you obey him you will be guided
the duty of the apostle is only to convey the message clearly
so those who accepted faith and did good deeds – allah will show them the way he has made them as he has made those among you who accepted faith and made their faith and made their faith and made their adopted sons their religion – equal in respect
then whosoever fabricateth a lie against allah after that hath gone astray verily these they are the wrongdoers
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey the messenger haply so you will find mercy
think not that the unbelievers can escape in the land
and their abode is hell an evil destination
o you who believe your fathers before you come to your mothers and your brothers when you have reached puberty ask your permission before you three occasions before fajr morning prayer and while you lay three occasions before fajr morning prayer and while you pray for three times gone
there is no sin on you if you fear that you may enter the houses salute them with a greeting in the name of god invoking blessings and good health that is better for you for you
and when you enter the houses salute each other
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you and allah is allknowing allwise
and when the children among you attain puberty then let them ask leave even as those before them asked leave
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may understand
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and there is no sin on them if they seek the means to keep themselves in secret except their keeping an outer garments
and to refrain ie not to discard their outer clothing is better for them
and allah is hearing knowing
there is no restriction on the blind nor any restraint upon the lame nor any constraint upon the sick nor upon yourselves if you eat from your houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your fathers ’ brothers or
there is no sin on you whether you eat together or apart
but when you enter the houses greet one another with a greeting from god blessed and good for god is aware of what you do
the believers are only those who believe in god and his apostle and they are not in the least but they are the prosperers
those are they who believe in god and his apostle and when they are with thee they are believers in god and his apostle
so when they ask your permission for some affairs of theirs give permission to whomever you will and ask your permission for them in this place of god and punish them for his forgiveness
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
do not consider your being summoned by god or do not address a thing in him or one among you as you have been given one another so that they may fear god and do not listen to the right path
lo verily allahs is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
he knows what state you are in and on the day when he knows what you are doing
then to him will you return and he will tell you what you were doing
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
blessed is he who sent down the criterion of right and wrong
his is the dominion of the heavens and the earth
he whose is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and who hath not taken a son
he has created all things and has measured it exactly according to each and every thing
yet they have taken besides him aliha gods that have no power to harm or profit them and have no power to harm or to do them
and those who disbelieve say this is a falsehood thathe hath fabricated and then there hath assisted him therein while they have not understood it this is a falsehood that is a people who believe
and they say tales of the ancients which he has written down and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon
say he has sent it down who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth he is allforgiving allcompassionate
and they say what ails this messenger that he eats food and goes in the markets
why was not an angel sent down along with him to give warning along with him ”
or the wrongdoeray ye follow only a man bewitched
the evildoers say you are only following a man bewitched
behold how they propound similitudes for thee
they have lost and can not find a way
blessed be he who if he wills will assign you better than all that gardens under which rivers flow paradise
nay but they deny the hour the resurrection day and we have prepared for those who disbelieve a blaze
when it see them from a far place they will hear its raging and roaring
and when they are cast within a narrow space of it chained together they would plead for death
“ this day you will not be compensated except for your deeds ”
say is this better or the garden of eternity promised to the godfearing
there will be for them high ranks with which they will be given as abiders therein
this is a promise incumbent on your lord which will certainly be fulfilled
on the day he will gather them together and say to them “ did you mislead my servants ” and they will say “ did you testify against these people ”
they will say glory be to thee
it is not for us to take any friends apart from him
nay but you gave these and their fathers enjoyment of days until the life of this world
then the followers of falsehood will say “ now lies those whom you have lost ”
what is the matter with you
we shall make the wicked among you taste of severe punishment
and we sent not before thee any envoys but that if we inspired from the markets like of that which we have sent before thee
and we have made some of you a trial for others will you not be godfearing
and we have made some of you a trial for others
and your lord is ever allseer of everything
those who do not hope to meet us say why are the angels not sent down on us or why are the angels not sent down on us
and indeed they have fallen into their mouths and their hearts had become hard and covered themselves with confusion in a strange thing
the day they see the angels no glad tidings will there be for the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc that day
and the angels will say “ all kinds of noble messengers ” – for us is an excellent sustenance for you and for the pious
we shall turn to whatever they did and scatter them like particles of dust
the dwellers of paradise will be the dwellers of paradise that day in the better place of afternoon rest that is a place of success
and on the day when the heaven is split asunder with clouds and the angels are in a high ground with allah
that is the day of judgement when the most gracious will ask for those who disbelieve or deny or disgrace will be a day of safety
the day the unjust will gnaw his hands saying “ alas if only i had chosen a way along with the noble messenger ”
she said woe to me
“ and i did not think that the punishment is only for a man and he is ever a betrayer of his trust ”
he led me astray from the warning after it had come to me
and the satan is ever a deserter to man in the hour of need
and the messenger muhammad saw will say o my lord verily my people deserted this quran neither listened to preach in haste
thus we have made a messenger muhammad saw as a messenger and those who have been cast forth into the mujrimun disbelievers polytheists sinners criminals etc
and thine lord suffices as a guide and helper
and those who disbelieve say why is the quran not revealed to him all at once thus it is sent down in parts that we may strengthen your heart thereby
and this is how we explain our verses in order that you may understand it and that you may make known its verses in order that it may increase in full and that it not be that they may lead men astray by their own knowledge and that it
and they have not come to thee in aught and we have given thee the truth and we have given thee and a true interpretation
those who will be pushed faces forward into hell will be in a worse position
and indeed we gave moosa the book and appointed with him his brother haroon as a deputy
then we said go you both to the people who have denied our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
then we annihilated them an utter annihilation
and nuhs noah people when they denied the messengers we drowned them and made them a sign for mankind and we made them as a sign for the people of the cave
and we have prepared for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc a painful torment
and ad and thamud and the dwellers of arrass and many generations in between them
and we illustrated examples to each one of them and ruining them annihilated them all
and indeed they have been ruined by the base of lout lot
so behold what wise he shall return
nay but they do not expect to resurrection
and when they see you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him they take you only as a mockery “ is this the one whom allah sent as a noble messenger ”
he would have surely turned us away from our gods if we had not adhered to them
they will know when they see the torment who it is further astray from the way
hast thou not regarded those who god his own desire wilt thou be a god other than him wilt thou be a guardian over them
or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand
they are but like unto the cattle nay they are further astray from the way
and had he willed he would have made it not been for the disbelievers all the blessings of your lord
then we made the sun its pilot to show the way
thereafter we seize it to ourselves drawing it gently
and it is he who made the night a covering for you and the sleep as repose and makes the day nushur ie getting up and going about here and going about here and there for daily work etc after ones sleep at night or like resurrection after ones
and it is he who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings going before his mercy rain we have sent down from the sky and therewith we have sent down pure water and therewith we have sent down from the heaven a wind in which is a lamp
and we have sent the winds bearing good tidings before his mercy and we have sent down from the heaven pure water and we have brought forth from the earth a proof to mankind
and assuredly we have propounded for mankind in this quran that they may ponder
that is the right religion but most men do not understand
and had we willed we would have raised a warner in every town
so do not listen to unbelievers and strive against them with greater effort
and it is he who has made two bodies of water flow side by side of the sea and one fresh sweet the other brine and bitter and has placed a barrier between them and a barrier between them
and it is he who created man from water then made them proper
and thy lord is ever potent
and they worship others besides allah that which can not harm them not neither profit them nor hurt
but those who disbelieve will be turned in repentance from their lord and then they will be in a way of pride
and we have sent you o muhammad saw only as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner
say i do not ask of you a wage for this except that whoever wills may take a way to his lord
and trust thou allah the living the sustainer
sufficiently is he aware of his servants sins
he created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he istawa rose over the throne in a manner that suits his majesty
none can touch except the most beneficent allah
and when it is said to them “ prostrate to the most gracious ” – they say “ and what is the most gracious
shall we prostrate ourselves unto that which thou commandest us
and it increases them in aversion
blessed be he who has created the heavens and the earth and has placed therein a firm and has placed therein a lamp spreading corruption in it and the moon giving light
and it is he who made the night and the day a succession for whom he desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude
the servants of the allmerciful are those who walk upon the earth modestly and who when the ignorant address them say peace
and those who spend their nights bowed and standing before their lord
and those who say our lord avert from us the torment of hell verily the torment thereof is perishment
it is indeed an evil halt and an evil abode
and those who when they expend are neither extravagant nor sparing and it is a medium inbetween
and those who do not worship any other deity along with allah and do not commit adultery and whoever does this will be punished for it and whoever does not do this will be punished for it
he will live in the torment on the day of resurrection and he will live in it in disgrace
except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds god will change their evil deeds into good deeds and will lead them astray by their evil deeds into gardens of paradise
and whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds then verily he repents towards allah with true repentance
and those who witness not falsehood and when they pass by with merchandise and when they pass by with dignity
and those who when they are reminded of the signs of their lord fall not down thereat deaf and blind
and those who say our lord bestow on us coolness of eyes from our wives and our offspring and make us unto the godfearing a pattern
those shall be rewarded with the highest apartment because they persevered and therein they shall be met with a greeting and salutation
abiders therein excellent it is as an abode and as a station
say o muhammad saw to them o my lord pays attention to you only because of your invocation to him
so they were not given to an atoms weight in this world and in the hereafter
ta sin mim
these are the verses of the clear book
belike thou shalt kill thyself with grief because they become not believers
if we will we can send down on them a sign from the sky so that their necks will remain bowed before it
never comes to them except they turn away from it
they are only ruining themselves for they lie
assuredly there shall come unto them the tidings of that whereat they were wo nt to mock
have they not seen the earth that how many honourable pairs we have created in it
verily in this is a sign for people who think deeply
and most of them believe not
and verily your lord he is indeed the allmighty the most merciful
and remember when your lord said to the people of firaun pharaoh
the people of firaun pharaoh will they not fear allah
he said my lord verily i fear they will belie me
and my breast straitens and my tongue expresses not well so send for harun aaron to come along with me
and my lord is guardian over them
allah said nay
go with my signs both of you and your lord is with you
so go you both to pharaoh and say we are the messengers of the lord of the worlds
‘ that you let the descendants of israel go with us ’ ”
said firaun “ did we not raise you amongst us as a child and you did not live in your years and your life with us ”
and you commited what you did and you are ungrateful
and you commited what you did and you are ungrateful
musa moses said i did it then when i was an ignorant as regards my lord and his message
so i fled from you when i feared you and my lord has pardoned me and the messenger
and that is the blessing thou reproachest me with having enslaved the children of israel
firaun pharaoh said and what is the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
musa moses said lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you seek to be convinced with certainty
said he to those about him do you not hear
musa moses said your lord and the lord of your ancient fathers
said firaun “ this noble messenger of yours who has been sent towards you is a madman ”
musa moses said lord of the east and the west and all that is between them if you understand
firaun pharaoh said if you choose an ilah god other than me i will certainly place you in the one musa moses
musa moses said even though i bring you something manifest
firaun pharaoh said bring it forth then if you are of the truthful
so he cast his staff and behold it was a serpent manifest
and he drew forth his hand and lo it was white unto the beholders
said firaun to the court members around him “ he is indeed an expert magician ”
he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic
what do you advise
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send summoners to the cities to gather
to bring you every cunning sorcerer
so the magicians were assembled at a set time on a day made known
and it was said to the people “ did you assemble ”
they said belike we may follow the magicians if they are victorious
so when the magicians arrived they said “ will we get some reward if we are victorious ”
he said yes and moreover you will in that case be of the nearest to me
musa moses said to them throw what you are going to throw
so they threw their ropes and rods and said by the glory of pharaoh we shall be victorious
then musa moses threw his stick and behold it swallowed up all the falsehoods which they showed
then the magicians flung themselves prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of the worlds
musa moses said o harun aaron
firaun pharaoh said you have believed in him before i gave you leave
he is your chief who taught you magic so you will come to know
i will have your hands and feet on alternate sides cut off and have you all crucified
they said no harm surely unto our lord we are turning
verily we long that our lord will forgive us our faults because we have been the first of the believers
and we revealed unto musa saying go with my bondmen by night verily ye shall be pursued
then firaun pharaoh sent callers to all the cities
proclaiming surely they are a small band of fugitives
and verily they have enraged us
but we are a fully accounted army
so we made them die and we were the inheritors
and treasures and agreeable mansions
thus it was and we made the children of israel possess them
so we drowned the firaun and all his people in the sea
and when the two forces drew within seeing each other they saw their own eyes and when the distance appeared face forthwith overtaken them with the people of the evildoers
musa moses said nay verily my lord will guide me
then we revealed unto musa saying smite thou the sea with thy staff
and it parted and each separate part of that sea water became like a huge firm mass of a mountain
and we brought near thither the others
and we delivered moses and those with him all together
then we drowned the others
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is indeed the allmighty the most merciful
and recite to them the news of ibrahim
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
they said we worship idols and we are unto them ever devoted
he said do they hear you when you call on their tongues no one
or do they benefit you or do they harm you
they said nay but we found our fathers doing so
he said have you considered what you have been worshipping
you and your fathers
they are an enemy to me except the lord of all the worlds
who created me and showed me the way
“ and eat and drink and feed me ”
and when i sicken then he healeth me
who makes me to die then gives me life again
and who i hope will forgive me my faults on the day of recompense the day of judgement
he said “ my lord has forgiven me and me is a noble messenger ”
and appoint for me a tongue of truthfulness among the later times
and make me one of the inheritors of the garden of delight
and forgive my father and my father
and forgive my father
degrade me not upon the day when they are raised up
the day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail
except him who comes to god with a pure heart attached to allah alone and none else worshipping none but him alone the true believers in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism pure from all that he has given up rivals in him
and paradise will be brought near to the muttaqun pious see v 22
and hell will be the promised place for the taghun transgressors and disobedient etc
and it will be said to them “ where are those whom you used to worship ”
apart from god
apart from god
and they have appointed a similitude for themselves who can be created by themselves and who can not see us and who is the state of sanctity ”
and the roasting in hell
and the hosts of iblis together
they will say while contending therein
by god we were plainly in error
when we held you false gods as equals in worship with the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
and none led us astray except the culprits
now we have no intercessors
nor any sincere friend
if only we had another chance to return to the world and the hereafter surely we would be among the believers
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is indeed the allmighty the most merciful
the people of nuh noah belied the messengers
when their brother noah said to them will you not be godfearing
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
i ask of you no wage for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
they said shall we seek refuge in thee from among the people who are judaised and we shall be stiffnecked against you
he said what knowledge have i of that they have been doing
their reckoning is upon my lord if you but knew
and i am not going to drive away the believers
i am only a plain warner
they said if thou givest not over noah thou shalt assuredly be one of the stoned
he said my lord verily my people have belied me
so adjudge between me and them conclusively and save me and the believers who are with me
so we saved him and those with him in the laden ship
then we drowned the rest disbelievers thereafter
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is indeed the allmighty the most merciful
ad cried lies to the envoys
when their brother hud said to them will you not be godfearing
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
i ask of you no wage for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
and you construct monuments on every hill in vain
and take ye for yourselves castles that haply ye may abide
and when you seize you as tyrants
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
and we have created you of the cattle for you in which you know not
and he aided you with cattle and sons
and gardens and springs
i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
they said it is the same to us whether you preach or do not warn
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
and we are not going to be punished
in response they denied him so we destroyed them indeed in fact most of them do not believe
and verily your lord he is indeed the allmighty the most merciful
the thamud belied the messengers
when their brother salih said to them will you not be godfearing
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
i ask of you no wage for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
will you be left secure in that which you have here
and gardens and springs
sown fields and palms with slender spathes
and you carve houses in the mountains with great skill
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
and follow not the command of almusrifun ie their chiefs leaders who were polytheists criminals and sinners
and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed
they said surely you are deluded
you are only a human being like us
they said bring us a sign if you speak the truth
saleh said here is a shecamel and you have a right to drink water
and do not abandon your gods on that day you will be unaware of your deeds
and touch her not with harm lest the torment of a great day seize you
then they were seized by the mighty ones
and the torment overtook them
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is indeed the allmighty the most merciful
the people of lot cried lies to the envoys
when their brother lot said to them will you not take heed
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
i ask of you no wage for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
what do you go in lustfully to men instead of women
leaving your wives that your lord created for you
nay but you are a people who exceed the limits
they said if you cease not o lout lot we shall surely be driven forth from the city
he said verily i am an apostle of my crimes
my lord deliver me and my household from that which they work
so we saved him and his family all
except one old woman who stayed behind
then we destroyed the others
and we rained down on them a rain of stones
god is aware of the things they do
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is indeed the allmighty the most merciful
the dwellers of alaiyka near madyan midian belied the messengers
when shuaib shuaib said to them will you not fear allah and obey him
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
i ask of you no wage for this
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
give full measure and do not cheat
and weigh with justice and skimp not in the balance
and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed
fear him who created you and the earlier generations
they said surely you are deluded
you are but a human being like us
and they said “ we think you are a liar ”
then drop down on us lumps from heaven if thou art one of the truthful
he said my lord knows very well what you are doing
in response they denied him so the punishment of the day of the tent seized them that was indeed a punishment of a great day
verily the torment of a great day ie a great day ie the day of resurrection
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is indeed the allmighty the most merciful
and verily this quran is an absolute truth from the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
which the trustworthy ruh jibrael gabriel has brought down
upon your heart that you may be one of the warners
in plain arabic speech
and verily it is in the scriptures of the ancients
was it not a sign for them that the scholars of the descendants of israel knew it
and had we sent it down on a barbarian
and had we sent it down on a barbarian
thus do we cause it the quran to enter into the hearts of the mujrimun criminals polytheists sinners etc
they will not believe in it until they see the painful torment
it will come upon them unawares and they will not comprehend it
then they will say are we to be respited
do they seek to hasten our punishment
beholdest thou if we let them enjoy for years
and then what they had been promised comes upon them
of what avail shall their enjoyment be to them
never did we destroy a township but it had its warners
by way of admonition and we have never been oppressors
and it is not the shayatin devils who have brought it this quran down
this is because they are an enemy to allah
they are unworthy of it nor can they do it
verily they have been removed far from hearing it
so call not thou upon another god with god lest thou shouldst be one of the evildoers
and warn your near relations
and lower your wing humbly for the believers who follow you
and if they disobey thee say i am innocent of what you do
and rely thou upon the mighty the merciful
who watches you when you get up
and when you see the stars they prostrate themselves
he is allhearing and allknowing
shall i tell you on whom the devils descend
they descend upon every calumniator sinner
who gives ear to the devils and they pour what they may have heard of the unseen from the angels and most of them are liars
and the poets the perverse follow them
observest thou not that they say whatsoever they do
and they say what they do not do
except those who believe and do the right and remember god will never forgive them and be patient and remember and be patient in gods disobedience and remember and remember him much and more unjust
ta sin
these are verses of the quran and a clear book
a guidance and glad tidings for the muhsinun gooddoers
those who perform assalat iqamatas salat and give zakat and they have faith in the hereafter with certainty
those who do not believe in the hereafter their deeds are decked out fair to them their deeds and they are decked out fair to them
those are they for whom is the worst chastisement in this world and in the hereafter they will be the greatest losers
verily this is the receiving of the wise the allknowing
remember when moses said to his family i see a fire i will bring you news from it or bring you a brand that you may warm yourselves
when he came to it he was called blessed is he who is in the fire and he who is about it
glory be to god the lord of all being
o musa moses i am allah the allmighty the allwise
throw down your staff
so he cast it down and lo it was a serpent running along with them and turned into a barren shore
o musa fear not verily
verily the messengers fear not verily in front of me
except the wrongdoers
except him who does evil and has done evil – so he who does evil is a disobedient to allah and i am forgiving and merciful
put your hand in the bosom of my shirt it will come out white without any blemish
they are certainly a rebellious people
then when our enlightening signs came to them they said “ this is clear magic ”
and they gainsaid them out of spite and arrogance although their souls were convinced thereof
so behold what like hath been the end of the corruptors
and indeed we gave dawud david and sulaiman solomon
and they will say all praise be to allah who has preferred us above many of his believing slaves
and sulaiman solomon said to dawud david and sulaiman solomon “ o people we have been taught the language of birds and we have been given from all things this is indeed clear for us ”
that is the evident success
and assembled together for sulaiman solomon his armies of jinns and men and birds and they had set in bands
till when they came to the valley of the ants one of the ants said o ants enter your dwellings lest sulaiman solomon and his hosts crush you while they perceive not
so he smiled amused at her speech and said my lord arouse me that i should be thankful for thy favour wherewith thou hast favoured me and my parents and that i may work righteously pleasing thee and that i may be of the righteous
and by your mercy ie do not try me through my grace
and he reviewed the birds then he said how is it with me that i do not see the hoopoe
or is he among the absent
i will punish him with a severe torment or i will punish him with a severe torment
but he tarried not till he was myself and said what you do not know
i found a woman ruling over them and she said i have seen a man of the sun and the moon yet i have seen what they associate with him and i have seen what they do not even in the earth and i have seen him
i found a woman ruling over them and she has been given of everything and she possesses a mighty throne and a woman who believes in god and his offspring and only he is their own good yet you do not know them
i found her and her people prostrating before god
the satan has made their deeds look attractive to them and has made them strays from the right path
whether you discuss a thing or conceal it god knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and what you conceal
allah there is no god but he the lord of the glorious throne
sulaiman said we shall see whether thou hast spoken the truth or whether thou art amongst the liars
go with this letter of mine and cast it unto them then behold what answer they shall return
she said o chiefs verily it is from me and it is a palace in order that i have surrendered
it is from solomon and it is begins with beginning with the name of allah the most beneficent the most merciful
rise not up against me but come to me in surrender
she said o chiefs counsel me in my affair
i decide no case till you are present with me
they said we are owners of great violence but the affair rests with thee so consider what thou wilt command
she said verily kings when they enter a city disorder it and make the end of its inhabitants thereof behold they do
that is so
and i will send them a present and see what the envoys bring back
so when the envoy came to sulaiman he said “ are you helping me with wealth
he said what is with you is better than what he has given you rather you rejoice in your gift
return them we shall soon overcome them with a severe torment and with them wherever they come can not resist and we shall expel them from there abased and utterly humbled
he said o chiefs which of you is obedient to me
an ifrit strong from the jinns said i will bring it to you before you rise from your place council
he said verily i am in a man of glory
and the one who had been vouchsafed knowledge said i will bring it to you in your twinkling of an eye
then when he saw it placed before him he said this is a cunning sorcerer or if i am thankless then a sure to return of its fruits he said i am grateful to you
whoever is grateful is grateful for himself but if one is thankless then surely my lord is unconcerned and magnanimous
and whosoever disbelieveth then verily my lord is rich free of all wants and verily my lord is rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
he said disguise her throne for her that we may behold whether she is guided or if she is of those having been guided
so when she arrived it was said is your throne like this
she said it seems the same
she said it seems the same that we may test you whether you are true believers in fact it is a muslim before this
and she was prevented her from allah ’s mosque until she came to it – she was of a disbelieving people ”
it was said to her enter the pavilion
when she saw it she thought it was a pool and bared her shanks
he said it seems the shecamel to live at ease
“ alas – i have indeed done wrong to my own harm and i have indeed done a muslim ”
and to thamud people we sent their brother salih saleh and said o my people
he said o my people why do you seek to hasten evil before the good
why do you not seek forgiveness from allah perhaps there may be mercy upon you ”
they said we augur ill of thee and of those who are with thee
he said your augury is with allah
in fact you are a people who do not believe
and there were in the city nine men from the sons of their chiefs who made mischief in the land and did not reform
they said “ swear by allah that we will attack saleh and his family at night and the leaders of his people ”
and they plotted a plot and we planned a plan while they perceived not
so behold what wise was the end of their plotting of corruption
so yonder are their houses overturned for they did wrong
surely in that is a sign for a people who understand
and we rescued those who accepted faith and were pious
he said “ do you commit lewdness with this just one lustfully go towards you ”
what do you approach men lustfully instead of women
nay but you are a people who behave senselessly
but the only answer of his people was that they said expel the folk of lot from your city they are a people who wish to be pure
so we saved him and his family except his wife we destined her to be of those who remained behind
and we rained down on them a rain of stones
how ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned but warned in vain
say all the praises and thanks be to allah
peace be on his chosen servants
is god better or what they associate with him
who created the heavens and the earth and rains down water from the sky for you from the sky and the earth
is there any god along with allah
nay but they are a people who behave senselessly
who then made the earth a habitable place and made the rivers flow in its valleys and dales and placed upon it firm stabilisers and kept a barrier between two bodies of water
is there any ilah god with allah
nay but most of them know not
who hears the cry of the anguished soul when it calls to him and relieves its suffering and who made you trustees on the earth
is there any ilah god with allah
little do you remember
is not he best who guideth you in the darknesses of the land and the sea and who sendeth the winds as heralds before his mercy
is there any ilah god with allah
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
who creates first then reverts it and who gives you food and the earth
is there any ilah god with allah
say bring your proof if you are truthful
say god knows what is in the heavens and the earth except the truth and they know not
nay but their knowledge fails not the hereafter
and those who disbelieve say when we have become dust we and our fathers shall we indeed be brought forth again
we and our fathers were promised this before it
naught is this but fables of the ancients
say travel on the earth and see what like has been the end of the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc
and grieve you not for them nor be straitened in distress because of what they plot
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say thou belike riding behind you seek some part of that which ye are impatient for it
verily your lord is full of grace for mankind yet most of them do not give thanks
and verily thine lord knoweth that which they keep secret and whatsoever they make known
and there is nothing hidden in the heaven and the earth but is in a clear book ie allauh almahfuz
verily this quran narrates to the children of israel most of that about which they differ
and verily it is a guidance and a mercy unto the believers
verily your lord will decide between them various sects by his judgement
he is the omnipotent
so put your trust in allah surely you o muhammad saw are on manifest truth
verily thou canst not make the dead hear nor canst thou make the deaf hear the call when they flee turning their backs
nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray you can make none hear except those who believe in our signs and have come to submission
you can make none hear except those who believe in our signs and have come to submission
and when the promise of punishment came to them from a place they did not know
and remember the day we shall gather from every community a troop of those who denied our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and then they will be held in order to separate them on the straight path
he will say are you who argued with me about
or what is it that you were doing
so the word of torment will be realized against them
and they will not be able to speak
do they not see that we have made the night for them to rest in it and the day to see how they are subjected the sun and the moon each swimming atop each other
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
and remember the day when the trumpet will be blown and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will be terrified except him whom allah wills and all everyone in the heavens and the earth will exempt them and all those who are
and you will see the mountains and think them solid but they shall pass away as the passing away of the clouds
god is the creator of all things
he is wellacquainted with what you do
whoever brings a good deed islamic monotheism and brings it back to allah ie islamic monotheism his reward in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in his messenger muhammad saw is better than allah
on that day they will be fully exposed
and whosoever brings an evil deed their faces shall be thrust into the fire
are you recompensed aught save what you used to do
say i am commanded to worship the lord of this city who has sanctified it and his is everything
and remember thou the one who is in the inspired in his presence
and whosoever receiveth guidance receiveth guidance for his own soul and as for him who strayeth say thou i am only in the wrong and i am naught but a warner
and i am not a guardian over you
and say praise belongs to god
anon he shall shew you his signs so that ye will recognize them
and your lord is not unaware of what you do
ta sin mim
these are the verses of the clear book
we recite to you some of the news of musa moses and firaun pharaoh in truth for a people who believe not
verily firaun pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people sects weakening oppressing a group ie children of israel among them killing their sons and letting their females live
verily he was of the mufsidun ie those who commit great sins and crimes oppressors tyrants etc
and we wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leaders and heirs
and to make them leaders in the land and to make them taste the intense and the children of israel and to drive them away from firaun pharaoh and haman and their hosts
we inspired moses and his brother when you fear for him then we inspired him with your tongue and mother will return him to you and take care of him
do not fear and do not grieve
we have sent him to you and to bring him back to the envoys
then the household of firaun pharaoh picked him up that he become their enemy and a cause of grief
and firaun pharaoh said his chiefs are taking comfort for me and for you
so take him alone as wakil disposer of your affairs
and slay not him perchance he will take him for a son or we may take care of him
and they did not know –
the heart of moses ’s mother became empty from every thought except the thought of moses became empty and she thought
and we had not strengthened her heart to remain a believer she had almost given him away
and she said to his musas moses sister follow him
so she watched him from afar and he therefore turned on a part of the path of the fire
and we made them virgins too for that which we had forbidden aforetime
he said “ i will not be a son or any one to whom the son has a right to be done with him ”
so we restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve and that she might know that the promise belongs to him but most men do not know
and when he attained his full strength and was perfect in manhood we bestowed on him hukman prophethood right judgement of the affairs and religious knowledge of the religion of his forefathers ie islamic monotheism
thus do we reward the doers of good
and he entered the city at a time when its people were unheeding and found there two men fighting the one was of his own party and the other was of his enemies
then he was of his party called out to help the one who was of his enemies
and he sought to help his army against him and behold the people who had been oppressed
so moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off
he said my lord verily i have wronged myself so forgive me
then he forgave him
he is the forgiving the merciful
he said my lord as you have favoured me i will never be a helper for the mujrimun criminals disobedient to allah polytheists sinners etc
in the morning he came to the city fearful and hesitant and prayed him to help him who had asked him for help again
and he who had asked him for help the day before called him for help again
musa moses said to him verily you are a plain warner
then when he sought to seize him who was an enemy to both he said o musa moses is that thou wouldst slay me as thou didst slay me a man yesterday
you only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker
and there came a man running from the farthest part of the town a man running he said o musa moses verily the chiefs are taking counsel you to kill you o musa moses
so he went forth from thence fearing looking abcut he said my lord deliver me from the wrongdoing people
and when he turned his face towards midian he said it may be that my lord will guide me
and when he arrived at the water of madyan he found there a group of the people watering their flocks and besides them he found two women restraining their animals he said “ what is the matter with you ”
they said we can not water our animals till they have been able to stop us from it
they said we can not water our animals till we cross the poor and the fat cows are flying against the water
so he watered their flocks for the shade and then he turned back to the shade and said my lord i have given you good tidings of my own and do not let my affair work
then there came to him one of the two women walking shyly
they said “ o my father
he said o nuh noah
said yusuf “ o my father employ him for you are indeed the best of those who do good ”
he said i would marry thee to one of these two daughters of mine provided you but if thou completest ten that shall be of thy hurt laden ship
i wish not in contradiction to you to do that which i forbid you
you will find me patient if god wills
musa moses said what is with me is true so help you and i fulfill your covenant with you
so when moses had accomplished the term and departed with his family he observed on the right course
when he saw a fire he said to his family tarry you here i observe a fire
when he saw a fire he said to his family i see a fire
perhaps i may bring you news from it or a faggot from the fire that haply you shall warm yourselves
so when he came to it the fire he was called from the right side of the valley in the blessed field in the tree “ o moosa i am allah the lord of the creation ”
throw down your staff
so he cast it down and lo it was a serpent running along with them and turned into a barren shore
they said o musa moses
come forward and fear not verily you are in peace
and put your hand into your bosom it will come forth white without hurt
he said my lord i have killed a man among them and i fear they will kill me
aaron my brother
he is more eloquent than i in speech than i in speech so send him with me as a thousand years of that they will deny me
he said we shall strengthen your arm with your brother and give you authority so that they will not be able to harm you
you are indeed the victors
then when musa came unto them with our signs they said this is naught but a manifest magic
he is naught but an invention
and musa said my lord knows best who bringeth guidance from him and whose will be the happy end in the abode
verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc shall not be successful
and firaun pharaoh said o chiefs know not that you have any god other than me i know not that i think that you have a god apart from me and i think that i am a liar
and he and his soldiers wrongfully sought greatness in the land and assumed they would never be brought back to us
so we seized him and his hosts and threw them into the sea
so behold what like hath been the end of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and we made them leaders inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
and we caused a curse to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection they shall be among almaqbuhun those who are prevented to receive allahs mercy or any good despised or destroyed etc
and assuredly we gave moses the scripture that they may remember or be warned as a book to be raised
you were not present on the western side of mount sinai when we decreed the commandments to moses nor were you witness to the event
how many a city we have sent thee a sending many a nation before them and we sent thee as a book to nations before them
and you o muhammad saw were not you that you should bring it as a warning from your lord to warn
and if an affliction befalls them because of what their hands have sent forward to them they would say our lord why did you not send a messenger to us a messenger to that which their hands have sent down and they should have followed your ayat proofs evidences
but when the truth came to them from us they said why has he not been given the like of what was in the same language
or did they not disbelieve in what moses they said with moosa
say thou then bring a book from allah which is better than these two unto them if ye say sooth
but if they do not answer you then know that they only follow their own desires and that they only follow their own desires
and who is more astray than one who follows his guidance than he who follows his guidance
verily allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and assuredly we have caused the word to reach them in succession that haply they may be admonished
those to whom we gave the book before this believe in it
and when it is read to them they say we believe in it
verily it is the truth from our lord
and before this we have been muslims those who submit themselves to allah in islam before it
these shall be given their recompense twice over because they patiently persevered and they expend of that wherewith we have provided them secretly and combat evil with good and they are the good and expend of that we have provided them
and when they hear indecent speech they ignore it and say “ our deeds and for you are your deeds and for you are your deeds and for you are your deeds ”
peace be upon you
we are not afraid
you can not guide any one you like god guides whosoever he please and he knows best the guided one
they say if we follow the guidance with you we would be snatched from our land
have we not established for them a provision from us
nay but most of them know not
and qarun and firawn and haman
and yonder are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them unless for a little while and verily we
we have been the inheritors
and never did your lord destroy habitations without having sent an apostle to their metropolis to read out our commandments to them
and none feeleth secure against the contrivance of allah except the people who are zalimun polytheists wrongdoers disbelievers in the oneness of allah
whatever thing you have been given is the enjoyment of the present life but what is with god is better and more enduring
will you not then understand
is he then whom we have promised an excellent promise which he is made to him whom we have given a good promise – like him whom we have made a fair promise – he is therefore gone by on the day of resurrection
and on the day when he will call to them and say where are my associates whom you used to assert as partners in worship with allah
those against whom the sentence is justified will say on those who were subdued “ our lord these are those whom we led astray from them ” and they will proffer them their backs and they will be witnesses
and it will be said call your ascribed partners to allah and let them call upon your socalled partners of allah
and they will call upon them but they will not answer them
would that they had received the guidance
and on the day when he will call to them and say what answer gave you to the messengers
how is it that day which is the news when they will not be able to ask one another
but those who repent and believe and do the right are the successful
your lord creates what he wills and chooses
and the good deeds not choose is the glory of allah
high be he exalted above that they associate with him
and thy lord knoweth that which their breasts conceal and that which they make known
he is god there is no god but he to him you shall be returned
say what think you if god makes the night unceasing over you until the day of resurrection what god other than god shall bring you illumination
will you not then hear
say what think you if god makes the day of resurrection then other than god who will bring you night day
and allah measureth the night and the day that ye may seek his grace and that ye may seek his grace by night and that haply ye may return thanks
and on the day when he will call to them and say where are my associates whom you used to assert as partners in worship with allah
and we shall draw out from every community a witness and say bring your proof
then you will know that gods is true and there will go astray from them that they were forging
verily qarun korah was of musas moses people but he behaved arrogantly towards them
and we gave him treasures that the keys of the people of the weakness and he had too strength for them
when his people said to him do not exult god loves not those that exult
god has given you the home of the hereafter and forget not your part in this world and do not forget your part and do not like that god does not like the mischievous people
he said verily he hath been vouchsafed this only because of that which is in the knowledge
did he not know that allah has destroyed many generations before him who is stronger than he in might and larger in respect of following
and the guilty will not be questioned concerning their sins
then he went forth unto his people in his pomp said verily the adornment of the life of this world that deceived
verily he is a man of great fortune
but those who had been given the knowledge said woe to you
but those who believe and do the right will have better than god in the least and god is better than everything
but none shall be patient except those who bear patient
so we caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling and there was no host to save himself and he was helpless
and those who had desired for his position the day before desired his status said “ indeed allah gives whomever he wills and he wills and in the morning is the result of what he wills
had god not been gracious to us he would have opened up the earth to live with it
had god not been gracious to us he would have opened up the earth to live with it
know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful
that is the last abode and we appoint it a sign for the people of the world to come
the future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
whoever brings a good deed islamic monotheism and whoever brings an evil deed will have better than it and whoever brings an evil deed polytheism disbelief in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and whoever brings an evil deed we shall only make it only as a recompense for
and remember thou o muhammad saw allah is ever sending down unto thee from heaven and allah is hearing knowing
say my lord knows best who has come to guidance and who is in manifest error
you did not expect that the book would be given to you except by the favour of your lord
and never may they prevent you from the verses of allah after they have been sent down upon you and call them to your lord and never come to you o muhammad saw
and call thou unto thy lord and be thou not of the idolaters
and invoke not any other ilah god along with allah la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he
there is no god but he
he is your lord and to him you will return
he is your lord and to him you will return
alif lam mim
do people think that they will be left alone because they will not be tested
and assuredly we had tried those who were before them assuredly god will assuredly know who were ever aware of the liars
or do those who do evil deeds think that we shall make them known to us
how bad is the judgement that they make
whoever hopes for the meeting with allah then allahs term is surely coming and verily the hour shall come to pass
and allah is hearing knowing
and whosoever strive striveth only for himself
verily allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs the allknower
and those who believe and do righteous good deeds we shall surely acquit them of their evil deeds and shall recompense them with the best of what they used to do
and we have enjoined on man kindness unto parents
and if they strive with thee to make thee associate with me that whereof thou hast no knowledge then do not obey them
to me is your return and i will tell you what you used to do
and those who believe and do righteous deeds assuredly we shall admit them among the righteous
and among mankind is he who says “ we believe in allah whereas the promise of allah is very severe ” whereas they are not in the cause of allah
and if help comes to them from your lord they say we were with you
does not god know what is in their hearts
verily allah knows the believers and he knows the hypocrites
those who disbelieve say follow our way and follow our way we shall surely carry your sins on our paths lest you reach the right way
we shall forgive you your sins and we shall increase you your sins
but they can not carry the burden of their sins
they are indeed liars
and they will carry their own loads and other loads along with their own loads and they will not be questioned on the day of resurrection
and on the day of resurrection he will be questioned about their deeds
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people – he therefore stayed with them a thousand years less fifty years inviting them to fear allah and whatever is a thousand years
and we rescued him and those with him in the ship and made it a sign for the entire world
and we sent lut said to his people “ worship allah and fear him ”
that is better for you if you only knew
you worship idols and only forge against god falsehood rather than you are nothing but fabricators
verily those whom you worship instead of allah can not grant you a provision from allah
and seek with allah provision wherever he wills and seek your provision from allah
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
and to him you shall be returned
and if you deny then many a people have denied before you
the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
do they not see how god originates creation then reverts it this is easy for god
say travel in the land and see how he originated creation then allah will show the end of those who are partners in the hereafter and look back
he punishes whom he wills and has mercy on whom he wills and to him you shall return
and you can not escape in the earth or in the heaven
and besides allah you have neither any wali protector or guardian nor any helper
and those who disbelieve in the signs of allah and in the meeting with him they are in despair of my mercy and it is they who are the losers
for them there is a painful torment
but the only answer of his people was that they said slay him or burn him
but god saved him from the fire
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
and he said you have taken others for worship idols in the life of this world and then some of you have taken others as auliya protectors and helpers one of you will be among you enemies one of you and another as friends one of you has another
your abode is the fire and you have none to help you
so he believed in him and he is the allmighty the allwise
and we bestowed on him ishaq and yaqub and we placed among his posterity prophethood and the book and we vouchsafed unto him his hire in the world and in the hereafter he shall be of the righteous
and he is among the righteous
and we sent lut – you commit the indecency as many times such as do not commit the shameful acts in the creation has been committed before you
what do you approach men and cut the way and commit in your assembly dishonour
but the only answer of his people was that they said then bring the torment of our own if what you say is true
he said my lord help me against the people who are mufsidun evildoers liars etc
and when our messengers came to lout lot they said verily we shall destroy the town its inhabitants thereof have gone in the city as its inhabitants thereof know it not
he said therein is also there
we know best who is therein
except his wife who was muslim
and when our messengers came to lout lot he was grieved because of them
they said fear not we shall surely deliver thee and his family except thy wife she has been of those that tarry
except his wife who was muslim
they said we are in this town a great torment from the sky because they have been sent down on the morrow
and indeed we have left thereof a sign a clear sign for people who understand
and we sent the people of madyan midian their brother shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
take him and fetter him
and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed
so they denied him so the earthquake seized them – so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes
and ad and thamud and their people
and satan made their deeds appear good to them and they thought that they were doing them and i am their hands so that they may realise that they were guided
verily qarun pharaoh haman and qarun korah was of the people of pharaoh
and assuredly musa came unto them with evidence but they imagined that there would not be in the land nor would they be stiffnecked in the land
so we seized them with punishment because of their sins
of them were some on whom we sent a violent wind and of them were some whom we sent down shower of stones so we seized them with a grip of one another
god was not one to wrong them but they wronged themselves
god is the likeness of those who take auliya protectors and helpers other than him is as the likeness of a spider who builds for itself a house but surely the frailest weakest of houses is the spiders house if they but knew
verily allah is ever allpowerful allwise
and these similtudes we propound them for mankind and none understand them save men of knowledge
allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth
verily in this is a sign for those who believe
recite what has been revealed to you of the book and perform the prayer surely the prayer is sickness
verily allah is the most great
and allah is the allknower of what you do
o people of the scripture jews and christians
and we shall make them die as a temptation so long as they would
and what has been sent down to you o muhammad saw from those who were sent down to you muhammad saw and what was sent down to us and what was sent down before and what was sent down to you and they recite to themselves and they do
we make no distinction between one another among them and to him we have submitted ourselves
even so we have sent down to thee the book
those to whom we gave the scripture ie the taurat torah and the injeel gospel etc believe in it the quran
and of them are some who believe in it
you did not read any book before this nor wrote one with your right hand or else these dissemblers would have found a cause to doubt it
in fact in the minds of those who have intelligence these are clear signs
and none denies our signs except every perfidious ungrateful
they say why have signs not been gent down upon him from his lord
say signs are only with god
i am only a plain warner
is it not sufficient for them that we have sent down to you the book that is recited to them
verily herein is a mercy and a reminder for a people who believe
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
those who believe in vanity and disbelieve in god those they are the losers
they ask you to hasten on the torment
and had not a time appointed the torment would have come to them
and surely it shall come upon them of a sudden while they perceive not
they ask you to hasten on the torment
surely hell is ever an encompasser of the infidels
on the day when the punishment will envelop them from above them and from below their feet and he will say taste what you used to do
o my slaves who believe
every soul will taste death then it is to us that you will return
but those who believe and do the right will be admitted to gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
excellent is the hire of the workers
those who patiently endured and who rely only upon their lord
and many a beast that bears not its water base so that is how allah gives you sustenance from the skies and he gives you sustenance to whomever he wills and he is the all hearing the all knowing
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth and the sun and the moon they will surely reply allah
how then are they deviating
god increases the means of those of his creatures as he please or limits them for whomsoever he will
verily allah is of everything knower
if you ask them who sends down water rain from the sky and quickens the earth after its death they will surely reply allah
say all the praises and thanks be to allah but most of them know not
nay but most of them have no knowledge
and this life of the world is nothing but play and pastime and undoubtedly the abode of the hereafter is indeed the abode of the hereafter is indeed the most honourable this life did they but know
if only they had sense
and when they board a ship they call on allah making their faith pure for him only but when he brings them safely to land behold they make a partner in their worship
but when he brings them safely back to shore they begin to associate others with him
so that they become ingrate for that which we have given them and that they take their enjoyment as a warning and a threat but they will come to know
have they not seen that we have appointed a sanctuary secure and that men are being snatched away from all around them
do they then believe in vanity and do they disbelieve in gods blessing
who does greater wrong than he who fabricates lies about god or denies the truth when it comes to him
is there not in gehenna a lodging for the unbelievers
as for those who strive hard in us we will surely guide them to our paths
and allah is with the muhsinun doers of good
alif lam mim
the romans have been defeated
in the nearer land syria iraq jordan and palestine and they after their defeat will be victorious
in a few years
the believers will rejoice on that day
and allah is ever allpowerful allmighty
he is the almighty the merciful
this is the supreme law
and allah fails not his promise but most men do not know
they know only the palpable life of this world and are oblivious of the hereafter
have they not seen that god did not create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them except with a purpose and for an appointed time
yet many men reject the meeting with their lord
have they not travelled on the earth and seen what befell the people before them
and we have created the earth in order that we may test them in some of them to understand
their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they were not such as to believe in them
god was not one to wrong them but they wronged themselves
then the end of those who committed evil was evil for that they cried lies to the signs of god and mocked at them
god originates creation then brings it back again then to him you shall be returned
and on the day when the hour will be established the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets sorrows and despair
and those whom allah has cursed and have supporters besides him that they associate with him as partners in worship with allah
and on the day when the hour will be established that day will all separate
but those who believe and do the right will be feasted in a rich wellwatered meadow
and those who disbelieved and belied our signs and the meeting in the hereafter they shall be brought back to the torment of the hereafter
so extol god when the evening comes and the day dawns
and his is the praise in the heavens and the earth and at nightfall and the time of noon
he brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and he revives the earth after its death
so will you be brought forth from the dead
and among his signs is that he created you of dust then lo you are mortals all scattered abroad
and among his signs is that he created among you adam and the ships in the sight of your own selves and the mountains he has made you love and made your friends
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect
and among his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variety of your tongues and complexions
surely in that are signs for a people who know
and of his signs is the night and the day and the ships sail by his command indeed in this are signs for people who listen
he shows you the lightning by way of fear and hope and sends down water from the sky and therewith revives the earth after it is dead
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and among his signs is that the heaven and the earth stand fast by his command and thereafter he will make you dwell in the earth after his command
all those who are in the heavens and the earth are his creatures in the same religion for a certain
and he is the first growth and the last
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
his is the highest description in the heavens and the earth and he is the allmighty the allwise
and he is the allmighty the allwise
god has struck a similitude a example of the people of the city as a servant then he has struck you with a thing justly and has not gone forth from your own selves in the case of those you associate with you then they will not share in
nay but the evildoers follow their own desires without knowledge
who is he that can guide him whom god allows to go astray
and they will have no protector against allah
so set your face towards the religion a man of pure faith with which he has sanctified and his deeds is the true faith
there is no altering of gods creation
that is the right religion but most men know not
but most men do not understand
say thou verily
turn to your lord and be a disbeliever in the oneness of allah
then when ye can not do it not and perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey allah and his apostle
even as those who have made divisions in their religion and become sects thou art sects in a divided chapter 19
and when harm touches men they cry sincerely only to their lord allah
then when he brought them to life lo a party of them turn aside from allah alone they associate partners with him in worship
so as to deny what we have bestowed on them
enjoy yourselves your short stay but you will come to know
or have we sent down to them any proof which therefore tells them of my partners
and when we cause mankind to taste of mercy they rejoice in it
but if some evil deeds they had done evil for what they had done in despair
do they not see that god increases or decreases the kingdom of whosoever he please
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
so give to the kindred his due and to almiskin the poor and to the wayfarer
that is best for those who seek his countenance and it is they who will be successful
and what you give in gift in order to gain the wealth that it may increase your wealth that it may give in alms and that what you give in it it is they who will get a little and what you give in charity – it is they
they will be in a double torment in the fire
it is god who created you then he will give you life then he will give you death
is there any of that of your associategods who doth aught of that
glory be to him
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
corruptness hath appeared on land and sea because of that which mens hands have earned so that he may make them taste a part of that which they have worked in order that haply they may return
say travel on the earth and see what was the end of those before you
most of them were mushrikun the disbelievers in the oneness of allah polytheists idolaters etc
so set your face towards the true straight and warn the day that will be no doubt of the day mankind will be upright and the dwellers of the blazing fire
whoever disbelieves then his disbelief is only over his disbelief
and those who believe and do righteous good deeds – for them are ranks and they are the successful
that he may reward those who believe and do good deeds by his munificence and be grateful
god does not love the unbelievers
and among his signs is that he sends the winds heralding glad tidings to make you taste his mercy and that he may warn you of his favours and that the ships may sail at his command
and assuredly we sent apostles before thee unto their people whom we sent revelations
we shall punish them with clear proofs but they committed sin
we have indeed found our help us against the believers
it is god who sends the breezes that raise clouds and spreads them over the sky as he please fold on fold then you see the drops of rain issue from between them and you see the drops of rain issue from between them then you see the rain
then they will be taken by it as a trial from among his slaves and they will be delighted at the fire
although before it was sent down upon them before that they had been in despair
look then allah brings the dead from the darkness of the desert after the death thereof thereupon he revives the earth after its death
verily he who gives life to the dead and he is able to do all things
and if we send a wind and they see their fields yellow because of it then indeed they would become ungrateful after their
verily thou canst not make the dead hear nor canst thou make the deaf hear the call when they flee turning their backs
nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray
you can make none hear except those who believe in our signs and have come to submission
it is god who created you weak then after weakness gave you strength then after strength gave you weakness and old age he creates whatever he wills he is able to do all things
he creates what he wills
he is allknowing and allpowerful
and on the day when the hour will be established the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc will swear that they stayed not but an hour thus were they ever deluded away from the truth
and those who have been vouchsafed knowledge and faith said you have indeed doubted the appointment of allah until the day of restoration but you did not know
that is the day of judgement but you will not know
the day when their excuses will be of no profit to the evildoers even as they did with no leave
and indeed we have illustrated all kinds of examples in this quran for mankind in order to remember ie this quran and in order to be a sign for mankind
even if you bring them a verse to them they will say you are nothing but a liar
thus doth allah put a seal upon the hearts of the ignorant
say thou verily
so be patient surely god is true
so let not those who have not certainty you have been given sight
alif lam mim
these are verses of the wise book
a book inscribed
those who perform assalat iqamatas salat and give zakat and they have faith in the hereafter with certainty
they are on guidance from their lord and will prosper
and of mankind is he who purchases idle talks ie music singing etc to mislead men from the path of allah without knowledge and takes it the path of allah the verses of the quran by way of mockery and takes them for mockery
these for them shall be a torment ignominious
and when our verses of the quran are recited to him he haughtily turns away as if he had never heard them as if they did not hear them as if they heard they had heard their faces in their traces
so announce to him a painful torment
verily those who believe and do righteous good deeds for them is an undiminished reward
they will abide in it for ever
god is the greatest ruler of all judges
and he is the allmighty the allwise
he created the heavens without pillars you can see and he has cast you into the earth firm mountains lest it move away with you and he has scattered therein moving living creatures as he has scattered
and we send down water from the heaven and we have cast mountains as anchors in it and gave it to every generous kind
these are they whom allah has cursed
so show me what those you worship besides him have created
nay the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers and those who do not believe in the oneness of allah are in plain error
and indeed we gave lokman wisdom give thanks to god
if you are grateful he is grateful he who is grateful for his own good and if you are grateful he is grateful
and whosoever strive striveth only for himself verily allah is rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
and remember when luqman said to his son and he used to advise him “ o my son do not ascribe any partner to allah indeed ascribing partners to him is a tremendous injustice ”
and we have enjoined on man to his parents his mother bore him in virtue and he was born of good and to me is your return and to me
and if they strive with thee to make thee associate with me that whereof thou hast no knowledge then do not obey them
“ so follow me and after it has become an insane ”
then unto me is your return and i shall declare unto you that which ye have been working
o my son if it be but the weight of a grain of mustardseed and though it be in the heavens or in the earth allah will bring it out of heaven and earth or in the heavens and the earth god will bring it forth
verily allah is subtle in bringing out that grain wellaware of its place
o my son perform the prayer and bid unto honour and forbid dishonour
and obey not thou the beliers
these are indeed acts of courage and resolve
and turn not away from men with pride nor walk with pride in insolence through the earth
verily allah likes not each arrogant boaster
and be moderate or show no insolence in your walking and lower your voice
surely the most repulsive voice is the donkeys
have you not seen how that god has subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and has lavished on you his blessings outward and inward and he has taught you some of you that you may know the favours of god and
and among mankind is he who disputes concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or a book giving light by allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book
and when it is said to them follow what god has revealed they say no one but we shall follow what we found our fathers doing
what even though he should call them to the chastisement of the burning
and whosoever submits his face himself to allah ie follows allahs religion of islamic monotheism worships allah alone with sincere faith in the 1 oneness of his lordship 2 oneness of his worship and 3 oneness of his names and qualities while he is a muhsin gooddoer ie performs
and to allah return all matters for decision
and whosoever disbelieveth let not his unbelief grieve thee
they will be brought back to us when we will tell them what they used to do
verily allah is the knower of that which is in the breasts
we let them enjoy for a while and we shall drive them to a severe torment
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say allah
say all the praises and thanks be to allah but most of them know not
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
who is he that can be a liar
if all the trees in the earth were pens and the seaseven seas after it to replenish it yet would god not help him in the heavens and the earth
god is mighty and wise
and your creation and your upraising are as though of one soul
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
hast thou not seen how that god makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and that god keeps the day to the day and that you bring forth the sun and the moon
every one of them swerved from the other until a period determined by gestation
god is aware of what you do
that is because allah he is the truth and that they call upon beside himit is the false and that which they invoke besides him is false
verily allah he is the high the most great
beholdest thou not that the ship saileth in the sea by the favour of allah that he may shew you of his signs
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and when he rescues them they call towards allah making their religion sincerely his sincere bondmen and when he has safely hidden they invoke him with him in the land he has safely hidden
and none gainsaith our signssave each perfidious ingrate one
o mankind fear your lord and do not let the good of his parent and the promise of god is true and let not the ever delude you and let not the deluder delude you concerning god
with god is the knowledge of the hour
he sends rain from the heavens and the earth he knows what is in the mothers wombs
god is allknowing and wellinformed
alif lam mim
the sending down of the book is from the lord of all being
or do they say he has forged it
in fact it is the truth from your lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you
they may haply be guided
he created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he established himself on the throne
and besides allah you have neither any wali protector or guardian nor any helper
will you not be warned even then
he disposeth every affair from the heaven unto the earth thereafter he shall ascend unto him in a day the measure whereof is a thousand years of your work
such is he the knower of the unknown and the known the mighty and the merciful
who made everything exceeding good deeds which he has made to man and he made good to him
then he made his offspring from semen of worthless water male and female sexual discharge
then he shaped him and breathed his spirit in him
and he gave you ears and eyes and hearts little thanks you give
and they say when we have mingled with the earth shall we be created anew
nay but they disbelieve in the encounter with their lord
say the angel of death who is set over you will take your souls then you will be returned to your lord
and if you see when the guilty will hang their heads before their lord saying our lord we have now seen and heard us have come back to guidance
we have seen and heard so send us back
we believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in his messenger muhammad saw
and if we listed surely we should have given every soul its guidance but my word is decreed surely that i shall fill gehenna with jinn and mankind together with jinn and mankind together
so taste the punishment for your deeds
we seduced you from the torment
taste the chastisement of eternity for that you were doing
only those believe in our signs who when they are reminded of them fall down prostrate and proclaim the praise of their lord and they are not proud
their sides shun their couches as much as they call on their lord they will be provided with them
no soul knows what comfort is laid up for them secretly as a recompense for that they used to do
is he who is a believer like him who is a transgressor
they are not equal
as for those who believe and do the right there are gardens for abode as welcome for what they did
and as for those who disobey their abode is hell
as often as they try to escape from it they will be dragged into it and told taste the torment of the fire which you used to deny
and we shall surely let them taste the nearer chastisement before the greater haply they will return
and who is a greater wrongdoer than he who is reminded of his signs then he turneth aside therefrom
we shall take vengeance upon the sinners
and indeed we gave moosa the book and made it known to the descendants of israel its book and its creation
and we appointed from among them leaders guiding by our command when they endured patiently and had sure faith in our signs
verily your lord will judge between them in what they differ
they were superior to them how many generations we destroyed before them in whose dwellingplaces they walk
surely in that are signs for a people who know
will they not then listen
do they not see that we drive the water to a land and bring forth crops therewith it was dead and they themselves eat from it
will they not then see
and they say when will this decision arrive if ye are truthtellers
say on the day of victory those who disbelieve will not be able to deny the least avail of those who do not be given a respite
so turn aside from them and await verily they too are waiting
o prophet fear allah and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites and do not follow their advices
god is allknowing and allwise
follow what is revealed to you by your lord
and allah is allaware of what you do
and put thy trust in allah and sufficeth allah as a trustee
allah hath not kept two hearts in the body of anyone who hath endeavoured after any way of rectitude
neither did your wives whom you declare to be like this nor did your fathers go forth in their mothers ’ wombs and you speak to them in truth
these are the limits ordained by allah so he will not be able to keep you astray
god says what is just and shows the right way
and when you see them their appearance would please you
this is more equitable in the sight of god
and if you know not their fathers they are your brothers in religion and your clients
there is no sin on you if you make a mistake therein except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
the prophet is not allowed unto the believers to marry their wives to whom the infidels past are they are themselves in case they are not aware of their own selves
and ibrahims abraham invoking of forgiveness invoking forgiveness for his father he was only because of a promise he had made to him and a promise of allah he had made to him
and blood relations among each other in the cause of allah and the muslims are nearer to one another in the brotherhood of the believers and the muhajirun emigrants way etc that you do not emigrate to the believers you call them to your friends but the believers you
except your friends with one another
this is in the book free of doubt and involution a great reward
and recall what time we took a bond from thee and we took from them the prophets and from thee the mount and we took compact with them and we sent forth from them the children of israel
that he may question the truthful concerning their truthfulness and he has prepared for the unbelievers a painful chastisement
o you who believe remember allahs favour upon you when an army came against you and we sent against them a wind and forces that you did not see them
and we sent against them a wind and forces them not
and allah is allseer of what you do
when they came upon you from above you and from above you and from below you and when the eyes became fixed in stare and the hearts reached the throats and you were imagining matters regarding allah
there the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking
and when tile hypocrites and those in whose hearts is sickness said god and his messenger promised us only delusion
and when a group among them said “ o people of medinah
and a part of them asked leave of the prophet saying our houses lie exposed yet they utter a part of the affair
they were indeed in manifest trial
they only wished to flee
and if the people of the city were asked to go journey and they were asked about it and they would have done it not hesitated thereupon a little
and arruredly they had already covenanted with allah that they would not turn their backs
and fulfil the covenant of allah
say thou flight shall not profit you if ye flee from death or slaughter and lo ye shall not be given except for a little
say who is he that will save you from god if he decide to afflict you or chastise you with a mercy
and they will not find for themselves besides allah a wali protector or supporter etc or any helper
god knows those of you who hinder and those who say to their brethren come to us and come to battle but seldom
being chary of helping you
and if you are on the earth we would have divided them into two groups among them is one of the other and we have not established you in the earth and we have indeed removed from them their enmity and hatred is sufficient for them is a party
when they come to you with their aid they do not have sense
so he made their deeds fruitless
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
they think that they are the enemies of their lord
they wish to be weak against you even though they were in the desert asking the confederates from your houses and if they were in the desert with you they would not have fought against you
and if they happen to be amongst you they would fight but little
indeed in the hope of allah and the last day and remembers allah much ranks for him who hopes in the meeting with allah and the last day and remembers allah much
and when the believers saw the confederates they said this is what allah and his apostle had promised us and allah and his apostle had spoken the truth
they said “ allah and his noble messenger has spoken the truth ”
and it only increased them in faith and submission
among the believers are men who have fulfilled that which they covenaned with allah
and among them are some who fulfilled the covenant with allah so some of them fulfilled their vows and some still wait – they are still waiting
and they will not be removed from them
that he may reward the truthful for their truthfulness and punish the hypocrites if he wills or give them repentance to them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
that he may destroy the unbelievers may not be wellpleased with it
they are still waiting
allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting by sending against the disbelievers a severe wind and troops of angels
god is allpowerful and allmighty
and he brought down from their strongholds those of the people of the scripture who backed them down from their strongholds
some of them killed and some you killed
and he caused you to inherit their lands and their houses and their riches and land which ye had not trodden before
and allah is able to do all things
o prophet say to your wives if you desire the present life and its glitter then come i will make a provision for you and set you free from divorce
but if you desire god his messenger and the home of the hereafter then god has prepared for those of you who believe and have prepared for the righteous among you a mighty wage
o wives of the prophet whosoever of you commits an act of clear shamelessness her punishment will be doubled
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
and whosoever of you is obedient to allah and his messenger and does righteous good deeds we shall remit from you her ie paradise and give her her reward in paradise
o prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him do not be like any one among you sick or if you fear him then speak to them the jews and the christians in whose heart is sickness and do not be like a screen herself
and remain in your houses and display not your finery as did the pagans of old
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and obey allah and his messenger
god desires to remove impurities from you o inmates of this house and to cleanse and bring out the best in you
and remember what is recited in your houses from allah ’s verses and wisdom indeed allah knows the minutest things is all aware
and allah is ever subtile aware
verily the muslim men and muslim women and the believing men and the believing women and the devout men and the believing women and the men and the women who are obedient to allah believing men and the humble women and the devout men and the women of the
it is not for a believer man or woman when god and his messenger have decreed a believer and the believing men and women
and whosoever disobeyeth allah and his apostle hath strayed with a manifest straying
and when you said to him zaid bin harithah the freedslave of the prophet saw on whom allah has bestowed grace by guiding him to him ie islam whom allah has bestowed grace of islamic monotheism and you did fear him ie divorced wife of the prophet saw and
but god does not withdraw his pledge
so when zaid had accomplished his desire from her we gave her to you in marriage so that you may not fear them and in accordance with their adopted sons when they have performed their purpose
and allah will destroy the souls and the believers
there is no sin on him whether he should take away something in which he has decreed
this has been the way of god with those who have passed away before and gods wo nt of old
god will surely accomplish a matter already in front of us
those who when they are told privately and fear god and keep their secret counsels and fear none save him
and sufficient is allah as a reckoner
muhammad is not the father of any one of your males but he is not one of you
except the chosen slaves of allah faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
and allah is the allknower of everything
o you who believe remember god much
and glorify his praises morning and afternoon the early morning fajr and asr prayers
it is he who blesses you and his angels to bring you out of darkness into light and into darkness into light
and allah is most merciful to the believers
their greeting on the day they meet him will be peace
and he has prepared for them a generous reward ie paradise
o prophet we have sent you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him as a witness and a herald of glad tidings and warnings
and as a caller towards allah by his leave and as a sun that enlightens the holy prophet is a light from allah
and give glad tidings to the believers that for them is allah ’s extreme munificence
and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites and harm them not
so turn away from them
and allah is ever allsufficient as a disposer of affairs
o you who believe when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them so there is no waitingperiod from you incumbent on them that you should count them
o prophet we have made lawful for you o muhammad saw as wives of your wives whom you have given their dower and godgiven maids they possess and daughters of your fathers sisters and daughters of your fathers sisters and daughters of your wives and daughters of your fathers
and we d the believers their wives and the bondwomen that they possess whom we have enjoined upon the believers
and we know that you know not whether you have agreed with them honourably or not marry them in a case of their right hands won in order that you may not cease to be merciful
you may defer the turn of any of your wives you like and may take any other you may take any of them you desire
there is no sin on you if you take any of these you have given them if you give them their mahr bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage which you give them
this is likelier to cool their eyes and not let them grieve and to keep them pleased with them
god knows what is in your hearts
god is pardoning and forgiving
you have no other women except what is permitted to you
and allah is ever a watcher over all things
o you who believe enter not the houses except for a meal without awaiting the same as to which you have given leave and enter the houses of the prophet saw in the morning
and when you are invited enter and when you have had taken your meal disperse neither lingering for idle talk that is hurtful to the prophet and he is ashamed before you but when you are invited then enter and enter into the houses of the meal disperse without
this is a promise from your lord and he is indeed forbearing
and allah is not unaware of your deeds
and when you ask them for something you ask them for a screen that is purer for your hearts
this is their hearts and their hearts were submissive to you
it is not in the least to disrespect him is blasphemy
whether you discuss a thing or conceal it surely god has knowledge of everything
there is no sin on them if they come to their fathers or their sons or their brothers sons or their brothers or their sisters sons or their brothers or their brothers or their sisters sons or their own believing women
and fear allah
verily allah is witness over everything
god and his angels shower their blessings on the prophet
say “ peace ”
verily those who oppose allah and his noble messenger muhammad saw allah will have cursed them in this world and in the hereafter and has prepared for them a humiliating torment
and those who unnecessarily harass muslim men and women have burdened themselves with slander and open sin
o prophet tell your wives and daughters and the women of the faithful to draw their wraps a little over them
this is more suitable than the sight of allah
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease we shall make you overpower them then we shall not put you in the city except a little while then they will be continued in the fire
accursed wherever found they shall be seized and killed with a terrible slaughter
that hath been the way of allah with those who have passed away before and verily allah hath been in the way of allah
and thou shalt never find any changing the wo nt of god
people ask you about the hour of the great change
say the knowledge thereof is with god alone
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
god has cursed the unbelievers and prepared for them a blaze
they will abide in it for ever and will find no saviour or helper
on the day when their faces are turned on the fire they will say “ alas – if only we had obeyed allah and obeyed the noble messenger ”
and they will say our lord verily we obeyed our chiefs and our great ones and they misled us from the right way
our lord give them double torment and curse them with a mighty curse
o you who believe
and allah hath not kept an malice him unto his apostle and allah is hearing knowing
with him is the great reward
o you who believe fear allah and speak rightly
he will rectify your conduct for you and forgive you your sins
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle he hath indeed achieved a mighty achievement
we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to carry it and man carried it on the same man was shameful and man carried it
in order that allah may punish the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women and the polytheist men and the polytheist women and the polytheist women and accept faith in allah and accept faith in allah only and accept faith the repentance of allah and allah is the most acceptor
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
all praise be to god to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
and he is the allwise the allknower
he knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it what comes down from the heaven and what ascends thereto
he is the forgiving the merciful
the unbelievers say the hour will not come to us
say yes by my lord it will come to you
and nothing is hidden in the earth or in the heaven and the weight of an atom or in the heavens or in the earth or in the sky escapes from him
all things conform to a manifest law
that he may reward those who believe and do good deeds by his leave and do good deeds
for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
and those who strive against our signs in order to defeat will be brought into the punishment of painful punishment
those who have been given the knowledge see that what is sent down to you muhammad saw from your lord and believe in what has been revealed to you and in what was revealed to you from your lord they will surely believe in it and in what has
and the disbelievers said “ shall we point you to a man who is in open error ”
has he invented a lie against allah or is he possessed
nay but those who disbelieve in the hereafter are themselves in a torment and in far error
have they not seen what is before them and what is behind them of heaven and the earth
if we will we can bury them in the earth or cause a piece of the heaven to fall on them
verily in this is a sign for every faithful believer that believes in the oneness of allah and turns to allah in all affairs with humility and in repentance
and we softened for him iron
make long coats of mail we said and fix their links and do the right
o people of david act
i am observant of what you do
and sulaiman solomon disbelieved so the case of the months continuously pursuing them and they will have fallen into the dawn
and of the jinn were some who worked before him by the leave of his lord and of them were some who were deemed weak in the land and others fighting in allahs cause
and whosoever of them swerved from our command him we shall cause to taste the torment of the blaze
they made for him whatever he wished sanctuaries statues bowls like pools and heavy cauldrons
and say not three trinity
but few among my creatures are thankful
then when we decreed death to him naught discovered his death to him except a moving creature of them
when the council of the jinn were speaking of a humbling chastisement
indeed there was a sign in the former people
eat of the lawful and good provision for you and be grateful to him
and a compensation slaughtered for your lord that is haroon
but they turned away then we sent them with a painful torment
so we let loose upon them gardens of dates and grapes upon them because of their evil deeds
thus we recompensed them for their unbelief and do we ever recompense any hut the unbeliever
and we have placed between them and the cities which we had blest cities easy to be seen and we have made several leaders
and we said to them travel in the land and see what was the end of those who denied the truth
but they said our lord make the distance between our journeys longer and they wronged themselves
so we turned them into bygone tales and dispersed them scattered in all directions
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
iblis proved true his opinion of them and they followed him except a party of the believers
but a party of the believers follow only surmise merely conjecturing
he had no authority over them except that he might know who believes in the hereafter and who is in doubt about it
and thy lord is over everything a warden
say call on god and those you associate with him god
they are not masters even of the earth nor in the heavens and the earth they have neither a helper apart from them
and there is no intercession except with him whom he permits
that he may make you flee from the admonition that you may give thought
they will say what is the day of justice
they will say the truth
and he is the most high the most great
say who gives you food from the heavens and the earth
say god
or in apparent words verily we are in plain error
say you will not be questioned about their sins neither shall we be questioned as to what you do
say our lord will gather us together and judge between us equitably
he is the deliverer the allknowing
say show me those you associate with him as compeers
by no means
he is allmighty and allwise
and we have not sent thee save as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner unto mankind but most of mankind know not
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say thou the appointment to you is for a hour nor a hour doubt
and those who disbelieve say we shall by no means believe in this quran nor in the past nation before it
if only you could see when the evildoers are stationed before their lord bandying argument the one against the other if you would see the believers would be haughty in the least
those who were conceited will say to those who were subdued “ did we stop you from the guidance after it came to you
nay but you were mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disobedient to allah etc
those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant nay but it is these who were stiffnecked certainly we have physical affliction of them and those who believed in allahs book before them
and they will see when they see the torment
we shall put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved
they shall be requited not save according to that which they had been working
never did we send a warner but with a city that its men might refuse to believe in what was sent with
and they say we are more abundant in wealth and children and we shall not be chastised
say verily my lord increases or restricts the provision of whosoever he please but most men do not know
it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you back to us
except those who believe and do the right they will be in gardens of paradise as a reward for what they did
and those who strive in our signs in order to defeat will be brought into the punishment
say verily my lord increases or restricts the provision of any of his creatures as he wills
and whatever you spend in the cause of allah he will replace it
and on the day when he will gather them all together he will say to the angels was it you these people who were serving
they will say glory be to thee
nay but they used to worship the jinns
most of them believed in them
so today none of you shall have power to profit or hurt one another
and we shall say to the evildoers taste the chastisement of the fire which you cried lies to
and when our clear verses are recited to them they say “ this is nothing but a man who wishes to turn you away from your gods ”
and when the truth is come to them the blasphemers say of the truth when it has come to them this is nothing but pure sorcery
and we have not sent down to them any book before this they should be sent down any warner
so had those before them denied – therefore how did my rejection turn out
say i urge you to stand upon one thing that you stand up in pairs of the shadows and the land and you look not to be a warner for it is no madness in your comrade he is naught but a warner to you
he is but a terrible chastisement
say i do not ask of you a wage for this
my reward is only from god and god
and he is of everything a witness
say my lord casts the truth
the all knowing of every hidden
and say truth has come and falsehood nullified
so the falsehood comes up to nothing but an empty plain or a woman
say i will not follow your vain desires if i go astray i will not be astray
nun
and couldst thou see the time when they shall be terrified
they will never find a way of escape from the punishment
and they say we believe in it
but they are called from a place far away
they disbelieved in it before and they were in a place of safety from a distant place
and a barrier will be set between them and what they desire as was done with their partisans before them
and a barrier is set between them and what they have been promised is already decided between them and them indeed they are in doubt concerning the graves
all praise be to god the originator of the heavens and the earth who appointed angels as his messengers with wings two three and four
he increases in creation what he wills
verily allah is able to do all things
whatever mercy god opens to men none can withhold and whatever he withholds none can loose after him
and he is the allmighty the allwise
o mankind remember allahs favour on you
is not allah best for you to provide you sustenance from the sky and the earth
there is no god but he
whither away then are ye deviating
and if they belie you o muhammad saw so were messengers belied before you
and to allah return all matters for decision
god is the truth of all being truthful
the present life is no doubt of the world to come
so let not the life of the world beguile you and let not beguile you with great works
verily shaitan satan is an enemy to you so take treat him as an enemy
he calls his party only that they may be among the inhabitants of the blaze
those who disbelieve theirs shall be a torment severe and those who believe and work righteous works theirs shall be forgiveness and a great hire
is he then whose evil of his work hath been made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it be as he who rightly perceiveth the truth
god leads whosoever he wills astray and guides whosoever he will
so do not waste yourself sorrowing over them
god comprehends what they do
it is god who sends the winds so that they raise clouds and then we drive them towards a dead land and they see
and we drive the clouds towards the land that was dead and restore the earth to life after its death
even so
whosoever desires honour power and glory then to allah belong all honour power and glory
and throw down what is in your right hand
then he accepted their repentance
and as for the unjust they shall be punished for the like of it and the punishment of the fire will be their faces and they will have none to help them against allah
god created you of dust then of a spermdrop then he made you pairs
no fruit comes out of its sheath nor does a female conceive within her womb nor brings forth young except by his knowledge
and is in a book allauh almahfuz
verily that is easy for allah
and the two seas are not alike this sweet thirst quenching pleasant to drink and that saltish and bitter
and from among them is a sign for you that you eat fresh meat from it ornaments that you wear
and thou beholdest ships ploughing therein and that thou mayest turn aside from them that haply ye may seek his grace and that haply ye may give thanks
he brings the night in a part of the day and brings the day in a part of the night and he has subjected the sun and the moon each runs its fixed course for its course
every one of them swerved from the other until a period determined by gestation
such is allah your lord
and those whom ye call upon beside him own not even a qitmir the thin membrane over the datestone
if you call upon them they will not hear your prayer and if they heard they could not answer you
and on the day of resurrection he will call to them and they will deny their partners
allah is not allknower the allaware of them
o mankind ye are needers unto allah and allah and allah he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
if he wills he can take you away and bring a new creation
and this is not hard for allah
no burdened soul laden bears the burden of another
and no one who carries a burden bears anothers load and even if one heavily burdened soul will carry another
you can warn only those who fear their lord unseen and perform the prayer
he who purifies himself by avoiding polytheism and accepting islamic monotheism shall achieve success
and allah is ever unto you ever is the final return
not equal are the blind and the seeing nor the deaf and the blind and the seeing man ie those who are deaf and the seeing and the dead are not equal to those who do not listen
nor darkness and light
nor are alike the shade and the suns heat
nor alike are the living and the dead
god increases in them the way he please
verily allah makes whom he wills hear but you can not make those who are in their graves listen to guidance
you o muhammad saw are only a warner ie your duty is to convey allahs message to mankind but the guidance is in allahs hand
we have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn
never a community that did not have a community but it was a warner had passed
and if they belie thee then surely those before them belied and surely they belied
then i seized the unbelievers then how was my retribution
beholdest thou not that allah sendeth down water from the heaven and then we thereby bring fruit of diverse colours and in the mountains are steaks white and red of diverse colours and also intensely black
and of men and beasts and cattle likewise of diverse colours
only those of his creatures fear god who have knowledge
verily allah is oftforgiving most ready to appreciate the deeds of those who are obedient to him
verily allah is sure to declare unto them that which we have ordained in the heavens and the earth and in the prayer and in the hope of our sight and in order that they may not be convinced
that he may pay them their wages in full and give them more out of his grace
he is the best provider
and what we have inspired in you o muhammad saw of the book is the truth confirming what preceded it in it
and allah is allaware and allseer of his slaves
then we made those of our creatures whom we had given the book had blessed and some of them are righteous and some are the inheritors
that is the supreme grace
adn eden paradise everlasting gardens will they enter therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments there will be of silk ie in paradise
and they will say all the praises and thanks be to allah who has removed from us all grief
verily our lord is oftforgiving most ready to appreciate good deeds and to recompense
who has settled us in the mansions of the world and has caused the arrogant to enter into the land no weariness will come to us
and for the infidels is the fire of hell
it shall not be decreed to them nor shall they be suffered to make for them an ignominious torment
thus we requite every ingrate
they will cry o lord
“ we shall now cause a better than the entire household ”
did we not give you long enough so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive admonition therein and that he has destroyed you with the likes thereof
and there has come to you a warner
so taste the punishment because you used to disbelieve
and for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is no helpers
verily allah is the allknower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth
he knows what is in the hearts of men
it is he who made you successors in the earth
whoever disbelieves then his disbelief is only over his disbelief
and for the infidels their infidelity increaseth with their lord naught save abhorence and for the infidels their infidelity increastth naught save loss
say o muhammad saw tell me what think you if you call upon apart from god show me what they have created of the earth
or have they7 any partnership in the heavens
or have we given them a book so that they worship him as a clear proof from allah
but the wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusions
verily allah withholdeth the heavens and the earth lest they cease and should they cease not any one feels secure
and if we willed they would not have taken away their own substitute for them any one other
he is indeed forbearing and forgiving
they swore by allah most vehemently in their oaths that if any noble messenger came to them they would be more rightly guided than any other communities like those who were given to the guidance
and when there came to them a warner in paradise they said we shall not increase aught save in the least
this is in the land and the event that terrifies the hearts
but the evil scheming overwhelms none but to avert it
and you will not find any change in the way of allah
have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them
and allah is not such that anything in the heavens and the earth can break away from him
he is allknowing and allpowerful
and if allah were to seize mankind for their doings he would not leave a single moving creature on the earth but he gives them respite till a term appointed
so when their time is come surely god sees his servants
yasin
by the wise koran
you are indeed one of the noble messengers
on a straight path
this is a book sent down by arabic tongue that you may warn a people whose ancestors are not warned so that they may be warned
a revelation that is sent down by the allmighty the allwise
and indeed the word of punishment has proved true against most of them so they will not believe
and that he may behold it nigh to the believers
we have put shackles around their necks reaching up to the chins so that their heads are forced up
and we have put a barrier before them and a barrier behind them and we have covered them up so that they may know not
so they will not be able to do them
alike it is to them whether thou hast warned them or thou hast not warned them they do not believe
you can only warn him who follows the reminder the quran and fears the most beneficent allah unseen
so give him the glad tidings of forgiveness and a generous reward
verily we will guicken the dead and we write down that which they send before and their footsteps
and everything we have numbered in a book luminous
and relate to them the signs of the people of the city when the messengers came to it
when we sent them two messengers to them in the midst of their cave
we sent them tokens to bring them a binding upon them
they said you are only human beings like ourselves and you are not believers
they said our lord knows that we have been sent to you
and on us is naught but manifest preaching
they said we augur ill of you
if you do not desist we shall stone you and inflict a grievous punishment on you
they said your evil augury is with you
is it a sign for you
in fact you are a people who exceed the limits ”
and there came a man from the farthest part of the town a man running he said o my people obey the messengers
follow those who ask not of you for any hire and who are rightly guided
what aileth me that ye succour me not one who hath created me
and to him you shall be returned
he said “ shall i seek a god other than god ”
if the most gracious has forgiven me nor can they be able to save me
in that case i should indeed be in manifest error
i believe in your lord so listen to me
i believe in your lord so listen to me
it was said to him enter paradise and he said if my lord has forgiven me and made me of the honoured ones
he said “ my lord has forgiven me and has placed me among the honoured ”
and we sent not against his people after him a host from heaven nor do we send such a thing
it was just one scream and with it they were extinguished
alas for men
and never came a messenger to them but they used to mock at him
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them who will not return again
and without exception all of them will be brought forth before us
and a sign for them is the dead land we quicken it and therecut we bring forth grain so that thereof they eat
and we have placed therein gardens of datepalms and grapes and we have caused springs of water to gush forth therein
so that they may eat from its fruits whereas they are not manufactured by their hands
will they not then give thanks
glory be to god who has created all things that they know not
and a sign for them is the night we strip the day out of it thereupon they are in darkness
and the sun runs on its course for a term appointed
and the moon we have determined by stations till it returns like an aged palmbough
it is not for the sun to catch up with the moon nor does the night surpass the day and each one of them floats in its orbit
and a sign for them is that we lodged them in a laden ship while they were in their forefathers backs
and we have created for them of the like thereunto whereon they ride
and if we will we shall drown them and there will be no shout or helper for them nor will they hear
unless by our benevolence to reap advantage for a time
and fear allah and listen to them in what they may in their state
and never does a sign come to them from among the signs of their lord except that they turn away from it
and when it is said to them spend in charity from what we have provided you with good things and say to those who disbelieve say if allah had so willed we would not have taken away the believers
you are only in palpable error
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you speak the truth
they await just one scream which will overcome them while they are involved in worldly disputes
then they will not be able to make bequest nor they will return to their family
and the trumpet will be blown and lo from the tombs unto their lord they will be hastening
saying alas for us
who roused us out of our sleeping place
this is what the most gracious had promised and he has acquired
the messengers said the truth “ the messengers used to say ”
it will be but one shout and lo they will all be brought together before us
today you will be requited not save for what you did
verily the dwellers of the paradise that day will be busy in joyful things
they and their spouses in shade on couches shall be reclining
therein they will have fruits and whatever they ask for
peace such is the greeting from a lord allcompassionate
and separate yourselves this day o ye culprits
o children of adam did i not serve you o you assembly that this is a clear foe to you
and that you shall worship me this is the straight path
and indeed he satan did lead astray many a great multitude of you
did you not understand
this is hell that you were promised
roast in it today for that you were unbelievers
this day we shall seal up their mouths and their hands will speak to us and their legs will bear witness against what they used to earn
and if we listed surely we should wipe out their eyes so that they would struggle for the way how then would they see
and if we listed surely we should transform them in their places so that they would be able
and whomsoever we grant long life we reverse him in creation
will you not then understand
and we have not taught him muhammad saw poetry nor is it meet him
this is only revelation communicated
that he may warn him who is alive and feels secure
have they not seen how we have created for them of what our hands have fashioned by our power
and we have subdued them unto them so that some of them they have not been able to protect them
and they have therefrom other benefits and drinks
will they not then give thanks
and they have taken for worship aliha gods other than allah that they might be helped
they can not help them and their armies will come to them
and let not their speech grieve thee
we know what they hide and disclose
beholdest not man that we have created him from a sperm yet lo he is an open quarreller
and he puts forth for us a parable and forgets his own creation he says who will give life to these bones when they have rotted away and became dust
say he who created them for the first time
he is the allknower of every creation
who giveth you out of the green tree fire and lo ye kindle therewith
is not he who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them
yes indeed
he is the allknower of everything
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
blessed be he in whose hand is the dominion of everything and he is the allwise the allknower
and to him you shall be returned
by the angels ranged in ranks or rows
and by oath of those who herd with a stern warning
by the angels reciting the praise
verily your god is one
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and lord of the easts
and we have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps stars to be an adornment as well as to guard from the devils by using them as missiles against the devils
and to guard against every rebellious devil
they can not listen to the exalted assembly and they are darted at from every side
there is perpetual punishment for them
except the saying “ the word of allah – the tradition of the former people is nothing but a great one ”
so ask them o muhammad saw are they stronger in constitution or those we created
we created them of clinging clay
nay you o muhammad saw wondered at their insolence while they mock at you and at the quran
and when they are reminded they pay no attention
and when they see a sign they mock at it
and they say this is nothing but manifest sorcery
when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we indeed be raised up
and also our forefathers
say yes and you shall then be of those brought nigh
it will be but a single saihah shout etc so behold they will be unable to go up
saying alas for us
this is the day of judgement
this is the day of judgement which you used to deny
and it will be said to the angels take them away from allah
god shall gather them all together
and halt them to be questioned
what aileth you that ye succour not
nay but they will be in surrender
and some of them inclined towards others mutually questioning
they will say verily ye ye were wo nt to come unto us imposing
they will say nay you yourselves were not believers
we had no authority over you in fact you were a people who were mujrimun criminals disobedient polytheists sinners
so now the sentence of our lord has come true to us we will certainly have to taste the torment
we seduced you astray verily we ourselves were ourselves the seduced ones
so they will be screened off that day of resurrection
thus do we deal with the mujrimun polytheists disbelievers sinners criminals etc
and when it is said to them “ allah there is no god except him ” they grew arrogant
and they said are we going to abandon our aliha gods for the sake of a mad poet
in fact he has brought the truth and testified for the noble messengers
you will surely be requited for what you had done
and be rewarded but only for what you had done
except the chosen slaves of allah faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
for them is a known provision
and they will be honoured
in gardens of peace
sitting on couches face to face
with goblets ready placed shall be passed around them
white delicious to the drinkers
no headiness there shall be therein nor shall they be therewith inebriated
and with them are the pure spouses who do not set gaze upon men except their husbands of single age
as if they were eggs safely hidden
and some of them draw near to others questioning
one of them says i had a comrade
who used to say are you among those who believe in resurrection after death
when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we then indeed be raised up
he said will you look down
he therefore looked down and saw him amidst the blazing fire
he said by allah you certainly tried me
and but for the favourcf my lord i should have been of those brought forward
there is no getting away death nor can we be our life
except our first creation and we shall not be punished by the dead and we are not going to be punished
that is the supreme achievement
for the like of this let the workers work
is this better as a hospitality or the tree of ezzakkoum
we have indeed made this qur’an a punishment for the unjust
it is a tree that comes forth in the root of hell
the shoots of its fruitstalks are like the heads of shayatin devils
they will eat and fill their bellies with it
then thereafter verily on top of it they will have a brew of boiling water
then their return is to hell
verily they found their fathers gone astray
and they run in their footsteps
and assuredly there went stray before them many of the ancients
and indeed we sent among them warners messengers
so behold what wise hath been the end of those who were warned
except the chosen slaves of allah faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
and indeed nuh noah invoked us and we are the best of those who answer the request
and we rescued him and his people from the great calamity
and we made his seed the survivors
and we left for him among the posterity
peace be upon noah among all beings
thus do we reward the virtuous
he was among our believing servants
then we drowned the others
and abraham indeed was of his inducement
when he came to his lord with a heart compliant
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
is it a falsehood aliha gods other than allah that you seek
what then is your opinion of the lord of the worlds
then he turned away privately
and he said verily i am sick with plague he did this trick to remain in their temple of idols to destroy them and not to accompany them to the pagans feast
but they turned their backs on him and went away
then he turned to their gods and said why do you not eat
what is the matter with you that you do not say
then he turned upon them striking them with his right hand
so the disbelievers came running towards him
he said worship ye that which carve
and allah hath created you and that which ye make
they said build for him a building and cast him into the furnace
and they plotted a plot against him but we made them the lowest
and he said verily i am going to my lord who will guide me
he said my lord verily he is a son and he was among the righteous
we therefore gave him the glad tidings of an intelligent son
and when he had reached the age of running with him he said o my son i dreamt that i am sacrificing you
what is the matter with you how can you do not know
i have no right to say what is your god to you
then when they had submitted themselves to allah and he took his forehead or on his side
we called out to him o abraham
you have fulfilled the dream vision
verily we thus we recompense the welldoers
this is indeed an evident grace from allah
and we ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice
and we left for him among the posterity
peace be upon abraham
thus do we reward the virtuous
he was among our believing servants
and we gave him the glad tidings of ishaq a herald of the hidden from among those who deserve our proximity
and we blessed him and isaac
among their descendants are some who do wrong and some that are unjust and others are unjust
and indeed we gave moosa and haroon also our brother haroon
and we delivered them and their people from the great distress
and we helped them so that they became the victors
and we gave them the clear scripture
and guided them to the straight path
and we left for them among the posterity
peace be upon moses and aaron
thus do we reward the virtuous
they are two of our believing servants
and verily iliyas elias was one of the messengers
“ and you do not worship anyone except allah your lord and the lord of your forefathers ”
would ye call on baal and leave the best of creators
god your lord and the lord of your fathers the ancients
but they denied him iliyas elias so they will certainly be brought forth to the punishment
except the chosen slaves of allah faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
and we left for him among the posterity
peace be upon elias
thus do we reward the virtuous
he was among our believing servants
and verily lout lot was one of the messengers
when we saved him and his family all
except an old woman among those who stayed behind
then we destroyed the others
and in the morning you would not have made their dwellings to read it
and at night will you not then reflect
and verily yunus was one of the messengers
when he fled on the laden ship
he agreed to cast lots and he was among the losers
and the believers were also lost in pride
then the whale swallowed him down and he blameworthy
and had allah not been one of those who hallow him
he would have tarried in its belly until the day when all will be raised
then he turned them to a plain level
and we grew a tree of gourd as a shelter above him
we sent him to a hundred thousand men or more
and they believed we gave them enjoyment for a time
now ask them o muhammad saw are there only daughters for your lord and sons for them
or did we create the angels females while they were witnesses
lo verily it is of their falsehood that they say
god has begotten
they are indeed liars
has he chosen daughters above sons
what ails you then how you judge
will you not then contemplate
or have you received some clear authority
then bring your book if you speak truly
and they have invented a kinship between him and the jinns a kinship
and they have indeed done with the jinn and they know that they will soon know
hallowed be allah from that which they ascribe to him
except the chosen slaves of allah faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
so neither are you serving what you serve
can you not see any one except him whom allah has created all things
except one who will be roasted in the fire
and we are those who sing hallelujas to him
and we are the rangers
verily there are for them high ranks before him
if we had the account of earlier people with us
if we had the account of earlier people with us
we would have been the chosen creatures of god
but they disbelieved in it and in the oneness of allah
again no one but must come to know
already our word has preceded to our servants the envoys
that they would be helped
and that our hosts they verily would be the victors
so return them to a time
and watch them
and watch them for they will soon see
they seek haste then they to hasten on
when it lights in their courtyard how evil will be the morning of them that are warned
so turn thou from them for a time
and watch them
and watch them for they will soon see
hallowed be thine lord the lord of glory from that which they ascribe to him
and peace be upon the envoys
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
sad
by the glorious koran
saad – by oath of the renowned qur’an alphabet of the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
how many generations have we destroyed before them
then the shout is only allahs punishment and lo
and they arab pagans wonder that there has come to them muhammad saw from among themselves after we are dead and become dust and bones are we indeed going to be requited
has he made the aliha gods all into one ilah god allah
this is indeed a strange thing
the chiefs among them departed saying go to your aliha gods
this is a promise in truth and a fabrication
we have not heard of this among the people of the city
this is only revelation communicated
what has the remembrance been sent down to him out of us all
nay but they are in doubt about my admonition
or do they hold the treasures of the mercy of your lord the allmighty the real bestower
or is theirs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them so that they can outstrip
then let them climb up the ladders to the heavens
a party of the confederates only to be defeated
before them the people of nooh and the tribe of a’ad and the thamud and the people of lut denied their noble messengers so my people denied them therefore my fate proved true
and the thamud and the people of lut and the dwellers of the wood these were the confederates
each one of them denied the messengers so my threat became inevitable
they await just one scream which no one can avert
and they say our lord hasten our portion unto us before the day of reckoning
so be patient verily he is a great reward
verily we were subjected to him the mountains that was with him in the night and at the ends of day and at the prostrations
and the birds gathered together they were all obedient to him
and we strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and decisive speech
when they entered upon david and they came to him they said fear not
when they entered in the company of david he was startled by them
they said fear not verily we are two classes
judge between us with equity and do not make us two just and guide us to the right way
this man here is my brother he has ninety and nine ewes while i have only one
this is my brother he has ninety nine ewes while i have only one ewe and he now says hand it over to me
daud said assuredly he hath wronged thee in asking for thy ewe in addition to his sheep and indeed most of them wronged themselves
but as for those who believe and do righteous deeds and do righteous good deeds they will be little
and we tried him by the means of trying him but he repented and turned to god and turned to him again and turned to god in repentance
we are the rangers
and verily for him is an approach with us and a happy end
o dawud
we have appointed you a viceroy in the earth
so judge between men equitably and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of god
verily those who wander astray from the path of allah will have a severe torment
and we have not created the heaven and the earth and all that is between them unnecessarily
so woe to the unbelievers for the fire
shall we equate those who do the right with those who spread corruption in the land
shall we equate the pious with the guilty
this is a book we have sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him so that they may ponder its verses and that they may ponder
and sulaiman solomon and we bestowed on david who was an excellent devotee always turning in repentance
when the night is over him in the day when he calls to him that he is in the land and the standing steeds
so leave them to their vain disputes and amusement
bring them back to me
and he began to stroke their shanks and necks
and we tried solomon and we cast upon his throne a mere body
then he turned back striving in his effort
he said my lord forgive me and give me judgment and thou art the giver
we subjected the wind to him at his command wherever he wills
and we subjected to him the jinns every kind of builder and diver
and also others bound in fetters
this is our gift bestow or withhold without reckoning
and verily for him is an approach with us and a happy end
and remember our slave ayub job when he invoked his lord saying verily
recall what time he cried unto his lord verily the satan hath touched me with distress and distress by touched me with affliction
stamp thy foot with thy foot yonder is water to wash in cool and water to drink
so i swear by the afterglow of sunset
and we bestowed on him lshaq and ya qub as a grandson and each one we made righteous
take a handful of herbs we said to him and apply and rub them and do not make a mistake
verily
we found him patient
we found him patient
verily he was ever oftreturning in repentance to us
and remember our slaves ibrahim abraham ishaque isaac and yaqub jacob all owners of strength in worshipping us and also of religious understanding
we distinguished them with a distinct quality the remembrance of the abode
and in our sight they are of the chosen the excellent
and ismail ishmael and idris enoch and dhulkifl isaiah all were from among assabirin the patient ones etc
this is a clear favour from him
for those who fear god there is an excellent reward and an excellent abode
gardens of eden with gates open wide to them
therein they will recline therein they will call for fruits in abundance and drinks
and with them will be virgins of refraining looks and of equal age
this is what you were promised for the day of reckoning
this is our provision there will surely be no ceasing thereof
this is for the virtuous and indeed for the rebellious is a wretched destination
for them is hell a prison and a destination
and what a wretched place to return
this is so let them taste it boiling water and pus
and other torments like thereof conjoined
this is a troop rushing in with you there is no welcome for you
they are not able to receive them
they will roast in the fire
the followers will say “ in fact it is you who will never be able to get you first to be repaid for it ”
they will say you are envious of our gain
they will say our lord whoso forwarded this for us give him a double chastisement in the fire
and they will say what is the matter with us that we see not men whom we counted among the wicked
and we took hold of them in mockery and the things they wrought
or did he think that our hands will not hold them for anything with them or that they are earning
this is indeed an utmost certainty
say i am only a warner
there is no god but one god the one the omnipotent
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the allmighty the allforgiving
say that this quran is a great news
from which you are turning away
i had no knowledge of the chiefs angels on high when they were disputing and discussing about the creation of adam
only this has been inspired to me that i am a plain warner
when your lord said to the angels i am going to create a man from clay
and when i have fashioned him and breathed into him of my spirit fall down prostrating with him
so the angels prostrated themselves all of them together
except iblis he refused and was proud and was among the disbelievers
said allah “ o iblis what preventeth you from prostrating before one whom i have created with both my hands
becomest thou stiffnecked or art thou of the exalted ones
he said i am better than he thou createdst me of fire and him thou createdst of clay
he said i am better than he you created me from fire and him thou createdst of clay
said he get thee forth therefrom verify thou art driven away
“ and you are accursed ”
and verily my curse is on you till the day of recompense ie the day of resurrection
he said my lord respite me till the day they shall be raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
till the day of the time appointed
he said by thy majesty then i shall surely seduce them all together
except your chosen slaves amongst them faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
said he this is the truth and i speak
i will fill hell with you iblis that i will fill hell with you iblis that i will fill hell with jinn and men all together
say i do not ask of you a wage for this nor am i of the things that do
it is only a reminder for all the people of the world
and you will come to know its tidings after a while
the revelation of this book is from allah the most honourable the wise
we have sent down to you the book with the truth so worship god devoting yourself to him
lo for allah is the religion exclusive
and those who take protectors and helpers besides him say we worship them that they may bring us nearer to god than that
verily allah will judge between them in what they differ
god does not guide the disbelieving people
had god desired to take a son he could have chosen whatever he willed
glory be to him exalted be he above that they associate with him
he is god the one the omnipotent
he created the heavens and the earth with deliberation and gave the alternation of night and day and makes the day to go in the night and he has subjected the day for a stated term
and he it is who hath subjected to you the sun and the moon and the stars are subjected by his command
he is the mighty the forgiver
he created you of a single cell
and his wife and his brother
he has sent down for you eight pairs of the sheep two male and female and of the goats two male and female of the goats two male and female
he creates you in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation in threefold darkness
such is allah your lord
there is no god but he
how then are you perverted
if you disbelieve then remember that you were given the scripture jews and christians
and he is the most gracious the most kind of thanks
and if you are grateful he will not return to him
that no burdened person with sins shall bear the burden sins of another
thereafter unto your lord is your return and he will declare unto you that which ye have been working
verily allah is the knower of that which is in the breasts
when man is afflicted with harm he calls to his lord allah as a witness
and if some good befalls him he is from himself and others part of the way of allah he forgets what he has created in his absence and others from his way
say o muhammad saw o you jews share with a little enjoyment
and what concern do you have regarding the fire ”
is he who is obedient to allah prostrating himself and standing in prayer during the hours of the night fearing the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord like one who disbelieves in the watches of the world to come
say are those who know equal to those who know not
but only the men of understanding heed advice
say o muhammad saw o my slaves who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism
for those who do good in this world there is good and the home of the hereafter is good
and allah is the allsufficient the provision for you
only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full without reckoning
say i am commanded to serve god making for him the religion his sincerely
and i am commanded this in order that i may be the first of those who submit themselves to allah in islam as muslims
say if i disobey my lord i fear the punishment of a grievous day
say o muhammad saw i worship allah alone by doing religious deeds sincerely for his sake only and not to showoff and not to set up rivals with him in worship
so serve what you will apart from him
say verily the losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection
above them will be a covering of fire below them a cloud of flames
that is how god gives the bondmen of his creatures need he sees
o my bondmen wherefore fear me
and those who do not worship the devil along incline towards allah and inclined towards him with peace and turn towards allah with sincere repentance
those who listen to the word and follow the best of creators
those are they whom allah has guided them
these are the people of intellect
is he then whom the word of torment justified equal to the one who avoids evil will you o muhammad saw rescue him who is in the fire
but for those who fear displeasing their lord there are lofty mansions built above mansions with rivers rippling past below them a promise of god and god does not go back on his promise
rivers flowing beneath them
it is a promise of god and god does not fail in his promise
beholdest thou not that allah sendeth down water from the heaven and then thou beholdest the earth lowly and then he causeth it to enter into the bellies therewith and thereafter springs
thereafter it wirhereth and thou beholdest it turn yellow then thou beholdest it chaff
verily in that is a sign for men of understanding
is he whose breast god has opened up to islam so that he is in light and he who has submitted himself to the same degree
woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of allah
they are in plain error
god has sent down the book containing firm koran containing the truth from him
it is allah who has sent down the remembrance the hearts of divine revelations – so their hearts are sealed – so they understand not
this is a book free from falsehood and a guidance from allah
he guides whom he wills to a straight way
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there shall be no way
and we shall not humiliate them in the state of the day of resurrection nor shall they grieve and those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah and in their messenger muhammad saw who stands firm in their testimonies
even so those before them cried lies
so the punishment came upon them from a place they did not know
so allah made them taste humiliation in the life of this world
and surely the torment of the hereafter is greater if they but know
and assuredly we have propounded for mankind in this quran every kind of similitude haply they will remember
an arabic quran wherein there is no crookedness that haply they may fear
god advances the example of a man who has struck a man in the same measure as a body and two men is equal to one
are they equal in comparison
are they equal in comparison
all the praises and thanks be to allah but most of them know not
verily you o muhammad saw will die and verily they too will die
then on the day of resurrection before your lord you will dispute
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to the truth when it comes to him
is there not in gehenna a lodging for the unbelievers
and he who brings the truth and verifies it such are the people who are godfearing
they shall have whatsoever they will desire with their lord
this is the reward of the virtuous
that god may absolve them of their sins and reward them for the best deeds they had done and reward them for what they did
is not allah sufficient for his slave
yet they try to frighten you with those whom they worship besides him
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there will be no guide
and whomsoever allah guides he will and he is the guide
is not allah allmighty the lord of retribution
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say allah
say have you considered the idols whom you call upon apart from god and what you call upon apart from god is the great guidance
or if he wills may punish me for mercy while they are with me
say god is enough for me
the trusting place their trust in him
say o muhammad saw o my people
and proclaim “ o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o my people
to whom will come a chastisement degrading him and upon whom lights a lasting chastisement
we have sent down to you the book containing the truth in order that you may be certain
and whosoever holdeth fast to allah he is of a surety guided unto a straight path
whoever goes astray does so for himself and he who strays himself only strays to its detriment
and you are not a wakil disposer of your affairs guardian etc over them
and allah grants respite to none when his appointed time death comes
then he keeps back those ordained death and sends the rest for a time ordained death and sends the rest of those who stay behind
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect
or have they taken gods apart from god
say “ what even if they do not own anything nor have they intelligence ”
say thou allahs is intercession altogether
his is the dominion of the heavens and the earth then unto him you shall be returned
and when allah alone is mentioned the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter are filled with disgust from the oneness of allah and when those who deny the hereafter they are addressed by the fire of musa moses but when it was blown away from allahs
say o god the originator of the heavens and the earth who knowest the unseen and the visible thou shalt judge between them touching that whereon they are at variance
and if the evildoers possessed all that is in the earth and the like of it again they would offer it to ransom themselves therewith of the chastisement on the day of resurrection and the chastisement
and the evils of their deeds struck them and what they used to mock at surrounded them
and when we bestow man a favour from us he says “ what has come to us ” and when we have spoken about – and we test him by a grace from him he is in the heavens and earth
then when we bestow favours on him he says “ this is a blessing from us ”
nay it is a trial but most of them know not
so said the people before them “ do not know ”
but nothing of what they did profited them
so the evil results of that which they earned overtook them
so the evil of what they have earned overtook them
they will not be able to stop in the least
do they not know that allah eases the sustenance for whomever he wills and restricts it
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
say my servants who have committed extravagance against themselves
they are lost in despair of gods mercy
he is the forgiving the merciful
turn towards your lord and submit to him before the punishment comes upon you then you will not be helped
follow the best of what has been sent down to you by your lord before the punishment comes suddenly upon you and you are unaware
he said woe to me verily i was a slave to allah ie do not rebel against his own loss in this world and in the hereafter
lest a soul should say alas i was heedless of this
or lest it should say if only god had guided me i should have been a man among the godfearing
or lest it should say when it had been my punishment
yea surely my signs came unto thee and thou beliedest them and wast stiffnecked and wast of the infidels
and on the day of resurrection you will see those who lied against allah their faces blackened
is there not an abode for the arrogant
and allah will rescue those who fear him and guide them to places of safety
neither will evil touch them nor regret
allah is the creator of all things and he is the wakil trustee disposer of affairs guardian etc over all things
and with him are the keys of the heavens and the earth
and those who disbelieve in the signs of allah those they are the losers
say o muhammad saw to the polytheists etc of allah the most beneficent allah
and it is revealed to you and to those before you if you ascribe a partner to allah you will certainly be ruined
nay but god do you serve and be among the grateful
they do not esteem god with the right estimation
and on the day of resurrection the heavens and the earth is split asunder and the heaven will be terrified of them and the dwellers of the high ground with their highest point of majesty
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
and the trumpet will be blown and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away except him whom allah will
then it shall be sounded the second time they will stand up for destruction
and the earth will shine with the light of its lord when the earth will be established and the book will be placed open and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought and the witnesses will be brought and the witnesses will not be wronged
each soul will be paid in full for what it has earned and they will not be dealt with unjustly
he knows what they do
those who disbelieve will be driven forth in the fire of hell
and when they reach it they will be driven in companies into hell they will be driven into it its gates and its gates is this not your lord has the messengers come to you
they will say yes but the word of punishment has been justified against the disbelievers
it will be said to them enter the gates of hell to abide therein
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
and those who fear their lord will be driven to paradise in throngs
when they come in it the gates is opened their hearts will be opened suddenly they will say peace be on you
peace be upon you
it will be said to them enter you the gates of hell to abide therein
they said we do not break our promise to us and to dwell in our ability that we may like and we will we will
excellent is the hire of the workers
and you will see the angels surrounding the throne of allah from all round glorifying the praises of their lord allah
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
ha meem
the revelation of the book is from allah the most honourable the all knowing
forgiver of trespasses acceptor of repentance severe in chastisement lord of power
there is no god but he unto him is the journeying
none disputes in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah but those who disbelieve
so let not their ability of going about here and there through their purposes deceive you o muhammad saw their ultimate end will be the fire of hell
before them the people of nooh denied and so did the people of nuh noah denied their noble messengers before them
so how terrible was my disapproval
thus has the word of your lord been justified against those who disbelieve that they are inmates of hell
those who bear the throne and those who are round about it proclaim the purity of their lord while praising him say “ our lord
and you have indeed done all things
so pardon them and guide them to the torment of the fire
our lord and admit them to gardens with which you have promised them and also such of their fathers spouses and their progeny and their progeny and their wives and their progeny
verily you are the allmighty the allwise
and protect them from evils
and whosoever thou shalt protect from evils on that day him thou hast surely found fear and that is a mighty achievement
those who disbelieve will be addressed by the fire of the prophet muhammad saw but allah will certainly disgrace them and allah will forgive you your sins
when you were called to faith but you disbelieved
they will say our lord twice you have given us death and twice you have given us life – twice ie now we confess our sins – so that is there any way to save us from the fire
they will say “ yes – it is the punishment and you accepted faith in allah and you used to deny the truth ”
but god is the judgement
it is he who shows you his signs and sends down sustenance from the sky for you and he revives the earth after its death
so call on god with exclusive obedience howsoever the unbelievers may dislike it
exalter of ranks is he possessor of the throne casting the spirit of the bidding of the day of resurrection that he is the greatest of the people of the day of resurrection
the day when they will come out of their graves in all haste will be of them rushing towards allah
whose then will be the kingdom gods the one the omnipotent
each soul will be recompensed for what it had earned
there will be no depriving on that day
and allah is swift in reckoning
and warn them of the day of impending calamity when hearts will rise up to the throats filled with grief and the disbelievers will have neither any fear nor regret
the sinners will have neither friend nor intercessor whose word will be heeded
he knows the deceptions of the eyes and what the hearts conceal
god decides with justice
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them
they were more powerful than them
but god seized them for their sins
there is no one to save them from god
that was because their apostles came to them with clear proofs but god destroyed them not by his leave
verily he is allstrong severe in punishment
and indeed we sent musa moses with our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and a manifest authority
firaun pharaoh haman and qarun but they said a sorcerer a liar
and when he brought them the truth from us they said slay the sons of those who believe with him and let their women live
but the unbelievers stratagem is bound to fail
and firaun pharaoh said leave me to kill musa moses and let him call his lord
i fear that he may change your religion or that he may cause corruption to appear in the land
moses said i take refuge in my lord and your lord from every insolent imposter who does not believe in the day of reckoning
and the faith of firaun who used to believe in allah and his court members which one of his people would say “ is it not that allah has fed by his faith so if you are believers ”
and assuredly there came unto you enlightenment from your lord
if he is a liar his lie will recoil back on him but in case he speaks the truth and he will tell you what he predicts will befall you
god does not guide the sinful people
“ o my people this day i will not be able to seek you in the cause of allah and to enter the garden this day you will not be able to prevail with allah except him we will surely destroy you and know the straight path ”
and the believer said “ o my people i fear for you the like of what befell you were before the day of invocation ”
like the people of nuh noah ad and thamud and those who came after them
god does not want to be unjust to his creatures and he does not want to be unjust in his place of ruin
o my people i fear for you the day of invocation
the day when you will turn your backs and flee having no power over you except god
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there will be no guide
joseph had indeed come to you with clear proofs before and after him in the distress but you did not cease to doubt what he had brought you until when you died you said
but god confirms what he had brought forth after him
thus doth allah lead the extravagant
those who wrangle concerning the signs of allah without any authority having come unto them
those who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism with him are indeed a great fulfilment
thus does allah seal up the heart of every arrogant tyrant so that they may be guided thoroughly
and firaun pharaoh said o haman build me a tower that i may arrive at the ways
the way of access to the heavens so that may be apprised of the god of musa and verily i am a liar
so i did it not this but he was a liar insolent
the pharaoh made their deeds appear good to them and they are prevented from the path
and firaun pharaoh led his plot astray but the plot of firawn was naught but in the plot of the affair
and the believer said “ o my people follow me and follow me i will guide you to the right way ”
o my people this life of the world is but a possi enjoyment and verily the hereafter that is the abode of rest
and whosoever earns evil and is a burden consequence of it
and whosoever worketh of the male or female and is a believer there shall enter paradise for him and he shall have provision in the life of this world and they shall have provision in it
and o my people why should i call you to salvation while you call me to hell
“ you disbelieve in allah and ascribe such a partner to him – when i have no knowledge of you – i do not have the knowledge of the most honourable the oft forgiving ”
you are being called to me in this world and in the hereafter and he will be among the righteous
and allah is the independent of the hypocrite
and you will remember what i will know who has been given you
i commit my affair to god
god keeps an eye on his votaries
so god guarded him against the evil chastisement of their devising and there encompassed the folk of pharaoh the evil chastisement
the day they will be exposed morning and it will be said in the morning and evening
and they will dispute in the fire the weak will say to those who were arrogant we were your followers so that you should forgive some of the fire
we shall take vengeance on you
those who were arrogant will say we are all together in this fire
verily allah has judged between his slaves
those in the fire will say to those who are in the fire “ call your lord and pray to him and believe in your lord
they will say did not your messengers bring you the clear signs
they will say yes indeed why not
they will say then do you call on your gods and the praying of unbelievers will be all the same
verily we will surely succour our apostles and those who believe in the life of this world and on the day whereon the witnesses will stand forth
the day when their excuses will be of no profit to the evildoers
for them is the curse in hell and theirs will be the evil abode
and indeed we gave moosa the guidance and we bequeathed the book to the descendants of israel its book
a guidance and an admonition unto the men of understanding
so be patient
god will not fail in his promise and god is gracious to you
and proclaim his purity morning and evening
those who wrangle concerning the signs of allah without any authority having come unto them they shall not believe in that which allah hath sent down aught wherein there is neither a guidance nor an intercessor who will surely come to them
so seek refuge in god and be thou patient surely he is allhearing and allseeing
the creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind but most men do not know
not equal are the blind and the seeing man those who believe and do deeds of righteousness and the wrongdoer
little do you reflect
verily the hour is coming there is no doubt thereof yet most men do not believe
your lord has said call upon me and i will answer your call
verily those who disdain worshipping me will enter hell disgraced
it is god who made the night for you to rest the day to make things clear for you in order that you may rest
truly allah is full of bounty to mankind yet most men thank not
that is allah your lord is the lord of everything
there is no god but he
how then are you perverted
thus were turned away those who used to deny the signs of god
it is god who made the earth a base for you and the sky a canopy – and he has made you shape and made it a canopy – and has given you shape and made you shape and has given you shape and has given you shape and
he is god your lord so worship him
blessed be god the lord of all being
he is the living one who is dead
there is no god but he
so call on god the lord of all being
say i am forbidden to worship clear signs from my lord and i am not a lord god but he
he it is who created you of dust then of a spermdrop then of a bloodclot then he delivers you as infants then that you may come out of age and you may come forth from the wombs of your mothers
some of you there are that desire this world and some of you there are to come back to us
and when the time of their appointed time are drawn up in lines for sacrifice
and it is he who gives life and causes death
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
hast thou not regarded those who dispute concerning the signs of god how they are turned about
those who denied the book and what we sent with our noble messengers so they will soon come to know
when the fetters and chains are on their necks and they dragged
into the boiling water then into the fire they will be consumed
then it will be said to them “ where are those whom you used to join in worship ”
they will say god
nay but we did not invoke any one but god
this is because you were insolent in the land without right and because you were arrogant in the land without right and because you used to behave proudly on earth
enter the gates of hell to abide therein
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
so be patient
god is the promise of the truth
whether we show you o muhammad saw part of what we promise them or we cause you to die your returning is to us and allah is allseer of what we promise you
we sent messengers before you o muhammad saw and we sent messengers to you o muhammad saw some of the messengers before you
and it was not for a messenger to bring a sign except by the leave of allah
and when the commade of allah cometh unto pass and then the command of allah cometh unto pass and then the affair will be accepted of the losers
and it is he who has created cattle for you in order that you may ride on them and of them and that you may be grateful
and there are other benefits in them for you and of them ye eat
and you have carried them in benefits for you and on them is your elegance when you bring them home and evening
and he shows you his signs so you may understand
which then of the signs and proofs of allah do you deny
have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them
they were superior to them in strength and in the traces in the land they left standing here
and there availed them not that which they had been earning
when their noble messengers came to them with clear proofs they said “ we have given them with knowledge ”
they will not be able to deal with them
then when they saw our might they said we believe in that which with him
then their faith did they not avail them when they saw our punishment
this is the law of god that has been the law of god
and the disbelievers are in the graves ie in the morning and in the sight of the disbelievers
ha meem
a book inscribed in arabic and good tidings to a people who do not believe
a book whereof the verses are detailed an arabic quran for a people who know
a bearer of glad tidings and warner and a warner and most of them were the people of man who turned away
and they say our hearts are covered against you that you should say unto us that you are under our ears and there is a deafness in our ears and in the land
and there is a deafness in our ears and a barrier between us and you
and you are acting too we are acting on our way
say thou i am only a human being like you
it is inspired in me that your ilah god is one ilah god allah
woe to the idolaters
those who do not give the obligatory charity and who do not accept faith in the hereafter
verily those who believe and do righteous works theirs shall be a hire unending
say what do you seek another one who created the earth in two days and you set up compeers to god
that is the lord of the worlds
and he placed therein firm mountains lest it should shake with them and we have placed therein firm mountains in it and he hath placed therein firm mountains lest it should be different than these people of the world to appear in it
then he turned to the heaven and it was smoke
they said we come willingly or unwillingly
then he completed and finished from their creation as seven heavens in two days and he made in each heaven its affair
we have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars
that is the measuring of the allmighty the allknowing
then if they turn away say i warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt which came upon a’ad and thamud
and when the noble messengers came to them from before them and from behind they said “ worship none but allah ” and they said “ we have heard but allah
they said we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent
as for ad they were arrogant in the land without right and they said who is stronger than us in might
did they not see that allah who created them was stronger than them in might
and they used to deny our signs
we therefore sent a violent thunderstorm towards them in order to make them taste a disgraceful punishment in the life of this world and in the hereafter
and they will not be helped
and as for thamud we showed them the way but they preferred blindness above guidance so the thunderbolt of ad overtook them and they chose the thunderbolt of the chastisement of humiliation seized them
and we rescued those who accepted faith and were pious
on the day when god will gather them together in the fire and they will be set in bands
until when they reach it their ears and their eyes and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do
and they will say to their skins why bore you witness against us
they will say “ allah has made us talk who made all things speak to us who gave it speech as he gave everything speech
he it is who created you the first time and to him you will return
you did not hide from him so that your ears and your eyes and your skins may testify against you but you did not know that god did not know the things you do
and that thought of yours which you thought about your lord has brought you to destruction and you have become an losers
then if they are a fire they will be thrown into it
but if they wish to please allah then they will not be pleased with their salutation
we have allotted them comrades and they have decked out fair to them that which is before them and behind them
and the fate of those who disbelieved before them was justified against the communities of jinns and men
they were certainly wicked
and the disbelievers said “ do not listen to this qur’an and engulf it in noise – perhaps you may be victorious this way ”
we shall surely let the unbelievers taste a terrible chastisement and we shall let them taste a terrible chastisement and the unbelievers
that is the meed of the enemies of allah the fire wherein is the abode of eternity and a recompense for that they disbelieved
and those who disbelieve will say o lord show us those of the jinn and mankind who led us astray that we may trample them underfoot and make them wholly abject
those who say our lord is god and then will strengthen your faith and follow the truth in the hereafter and it will be happy with what you were promised
rejoice at the news of paradise which you have promised
we are your friends in the life of this world and in the hereafter therein you will have whatever you call for
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and who does a better than he who says ‘ i am a muslim and says ‘ i am a muslim ’ ”
repel evil with good and evil deed with good and evil deed not equal by one who follows you in the least repel the evil with what he has earned and he is a high between you
and none attaineth that except those who are patient and none attaineth that except the owner of mighty good fortune
and if an evil whisper comes to you from shaitan satan then seek refuge with allah verily he is allhearer allknower
and of his signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon
prostrate not yourselves unto the sun nor the moon but prostrate unto allah who hath created them if him ye are wo nt to worship
and if they are too proud to do so then they too hallow him night and day and they do not grow weary of doing so they do not tire
and of his signs is that thou beholdest the earth lowly and when we send down thereon water it stirreth to life and groweth
it is he who gives water to it and brings down water on it it is he who brings it it is pure white and brings forth the rain from it
verily he who gives life to the dead
verily he is able to do all things
those who blaspheme our revelations are not hid from us
is he then who will be cast into the fire better or he who cometh secure on the day of resurrection
he is allseer of what you do
and those who disbelieve not in the book and the quran know that it is a book from allah and that it is a revelation from allah the allmighty the allwise
falsehood can not approach it nor from its back
the sending down of the book is from god the allmighty the allwise
naught is said to thee but what already was said to the messengers before thee
and your lord is the possessor of forgiveness and also the possessor of painful punishment
and had we made it a recital in a foreign tongue they would have surely said wherefore are the verses thereof not detailed
a foreign tongue and an arab audience
say the believers are only a guidance and a healing for those who believe
and as for those who disbelieve there is heaviness deafness in their ears and it is blindness for them
they are far away from a distant place
and indeed we gave moosa the book but there was disagreement about it
and had it not been for a word that went forth before from your lord the torment would have overtaken them and but for the decisive word ie been pronounced between them
they are still in doubt about it and uneasy
whosoever worketh righteously it is for his soul and whosoever worketh evil it is against it
and thine lord is not an oppressor unto his bondmen
and with him is the knowledge of the last day and there cometh not out anything of his knowledge except with him and he is not a girl “ back ”
and on the day when he will call to them and ask where are my socalled partners whom you did invent regarding this
and those they used to worship before will fail them and they will perceive that they have no place of refuge from allahs punishment
man never tires of praying for good but if evil assails him he begins to despair
and if we let him taste mercy after affliction has visited him he says surely this is mine and i wish that i was a sign of my own authority
i do not think that the hour is coming
and he saith surely the lord is with my lord in a better garden
we shall tell the unbelievers the unbelievers the things they did
and when we bless man he turns away and withdraws aside but when evil visits him he is in despair
say what think you if it is from god and you disbelieve in it who is further astray than he who is in wide schism
we shall show them our signs in the horizons and in themselves till it becomes clear to them that it is the truth
is not your lord sufficient he is a witness over all things
lo verily they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their lord
he is the encompasser of everything
ha meem
ain sin qaf
thus does allah the most honourable the all knowing sends the divine revelation to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and the men of the books before you
and to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and he is the most high the most great
wellnigh the heavens might be rent in sunder from above them
and the angels hallow the praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and those who take patrons beside him allah is warden over them
and we have sent down to you o muhammad saw the qur’an in arabic that you may warn the mother of towns ie makkah and the towns populations of towns makkah and to warn of the day of assembling of which you could not change your faith and warn
and had allah willed he would have made them one community but he causeth whomsoever he will to enter into his mercy
and the wrongdoers have neither any wali protector nor helper
or have they taken for worship auliya guardians supporters helpers protectors etc besides him
he is the patron he quickeneth the dead
and he is able to do all things
and whatever you differ therein are in anything amongst its decision rests with allah such is my lord so worship him and in him i rely
in him i have put my trust and to him i turn
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky and the earth and has made the ships to sail through it by his command and the ship sails the sea by his command and he subjected the sun and the moon
there is no other like the former nor any one
he is allhearing and allknowing
and with him are the keys of the heavens and the earth
he increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever he will and he gives provisions to whom he wills
he is the allknower of everything
he has laid his foundation upon you and that you should be on piety and be upright on the straight path
heavy is to idolaters what you invite them to
allah chooses unto himself whomsoever he will and he guideth unto himself whosoever turneth in penitence
and they divided not until after knowledge had come to them through selfish transgression between themselves
and had it not been for a word that went forth before from your lord the torment would have overtaken them and but for the decisive word ie been at rest
and those who are vouchsafed the book wish to be settled by them in a book after them
so call them to the right way and be constant as you are commanded
and you should not judge with justice with their deeds and say i believe in whatever scripture you have been sent down and i am commanded to be just with you
god is our lord and your lord
and say to us our deeds and to you your deeds
and say thou contend with you in the affair
verily allah will gather us together and also unto us our deeds
god is aware of the things they do
upon them is gods anger and upon them is a terrible chastisement
allah has sent down the book with the truth and the balance ie to act justly
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
they alone know that it is the truth being recited to them and they know that it is the truth from it and that it is certain to come
lo verily those who debate concerning the hour are in error faroff
god is gracious to his creatures and bestows favours on whosoever he will
he is allpowerful and allmighty
whoever desires the reward of this world we give him of his deeds in order to do with his deeds and whoever desires the reward of this world we give him of it
or do they have associates who has given them as religion which allah has not permitted
and had it not been for a decisive word gone forth already the matter would have been judged between them
and verily for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is a painful torment
and you will see the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers disobedient to allah and you will see the torment of the blazing fire
but those who believe and do the right are surely the gardens of paradise
they are the honoured with their lord
that is the good news that god gives to his servants who believe and do the right
say i do not ask of you a wage for this except for him who does so
verily allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah is oftforgiving mostforbearing
or do they say he has forged against god a lie
if god wills he could seal your heart and god blots out falsehood and verifies the truth by his words
and allah wipes out falsehood and establishes the truth islam by his word this quran
verily he is the allknower of the innermost secrets of the breasts
and it is he who accepts repentance from his bondmen and pardons sins and knows all your deeds
and he answers the invocation of those who believe and do righteous good deeds and gives them more out of his bounty
and for the disbelievers there is a severe torment
god has guided the angels of his creatures in the earth with his creatures in abundance and he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and he is aware of his creatures
it is he who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads out his mercy
he is allah who is the wali protector or guardian of any helper
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and his majesty established himself on the throne
and when he will he is in their assembling whensoever he will potent
whatever misfortune befalls you is a consequence of your deeds yet what your hands have earned
and he pardons much see the quran verse 3545
and you can not escape in the earth and besides allah you have neither a protector nor any supporter
and among his signs are the ships in the sea like landmarks
if he wills he can calm the winds so the ships remain still on the sea surface indeed in this are signs for every greatly enduring grateful person
or he could wreck them for what they have done yet there is much that he pardons
and know that those who dispute our signs may know that for them is a place of shelter
whatever thing you have been given is the enjoyment of the present life but what is with god is better and more enduring
and those who avoid heinous sins and indecencies and when they are wroth forgive
who are firm in devotion and pastime and standing in their lord ’s cause and whose affairs are with mutual consultation and who spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them
and those who when they take the measure from them take neither dust nor open illegal sexual intercourse
the evil of an evil deed is the like of it the evil equal to the like of it – the bad is the like of it – they are the evil ones
and whosoever pardons and repent and reform shall have the reward of his ownself and whosoever does good deeds then verily allah is oftforgiving most merciful
verily he does not like those who do wrong
and whosoever chastiseth the like of that whereby he was injured and thereafter he hath been ogain oppressed surely they shall be helped
“ except for those who oppress people and do not wish that turmoil in the earth and do not wish reform ”
these for them shall be a torment afflictive
and indeed whoever patiently endured and forgave – then indeed these are acts of great courage
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there shall be no protecting friend to take neither protector after him
and you will see the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers oppressors etc when they see the torment they will say is there any way of return to the torment
and you will see them brought forward to hell they will say in disgrace looking at it with stealthy glance
and those who believe will surely be losers in their own selves and their people will lose themselves on the day of resurrection
surely the evildoers will be in a lasting chastisement
and they will have no helpers except allah
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there shall be no way
answer the call of your lord ie accept faith in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and obey him and his messenger muhammad saw will be the first time and there will be no place of refuge on that day you will be no refuge from allah
but if they turn away we have not sent you o muhammad saw as a hafiz protector over them ie takes care of their deeds and to recompense them
we have not sent you o muhammad saw as a guardian over them
and when we cause man to taste of mercy from us he rejoices thereat but when some ill befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth then when some evil befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth lo man is ever ungrateful
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
he creates what he wills bestows daughters on whosoever he wills and bestows male offspring upon whom he wills
or he conjoineth them males and females and he maketh barren whomsoever he will verily he is of everything potent
he is allknowing and allpowerful
it is not for any human to whom god should speak to him except by suggestion or indirectly or send a messenger to convey by his command whatsoever he please he is allmighty allwise
and thus we have sent unto thee the quran as a warner
you did not know what the book was before nor the laws of faith and we made it a light whereby we guide whom we will
and verily you o muhammad saw are indeed guiding mankind to a straight path
and to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
surely all things rest with god in the end
ha meem
by the clear book
we have indeed sent it this quran down in a clear qur’an that you may understand
and verily it is in the original book with us verily the exalted full of wisdom
shall we then take away the reminder from you because you are a people who exceed the limits
how many a prophet we sent among the ancients
and never came a messenger to them but they did mock at him
we destroyed far more powerful nations than they
the example of earlier people is there
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say the allmighty the allknowing created them
who has made the earth a bed for you and has made for you roads therein in order that you may find the way
and it is he who sends down water rain from the sky and therewith revives the earth after its death
so will you be brought forth from the dead
and he who created pairs of everything and fashioned for you boats and beasts on which you ride
so glory be to him who holds all the praises of your lord and then when you have subjected the prayers that you may understand my majesty and glory be to him who has subjected the partners to him
verily to our lord we are to return
and he said to his slaves by his grace a part of the knowledge that he may reveal by his own authority to any part of the belief and he knows that you describe
man is dearly unthankful
or has he taken daughters out of what he has created and he has selected for you sons
and when there is announced unto any of them a female his countenance remainoth darkened the whole day and he is wroth inwardly
did they think who grow in adornments wearing silk and gold ornaments ie women and gold complete their rights and gold not even though they were in the scale of the tree thereof
and they make the angels who are themselves servants of the allmerciful females
did they witness their creation
their witness shall be written down and they shall be questioned
and they say had the compassionate willed we would not have worshipped them false
they have no knowledge of it they do not know of it
they only make up lies
or have we given them a book before this to him they are in the doubt
nay but they say we found our fathers following a certain way and religion and we are following their footsteps
and we sent not before thee any township before thee except that we revealed to some of the people of the towns and their traces that they say we found our fathers following a certain way
he said what even if i bring you a better guidance than what you found your fathers following
they said we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent
so we took vengeance on them
so behold what wise hath been the end of those who were warned
and when abraham said to his father and his people i am innocent of what you worship
he said i am not going to worship him who created me and i will guide me
he made it a word enduring among his posterity haply so they will return
nay but i gave them and their fathers enjoyment until the truth came to them
and when the truth had come to them from before us they said why has he not been given the like of that which was given to musa moses
and they said “ why was this not a great man sent down to some man of moment two towns ”
is it they who would portion out the mercy of your lord
it is we who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and settled some of them over others in a case that they may take one another
the favours of your lord is better than what they amass
and were it not that mankind would have become one community of belief in the most beneficent allah so that they might become violent filled with prostrating and we would have made them as a number of days of silver whereby they will not be able to take revenge
and silver doors for their houses and silver couches whereon they recline
and ornament of gold
and diverse adornments and all this is usage only of the life of this world and the hereafter with your lord is for the pious
and whosoever blindeth himself to the admonition of the allmerciful we assign unto him a satan and we assign him a satan unto him
and verily they hinder them from the way whilst they deem that they are rightly guided
until when he comes to us he will say to the east and the west between us and you were insolent
how evil a destination
it will be said to them “ this day you are lost in pursuit of the disbelievers ”
it is the sin of disbelief in this world you will not be able to do it
can you make the deaf to hear or show the blind and the deaf to the truth or you can not see the truth or him who is in open error
we shall take you away if we will wreak vengeance upon them
or show you what we have promised them
we shall certainly wreak vengeance upon them
so hold you o muhammad saw fast to that which is inspired in you
you are indeed on the straight path
and verily it is an admonition unto thee and thy people
ask then we never sent before you any other gods except men whom we inspired
and indeed we sent musa moses with our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and his dignitaries he said “ i am a messenger from the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
but when he brought them our signs lo they laughed at them
and not a sign we showed them but it was greater than the other that they might return
they said “ o sorcerer pray to your lord for us by a covenant he has given you
but when we removed from them the chastisement behold they broke their troth
and firaun pharaoh said o my people is not mine the dominion of egypt and these rivers flowing underneath me
am i not better than this one who is contemptible and can not even express himself clearly
if the angels had peopled the earth and walked in peace and quiet and the provision thereof and they would surely have been able to give it
thus he made light of the matter to his people and they obeyed him
verily they were a people who were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
so when they took revenge on them we drowned them all together
and we made them a precedent and an ensample unto those after
and when the son of mary is cited as an example behold when the example of the seed behold they turn away from their own people thereupon they begin to bear their burden
and they say are our gods better or is he
nay but they are a people who behave senselessly
he iesa jesus was not more than a slave man we granted our favour to him and we made him an example for the children of israel
and if we willed we could have appointed angels born of you in the earth angels walking around their place
he iesa jesus son of maryam mary was a messenger of allah
so do not follow him this is the straight path
let not satan misdirect you
verily he is unto you an open enemy
when jesus came with the clear signs he said i have come to you with wisdom and to explain some of that in which you differ
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
that is the straight path
but the factions differed among themselves
woe then unto those who do wrong by ascribing things to iesa jesus that are not true from the torment of a painful day ie the day of resurrection
await they just for the hour that it should come upon them on a sudden while they perceive not
friends on that day shall be foes to one another but the godfearing
o my servants today no fear is on you neither do you sorrow
those who believed in our signs and were submissive
enter paradise you and your wives walking with joy
there will be passed around them platters of gold and cups
there will be therein all that the eyes delight in which are present and the eyes will be all kinds of great violence
therein you shall have all that you choose
this is the paradise you have been given for an inheritance for what you did
and therein you shall have fruits in plenty of which you shall eat as you have fruits of all kinds
the sinners will certainly dwell for ever in the torment of hell
it will not decrease for them dumb with despair they will stay in it
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
and they will cry o malik keeper of hell let your lord make an end of us
we have brought you the truth but most of you do not understand
or have they plotted some plan
or do they think we hear not their secrets and whispers yea we hear not their secrets
in fact with them are our noble messengers
say if arrahman had a son i would have taken a son act as a son i would be the first to worship of him
hallowed be the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the throne from that which they ascribe
so leave them alone to plunge and play until they encounter that day of theirs which they are promised
he is god in heaven and god on earth
he is the wise the knower
blessed be he who holds the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them he wills and the issue in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and he is the allmighty the allwise
then to him you shall be returned
and those who call upon apart from him have no power of intercession save those who have borne witness to the truth and who know that they only justify the truth
and wert thou to ask them who created them they will surely say allah
how then are they deviating
“ my lord is the best people who do not believe ”
turn away from them and say peace
again no one but must come to know
ha meem
by the clear book
we have sent it down in a blessed night
therein is decreed every affair of wisdom
as a command from us – we do not send the messengers
a mercy from your lord
he is allhearing and allknowing
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you have faith
there is no god but he
he gives life and causes death
he quickeneth and causeth to die your lord and the lord of your forefathers
nay but they play in doubt
so watch for the day when the sky begins to emit clear smoke
covering the people this is a painful chastisement
that is a grievous affliction
our lord remove from us the torment verily we shall become believers
how can there be for them an admonition when an apostle came to them
but they turned away from him and said a man tutored possessed
we shall remove the torment a little while then you will revert
on the day when we shall seize them with a great grip
and assuredly we tried before them firauns pharaoh party of the people of firawn when there came unto them a messenger
“ and come to me ”
i am for you a faithful messenger
and exalt not yourselves against allah and exalt not yourselves
and i have come to you with a clear authority
and i take refuge in my lord and your lord and your lord lest you should stone me
but if you believe me not go you apart from me
then he called to his lord these are a people guilty
said he depart you with my servants by night
you will be pursued
and leave the sea as it comes forth
verily they are a host to be drowned
and gardens and springs
and green crops fields etc and goodly places
and favours amongst which they were rejoicing
even so and we caused to inherit them another people
and the heavens and the earth wept not over them nor were they respited
and indeed we saved the children of israel from a humiliating torment
pharaoh said and council pronounce
he was certainly a tyrant guilty of excess
and assuredly we tried sulaiman and set a mere body thereafter he repented therewith
and we gave them signs in which lay clear favours
these people do not understand
there is nothing but our first death and we shall not be resurrected
bring back our forefathers if you speak truly
are they better or the people of tubba and those before them
and ad and thamud people
verily they are to be drowned
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for mere play
we created them not save with truth but most of them know not
verily the day of decision is their appointed time for all of them
the day when maulan a near relative can not avail maulan a near relative in aught and no partners in the least
and he is not able to help them
except for allah is the true believer of islamic monotheism who has been granted to his mercy
he is the allmighty the most merciful
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
is the food of the guilty
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
lay hold of him and chain him
then pour over his head the torment of boiling water
taste
you were indeed the mighty and noble
this is certainly what you had denied
surely the godfearing shall be in a station secure
in gardens and watersprings
dressed in fine silk and also in thick silk facing each other
even so and we shall espouse them to wideeyed houris
therein calling for every fruit secure
they will not taste death therein except the first death and he will preserve them from the torment of the blazing fire
a reward from your lord an ample calculated gift according to the best of their good deeds
that is the supreme achievement
and we have made this quran easy in your tongue o muhammad saw in order that they may remember
so wait they too are waiting
ha meem
the revelation of this book is from allah the most honourable the wise
verily in the heavens and the earth are signs for believers
and in the creation of the crawling things he scatters abroad there are signs for a people having sure faith
and in the alternation of night and day and in the alternation of night and day and in the sustenance from the sky and the earth after its death indeed in this are signs for people who understand
these are the verses of allah we recite to you in truth
in what discourse then will they believe except
woe to every sinful liar
who hears the verses of allah being recited to him then persists with pride as if he heard them not
so announce to him a painful torment
and when he learns something of our verses this quran he makes them a jest
for such there will be a humiliating torment in the hellfire
behind them is hell and what they have earned will not avail them in the least against allah
for them there is a great torment
this is the guidance
and those who disbelieve in the signs of their lord theirs shall be a torment afflictive
it is god who made the earth subservient to you that you may show the way
so that you may be grateful
and he has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and he hath subjected for you his grace and he hath appointed for you the day of resurrection and hath subjected for you a provision from him
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect
say thou unto those who believe let them forgive those who hope not for the days of allah that he may requite those who fear
god will not take account of every people for their unbelief
whosoever worketh righteously it is for his soul and whosoever worketh evil it is only to his own loss
then to your lord you will be made to return
and indeed we gave the children of israel the book and the rule and the prophethood and gave them superiority over others of their time
and we gave them clear signs and proofs in matters of their affairs
and they divided not until after knowledge had come to them through selfish transgression between themselves
verily your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
thereafter we have set thee upon the law of the religion a community binding upon him in the matter of religion
so follow it and follow the path of those who are ignorant
verily they can not avail thee at all at all at night except allah
verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc are auliya protectors helpers etc one of another but allah is the wali helper of kin
this is a clear declaration from their ears and having come to them and a guidance and a mercy for people who believe
deem those who commit ill deeds that we shall make them equal in life and death their abode is hell and what an evil destination
allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth and that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned and they shall not be wronged
beholdest thou him who taketh for him his god and god has sent him astray despite his having sealed his ears and his heart and has set a seal upon his heart and his hearing and his sight and his heart and upon their eyes swerved aside a covering
who is he besides allah
and who gives his salat prayer at the daybreak
will you not then contemplate
and they say there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and nothing destroys us except addahr the time
they have no knowledge of it they only follow conjecture
they have no knowledge of it they do not know of it
and when our clear verses are recited to them their clear signs are recited to them they say bring back our forefathers if you are truthful
say god gives you life then makes you die
he will raise you to life then cause you to die then he will gather you together on the day of resurrection in which there is no doubt but most men do not know
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
and on the day when the hour will be established on that day the followers of falsehood polytheists disbelievers worshippers of false deities etc are lost in destruction
and thou shalt see every nation hobbling on their knees
every community advanced toward its community
and be ye today for that which ye have been vouchsafed
this our record speaks about you with truth
he is your open enemy
verily we were recording what you used to do ie our angels used to record your deeds
but as for those who believe and do deeds of righteousness their lord will admit them to his mercy
that is the evident success
but as for those who disbelieve it will be said to them “ did not your meeting with you but you were a people who were mujrimun polytheists disbelievers sinners criminals ”
and when it is said to them “ indeed allah is the truth and we are not going to destroy the disbelievers ”
and the evils of their deeds appeared to them and they used to mock at surrounded them
and it will be said today we shall forget you even as ye forgot the encounter of this your day and your followers will be forgotten the meeting of this day
and besides allah you have neither any wali protector or guardian nor any helper
that is because you took the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah and the worldly life deceived you
so they will not be allowed to be removed from the fire nor will they be suffered to make amends
all praise is to allah lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the creation of the heavens and the lord of the earth lord of all the worlds
and he is the only creator in the heavens and the earth
and he is the allmighty the allwise
ha meem
the revelation of this book is from allah the most honourable the wise
and we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth and for an appointed term
yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning
say o muhammad saw to these polytheists pagans etc
or have they7 any partnership in the heavens
or some a book before this or some trace of knowledges if ye say sooth
who is more astray than one who calls apart from god on the day of resurrection and who can not answer them
and when mankind are gathered on the day of resurrection they will become their enemies and will become their worshippers
and when our signs came to them with the truth they said “ this is a clear magic ”
or do they say he has forged it
say if i have fabricated it still you have no power to save me from god
he knows best what you say is in the heavens
he is the most merciful the forgiving
say i am not the first messenger to them
and i am not a guardian over you
i only follow what is revealed to me and i am only a clear warner
say thou bethink ye if it is from allah and a witness that ye disbelieve therein while ye disbelieve therein while ye are disbelievers
verily allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and those who disbelieve say if it had been aught in it they would not have preceded us thereto
and before this was the book of musa moses as a guide and a mercy and a mercy
and this is a book confirming it in which the wrongdoers have been sent down before and glad tidings to the muhsinun gooddoers see v 2112
surely those who say our lord is god and then go straight with their caprices nothing to no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
they are the people of paradise abiding in it forever the reward of their deeds
we have charged man that he be kind to his parents his mother bore him painfully and painfully she gave birth to him his bearing and his weaning are thirty months
thirty months is the period of her carrying and weaning him
and when he attains to manhood and the age of forty he says o lord dispose me that i may be grateful for your favours over you and my parents and that i may do righteousness and that i may do righteousness and that i may be grateful to
verily i am one of the muslims who submit to allah in islam
i turn to you in penitence and submit
they are those from whom we accept the best of what they have done and overlook their evil deeds
and when he said to his father and his people will say to you “ uff – i am fed i will give you what you like ”
and the promise of allah is true and the most gracious who says “ will you be raised up after me ”
naught is this but fables of the ancients
they are those upon whom the sentence of punishment has been justified among the previous generations of jinns and men
they are the losers
for all there will be degrees in accordance with that which he hath wrought and they will not be wronged
on the day when those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism are exposed to the fire it will be said to them your good deeds in the life of the world and enjoyed them your good deeds in the life of the world and enjoyed them
and remember ad when he warned his people in alahqaf the curved sandhills in the southern part of arabian peninsula
i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
they said have you come to turn us away from our gods
then bring us that thou promisest us if indeed thou speakest truly
he said only god has the knowledge
he said “ i preach unto you what i have been sent with and i see you are a foolish people ”
then when they saw it as a sudden cloud coming towards their valleys they said this is a cloud bringing us rain
nay it is what you wish to hasten is in the torment
and we did it not befit the angels to send down except in the command of his lord – and it is nothing but a single soul
thus do we requite the people who are mujrimun disbelievers polytheists sinners criminals etc
and if he be of the fellows on the right hand
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him shall we be given you as a herald of warning
and if he be of the beliers the erring
then his reception is the hot boiling water
and roasting in a blaze
this is indeed an utmost certainty
so glorify the name of your lord the great
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
and he is the allmighty the allwise
his is the dominion of the heavens and the earth
he gives life and causes death and he is able to do all things
he is the first and he the last the transcendent and the immanent and he has knowledge of everything
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days then seated himself upon the throne
he knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it what comes down from the heaven and what ascends thereto
he is with you wherever you may be and he is with you wherever you may be
and allah is allseer of what you do
his is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and unto allah shall be the return of all affairs
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and he knows what is in the hearts of men
believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and spend of that whereof he has made you trustees
and those of you who believe and expend theirs shall be a great hire
why do you believe in your lord whereas the messenger calls you to that you believe in your lord
it is he who sends down clear signs to his servant that he may bring you forth from darkness into light
god is merciful to you
what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of allah whereas allah is the inheritor of all that is in the heavens and in the earth
those of you who spent and fought before the conquest of mecca are not equal to those who did not even your lord
they are higher in position than those who spent after the victory and fought
and allah hath promised the twain
and allah is allaware of what you do
who is he that will lend god a good loan and he will multiply it for him manifold
on the day when you will see the believing men and believing women their light running forward before them and their light they will be set free of a dreadful push
this day we shall give you gardens under which rivers flow paradise underneath which rivers flow that is because of their disbelief
therein you shall have all that you choose
that is the supreme achievement
on the day when the hypocrites men and women will say to those who believe wait for us and we shall tell you what we say to the believers may borrow your light
it will be said go back to them at the place where are you now to be raised
a wall will be raised between them and a wall with which is in which there will be a door in the inward whereof there is mercy
they will call to them did we not not fight you
they will say yes indeed but you tempted yourselves and you awaited and you were in doubt and fancies deluded you until gods promise came and the deluder deluded you concerning god
so this day no ransom shall be accepted of you nor of those who disbelieved
the fire is your destination
he is your friend
and what a wretched place to return
did not the time come when the hearts had come to them in the hearts of those who believe not when they have been given the book and the law of god and the torah and the gospel were not given to them that he should not send down
know that allah quickeneth earth after the death thereof
we have distinguished you so that you may understand
those who believe and spend in allah ’s noble messenger and bestow upon them a great reward
and those who believe and his apostles and those are with their lord and those who have been true of their promise they are the losers
they have their guerdon and their light
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our revelations — these are the inmates of hell
know that the life of this world is but play and a pastime and an adornment and a selfglorification among you and vying in respect of riches and children
the likeness of a deep into the heaven and the plants of the trees with clustered grain
it is a calamity that befalls you gradually it is still waiting for you but you see the rain falls into dry than you slowly in a way
thereafter there is forgiveness and a great torment
the life of this world is but a merchandise of vanity
race towards forgiveness from your lord and towards paradise and towards paradise with a expanse
this is the kingdom of the coming of the blessed place of god he gives whosoever he please
and allah is the owner of great bounty
there is no calamity that befalls on the earth or your own selves but is in accordance with the law of causation before we make it evident
verily that is easy for allah
and that you may not grieve for what you have escaped you or for what you like
verily allah likes not each arrogant boaster
those who are misers and enjoin upon people miserliness allah is not in need of their charity
and whosoever turneth away then verily allah he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
we have indeed sent our noble messengers with clear signs and with them that they should make peace with all things clear evidence and that you may be witnesses
and we sent down iron wherein is great violence and allah will give mankind a greater host to help them or a host of help from allah and his messenger saw and allah will not help you all
verily allah is allstrong allmighty
and indeed we sent nooh and the book and the prophethood and the book and the book and the wisdom and we sent it as a herald of warning
and many of them are transgressors
thereafter we sent our apostles successively
so we gave him the right of the importance of his right and we made his commandments and to him and to be dutiful and kind
we wished to please them but we did not believe in them except the steadfast in fact they inclined towards allah
so we gave those who believed their reward in full and made the believers a repay them in his way
and most of them are transgressors
and fear allah and believe in his noble messenger and he will give you a double portion of his mercy and he will appoint for you a light whereby you will walk straight and forgive you
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
that he may know that the people of the scripture jews and christians may know that they have no power over anything of his bounty and that god is powerful over everything
and allah is the owner of great bounty
god has heard what is about her that disputes with thee concerning her husband and makes complaint unto god
and allah hears the argument between you both
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
those among you who have proclaimed their wives as their mothers do not swear by their mothers their mothers their mothers are only those who gave them birth and undoubtedly they are a people who have been given birth
they utter an evil lie and indeed they have uttered an evil thing
and allah is pardoning forgiving
and those who make their wives unlawful azzihar and then retract what they have said “ if they have gone away from their wives have gone away from them ”
this is a message to you
and allah is allaware of what you do
and whosoever findeth not a slave to free on him is the fasting for two months in succession before he who is in two months and on him who is not in two months before he touch each other
that is in order that you may believe in god and his messenger
these are the limits set by allah so they commit illegal sexual intercourse and for the disbelievers there is a painful torment
verily those who oppose allah and his apostle will be abased even as those before them were abased and of a surety
we have sent down clear signs and for the unbelievers awaits a humbling chastisement
on the day when allah will raise them all together and inform them of what they did
god takes account of it although they forget it
and allah is witness over all things
hast thou not seen how that god knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
did you not perceive that all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth or in their task for them except a few of them and they do not know that allah is with them and only he is with them and in the heavens
then on the day of resurrection he will announce their deeds to them what they used to do
and allah is the allknower of everything
observest thou not those who whisper one another whispering secretly and they whisper one another
when they come to you o muhammad saw they greet you with a greeting even then allah does not greet you with any good or else and in any way
hell will be sufficient for them they will burn therein
and what a wretched place to return
o you who believe do not consult each other in the least sin and disobedience to the noble messenger and consult each other in the conduct ie in the oneness of allah and in the noble messenger muhammad saw
and fear allah unto whom ye shall be gathered
whisper is only from the unseen and he in order that he may grieve those who believe and he can not harm them in the least
and in allah let believers put their trust
o you who believe when you are told to make room in the assemblies then make room god will give you more room to spread
and when it is said rise up then rise up allah will exalt those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge in degrees
and allah is allaware of what you do
o you who believe when you want to consult the noble messenger offer charity before your private consultation with them
that is better and purer for you
and if you find not the means then verily allah is oftforgiving most merciful
are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation with him
and allah is ever pardoning forgiving
and allah is allaware of what you do
hast thou not seen those who have taken for friends a people upon whom is the wrath of god
they are neither of you nor of them
they swear by god
god has prepared for them a terrible chastisement
evil indeed is that which they have been performing
they have made their oaths a shield and obstruct people from the way of god
they will have a shameful punishment
and the favour of allah that they should not profit them
they are the people of hell where they will abide for ever
on the day when allah will raise them all together they will swear in front of them and they will swear in front of them indeed they will swear in their state
lo verily they they are the liars
satan has gained the mastery over them and caused them to forget gods remembrance
they are the band of the satan
lo verily it is the satans band that shall be the losers
those who oppose allah and his messenger muhammad saw they are the most honourable the most merciful
allah has decreed verily it is i who shall overcome and my messengers
verily allah is allstrong allmighty
you will not find a people who believe in god and the last day loving those who oppose god and his messenger even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kin
he has written faith in their hearts and has written faith with them he will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow in paradise to abide therein forever
they will abide in it for ever
god will admit them to gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
they are the people of the fire
lo verily allah is the hearing the sight of allah that will not be successful
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god he is the allmighty the allwise
it is he who expelled from their habitations the unbelievers among the people of the book at the first mustering
and they thought that their fortresses would defend them against allah
but god came upon them from where they expected not put their hearts to their own hands and their own hands and their dwellings
o you tranquil soul
and had allah not decreed exile for them he would have punished them in this world and in the hereafter
for them is the torment in the hereafter
this is because they opposed allah and his noble messenger and whoever opposes allah then indeed allah ’s punishment is severe
whatever palmtrees you cut down or left standing on their roots was by gods leave and he seized the sinners
and whatever spoils of war god has sent against you of war against them and his messenger and to take out of them and you will not be able to take away their own selves and god is with those who are godfearing
and allah is able to do all things
whatever booty god gave to his messenger from the people of the townships and his messenger and to the relatives and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarers and the people of the rich because allah and his messenger and to give the alms and the messenger and
and whatsoever the apostle giveth you take and whatsoever he forbiddeth you refrain from
and fear allah verily allah is severe in punishment
and those who have emigrated and were expelled from their habitations and their possessions and their suffering anxious are not to be straitened for them and god is allmighty allwise
they are the people of the right hand
those who were left behind the people of the book before them who refused to believe and were expelled from their habitations and they will not find any way to them
and whosoever is saved from his own covetousness such are they who will be the successful
and those who came after them say our lord forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in our hearts thou and place not in our hearts any rancour toward those who believe and thou art the compassionate
hast thou not regarded those who disbelieve in their friends a hypocrites who disbelieve in their friends with their jews and their enmity and if they are expelled we shall not go forth with you and we will not go forth in any way
and allah beareth witness that surely they are liars
surely they are expelled from among the people of the book and even if they are fought against they will not help them and even if they helped them they will not turn their backs and flee and then they will not be helped
and fear allah
that is because they are a people who understand not
they will not fight you except in fortified townships or from behind walls
their enmity among themselves is very great
you think they are united but their hearts are divided
that is because they are a people who understand not
like those who were before them who tasted the mischief of their action there awaits them a painful chastisement
and when the devil reaches man he said “ i have indeed rejected you as a human being ” and i am innocent of what you do not have any relation with your deeds
and when man disbelieves in the signs of his lord of the worlds
both of them will be in the fire abiding therein forever
that is the recompense of the evildoers
o you who believe fear allah and let every soul consider what it has sent ahead and what it has sent ahead and allah is aware of your deeds
and be not like those who forgot allah so he caused them to forget their own souls
those they are the transgressors
not equal are the dwellers of the fire and the dwellers of the paradise
the dwellers of paradise will be the dwellers of paradise they will abide in it forever
and had we sent down this quran upon a mountain thou wouldst surely have seen it humbling itself and cleaving in sunder for fear of allah
and these similtudes we propound them for mankind and that they may reflect
he is god there is no god but he the knower of the unknown and the known the mighty and the wise
this is the true narrative about the story of iesa jesus and la ilaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah and he is the wakil trustee disposer of affairs guardian etc
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
who created the heavens and the earth and the measure and god is guardian over all things
to him belong the attributes most beautiful
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth halloweth allah
and he is the allmighty the allwise
o you who believe do not take my enemies and your enemies as friends
they are those who have disbelieved in the oneness of allah and in his messenger muhammad saw and in his messenger muhammad saw and in order to make you superior to them
if you have come out to struggle in my cause having sought my acceptance do not be friendly with them in secret
and i know what you conceal and what you reveal
if they gain dominance over you they will be your enemies and will extend their hands and their tongues towards you with evil and they wish that you should disbelieve
and on the day of resurrection you shall not profit you
he will judge between you
and allah is allseer of what you do
and in abraham and those who argued with him with ibrahim and those who said “ we are indeed an excellent noble messenger from you and we are indeed your people before you and you and we are not in need of allah ”
our lord make us not a temptation to those who disbelieve
and you are the allmighty the allwise
assuredly there hath been in them an excellent patternfor him who hopeth for allah and the last day
and whosoever turneth away then verily allah he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
belike allah may make an enemy between you and those of them whom ye hold as enemies affection
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
god does not forbid you from those who did not deal with those who did not fight against you in religions cause nor expelled you from your habitations that you should be kindly to them
verily allah loves those who are equitable
god only forbids you as regards those who fought against you in religions cause and expelled you from your habitations and supported in your expulsion that you should take them for friends
and whosoever takes them for friends those they are the evildoers
o believers when believing women come to you as emigrants test them
god is aware of their faith
and if you find them back they have faith and do not send them back to unbelievers
and give them what they have expended and there is no fault in them that they may be the wedded believing women
there is no sin on you if you marry them as disbelievers
hold fast to the ties of the disbelievers and ask what they have expended
this is the judgement of god
he judges between you
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and if any of your wives slips away from you to the unbelievers and you retaliate only in the one whose hand is acceptable to them
and fear allah in whom you believe
o prophet when believing men and believing women come to you with their baia pledge that they will not associate anything in worship with allah nor steal nor commit adultery nor kill their children nor kill their children nor commit illegal sexual relation with them they will utter slander
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe do not befriend disbelievers in preference over them they are the disbelievers
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
and he is the allmighty the allwise
o you who believe why do you profess what you do not practise
most hateful is with allah that you say that which you do not do
verily allah loveth those who fight in his way drown up in ranks as though they were a structure well compacted
and recall what time musa said unto his people o my people wherefore hurt ye me when surely ye know that verily i am unto you an apostle from allah
but god is witness to you
verily they are a people who are fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
and recall what time isa son of maryam said o children of israil verily i am allahs apostle unto you confirming the taurat which came before me and the injil of allah is a warner and unto the children of israil that shall be brought unto you confirming that
but when their messengers came to them with clear proofs they said this is nothing but pure magic
and who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against allah while he is being invited to islam
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
they want to extinguish with their mouths but god refuses but to complete his light though the unbelievers be averse
it is he who has sent his noble messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to prevail over all other religions – even though the idolaters dislike it
o you who believe shall i direct you to a commerce that will deliver you from a painful torment
strive in the cause of allah and his noble messenger and wealth and soul will be given wealth and soul
that is better for you if you only knew
he will forgive you your sins and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow – in paradise
that is the supreme achievement
and also in your own hands and in that which ye love succour from allah and a speedy victory
and give glad tidings o muhammad saw to the believers
“ o eisa the son of maryam – when allah will help me in the books and the disciples who will help me inclining towards allah ’ ”
and a party of the children of israel believed and a party disbelieved
so we confirmed those who believed against their enemy and they became masters
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god the king the allholy the allmighty the allwise
it is he who has sent down to them a noble messenger from among themselves and recites to them his verses and purifies them and teaches them the book and wisdom and the wisdom and the wisdom and the wisdom and the taurat torah and the injeel gospel in
and others of them who have not joined them yet
and he is the allmighty the allwise
this is the kingdom of the coming of the blessed place of god he gives whosoever he please
and allah is the owner of great bounty
the likeness of those who were laden with the taurat and then they bare it not is as the likeness of the ass bearing tomes
how bad is the example or the likeness of people who deny the ayat proofs evidences verses signs revelations etc of allah
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
say thou o ye e who are judaised if ye imagine at ye are the friends of allah above mankind then wish for death if ye say sooth
but they will never long for it death because of what their hands have sent ahead and they will not wish
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
say surely the death from which you flee will surely meet you
and you will be brought back to him who knows the unseen and the visible and he will tell you what you did
then he will inform you of what you were doing
o you who believe when the call for prayer is made on friday the day of congregation rush towards the remembrance of allah and stop buying and selling this is the promise that must be taken by allah and call for allah and be rescued by making your invocations
that is better for you if you only knew
and when the prayer is finished scatter in the land and seek gods bounty and remember god frequently haply you will prosper
and when they see some merchandise or some amusement beating of tambur drum etc they disperse headlong to it and leave you muhammad saw standing while delivering jumuahs religious talk khutbah
say what is with god is better than diversion and merchandise
and allah is the best of providers
when the hypocrites come to you they say we bear witness that you o muhammad saw are indeed liars
god knows that you are indeed his messenger and god bears witness that the hypocrites are liars
and allah beareth witness that surely they are liars
they have made their oaths a shield in order to obstruct others from the way of god
verily vile is that which they have been working
that is because they disbelieved in allah and in his messenger muhammad saw
and when you look at them their bodies please you and when they speak you listen to their words
they are like though they were asses startled
they think every cry is against them
they are the enemy so beware of them
so do not fear them
may allah confound them whither are they turning away
and when it is said to them come now to the noble messenger allah will ask forgiveness for you they turn away their heads and you will see them turning away their faces in pride
it is equal to them whether you muhammad saw ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them allah will not forgive them
verily allah guides not the people who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
they are the ones who say do not spend on those who are with the apostle of god until they break away from him
to god belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
they will say if you are driven back we shall surely go to hell and will surely go back to the city surely we shall be the greatest if you are driven back
but the hypocrites know that god is the allmighty the allwise
o you who believe let not your wealth and children make you negligent of the remembrance of allah
and whosoever doth that then those they are the losers
spend of that with which we have provided you before death comes to one of you and he says o my lord i had given you a little while then i would have given you a better deal
and allah deferreth not a soul when its term hath come and allah is aware of that which ye do
and allah is allaware of what you do
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
his is the dominion and his is the praise and he is over everything potent
it is he who created you in the wombs one of you is an unbeliever
and allah is allseer of what you do
he created the heavens and the earth with deliberation and gave you form and shaped you well and to him is your returning
to him is the return of all
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and he knows what you hide and what you disclose
and allah is the allknower of what is in the breasts of men
did not the news of those who disbelieved before you reach you
so they tasted the evil result of its disbelief and theirs will be a painful torment
this was because their apostles came to them with clear proofs but they said what shall we disbelieve in the message and muhammad saw
verily those who disbelieve and die while they are infidels
so they disbelieved and turned away and allah needed them not
the unbelievers claim that they will not be raised again
say yes by my lord you will be raised again and then you will be told of what you did
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
therefore believe in allah and his noble messenger and in the light which we have sent down
and allah is allaware of what you do
on the day when he will gather you together and all together
that day the believers will be overwhelmed with despair
and whosoever believeth in allah and worketh righteously him he will cause to enter gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders therein for evermore
they will abide in it for ever
that is the supreme achievement
but as for those who disbelieve and reject our revelations — these are the inmates of hell where they will abide for ever
and what a wretched place to return
no calamity befalls unless god dispenses
whoever believes in god he will guide his heart
and allah is the allknower of everything
say obey god and obey the messenger
if you turn away remember that the duty of our apostle is to give you a clear warning
allah la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he and in allah let the believers put their trust
o you who believe among your wives and children there are surely enemies to you so beware of them
and if the enemy beware of them and your wives are your enemy so fear god and do not let them forgive you
your wealth and your children are only a trial whereas allah wills
and allah is the best reward to him and he is the best reward
so fear god as much as you can and listen and obey and spend in charity for your own good
and whosoever is saved from his own covetousness such are they who will be the successful
if you lend an excellent loan to allah he will multiply it for you and will forgive you
and allah is oftforgiving mostforbearing
the all knowing of every hidden and the visible the most honourable the wise
o prophet when you divorce women divorce them when they have reached their period and calculate that period and fear god your lord
do not expel them from their houses nor should they go away except in a clear way
these are the bonds of allah then allah shall make them wrong and whosoever trespasseth the bonds of allah then verily allah hath wronged himself
you can not know that god will bring something new to pass
and when they have reached their term either retain them reputably or let them witness their wealth and children as a witness between you and them both of you and that allah may test your witness that he may reward them according to what he wills
and the recompense for allah believes in the last day and the latter
and whosoever feareth allah he maketh for him an outlet
and he provideth for him from whence he reckoneth not upon
and whosoever puts his trust in allah then he will suffice him
god attains his purpose and god has appointed to everything a measure
and as for those of your women who have gone forth from their husbands have no hope of menstruation and in case you have doubt as they have in their mothers as regards respect and fear allah and his slave is three months as also they have also in
and as for those who are pregnant their prescribed period is until they deliver their burthen
and whosoever feareth allah he maketh his affair unto him easy
that is allah he has sent down to you the salvation that he has sent down unto you
and whosoever feareth allah he will expiate his misdeeds from him and will make for him a hire
lodge them wheresoever ye lodge yourselves according to your means and hurt them not so as to straiten them
and do not favour others on them
and if they are pregnant then spend on them until they give birth to them
and when you have divorced women and they speak in wedlock not that you should deal with them fairly
let the man of means expend according to his means and whosoever is stinted in his subsistence let him expend of that which he hath given him
allah does not burden anyone except with his body
god will assuredly appoint after difficulty easiness
how many a town defied the command of its lord and his messengers and rebelled against the command of its lord
we could not take care of him
so they tasted the evil result of its disbelief and the consequence of its disbelief was loss destruction in this life and an eternal punishment in the hereafter
god has prepared for them a terrible chastisement
so fear allah o men of understanding
god has sent down to you a reminder and an advice to the mindful penitent
verily those who believe and do righteous works unto the darknesses into the light and the light of the light of allah they cause
and whosoever believeth in allah and worketh righteously him he will cause to enter gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders therein for evermore
verily allah has provision for him
allah it is who hath created seven heavens and of them seven heavens and of them
god is aware of the things you do
o prophet why makest thou unlawful that which allah hath made lawful unto thee seeking the goodwill of thy wives
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
god has ordained for you the absolution of your oaths
god is your master an excellent protector
he is the wise the knower
and remember when the prophet saw disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives hafsah so that he may say to another ie muhammad saw who is a human being whom he wills and he is a witness from among his believing slave
then when he had apprised her of it she said who hath acquainted thee therewith
he said the allknower the allaware allah has told me
if you both turn to god and his messenger and you will find your hearts for then surely god is aware of the things you do
and if you obey the prophet saw then you will be your friends but if you help one another against another then allah is the wali protector etc of the believers
if he divorces you his lord will give him better than you in return penitent devout penitent devout penitent worshippers given to fasting both nonvirgins and virgins
o people who believe
make no excuses today
you are being requited only for what you had done
o you who believe turn to your faces and your lord will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow and will say to them your lord will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow in paradise
o prophet muhammad saw
their abode is hell
and what a wretched place to return
god advances the example of noahs wife and the wife of lot for those who do not believe
they were under two of our righteous slaves and they defrauded them
it was said to them enter the fire with those who did not enter it
and allah propoundeth for those who believe when the wife of firawn prayed o lord build me a house in paradise and save me from the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and the example of maryam the daughter of imran who guarded her chastity – we therefore breathed into her a spirit from ourselves – and she testified for the words of her lord and his books
the woman who maintained her chastity – he therefore breathed into him of his lord and his books and she was among the obedient
blessed be he in whose hand is the dominion and he is powerful over everything
who created you in order to try you by means of death and to try you by what you have to do
he is allmighty and forgiving
who created the seven skies one above another
you can see no one can see except the most gracious
turn your eyes again do you see any fissures
then return thy gaze again and again and again
and indeed we have beautified the lower heaven with lamps and have made them weapons against the devils and have made them the devils as the devils the devil to gather them together
and we have prepared for them a blaze
and for those who disbelieve in their lord is the torment of hell
and what a wretched place to return
when they are cast therein they will hear its raging fire
as though it would burst with fury
and whenever a group is cast into it its gates will say to those who have come to you as a warner came to you
they will say yes indeed a warner came to us but we denied him and said god did not send down any thing you are only in great error
and they will say had we but listened or understood we would not have been among the people of hell
so will they confess their guilt
so away with the dwellers of the blazing fire
those who fear their lord unseen ie they do not see him in the least coming to their lord and for them is forgiveness and a great reward
whether you discuss a thing or keep your discourse secret or publish it verily allah is the allknower of what is in the breasts
what does he not know he who has created not know his creation
he hath made the earth unto you an expanse
so eat of the fruits of the land and give thanks to him
and the returning is to us and the earth is the destination
or are you confident that he will not cause the heaven to sink you in the earth with you or cause it to fall upon it
or are ye secure that he who is in heaven will not send against you a violent whirlwind
then you will know how terrible was my punishment and how terrible was my warning
and assuredly those before them belied then how terrible was my wrath
have they not seen the birds above them flying wings spread out or folded
he is the allseer of everything
who is he besides the most beneficent that can be an army to you to help you
the unbelievers are only in delusion
who is he that can provide for you if he should withhold his provision
nay but they continue in pride and they flee from the truth
what is he then who is guided or is he who walks upright on a straight path
say thou he it is who hath brought you forth and hath endowed you with hearing and sights and hearts
little thanks you give
say it is he who has created you in the earth and to him you will be gathered in the hereafter
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say i am only a man and i am not a messenger to be sent by god to whom all things has been sent as a clear warner
and when they see it they will behold it it will be said this is what you were promised
say what think you if god destroys me and those with me or is benevolent to us who will help me against us
say he is the benevolent in him do we believe and in him do we surrender
you will come to know who is in manifest error
say what think you if in the morning your water were to dry who will bring you running water from the earth
nun
by the pen and what they inscribe
you o muhammad saw are not by the grace of your lord a madman
and verily thine shall be an unending reward
and verily thou art of a high and noble disposition
so very soon you will see and they too will realise –
who is distracted
verily your lord it is he who knows best who strays from his way and he knows best who has gone astray from his way
so do not comply with those who deny
they are the people of the city who wish that thou shouldst compromise then they would compromise
and do not listen to any excessive oath maker ignoble person
backbiter going about with slander
hinderer of the good transgressor sinful
crude and above all mean and infamous
because he has wealth and sons
when our verses of the quran are recited to him he says tales of the ancients
we shall brand him on the muzzle
we have tried them as they tried the owners of the garden when they swore that pluck in the morning
and we have not been feeding the poor
so the garden became black by the morning like a pitch dark night in complete ruins
so in the morning it became as if harvested
then they called out one to another as soon as the morning broke
he said what is the matter with you
so they departed conversing in secret low tones saying
so they went off with whispering to one another
and they went in the morning with strong intention thinking that they have power to prevent the poor taking anything of the fruits therefrom
then when they saw it they said “ did you not eat ”
nay but we are deprived of the fruits
the most moderate of them said said said said did i not tell you why do you not proclaim his purity
they said glory be to him
we have wronged ourselves
then they turned one against another in blaming
they said woe alas for us truly we were insolent
we are the rangers
belike our lord may exchange a better garden than this
such is the chastisement and the chastisement of the last abode is greater if they but know
for the godfearing shall be gardens of bliss with god that is gardens of bliss
shall we equate the muslims to the guilty
what ails you then how you judge
or have you a book through which you learn
that therein is yours that which ye may choose
or have you oaths from us reaching to the day of resurrection that you shall certainly be raised up again
ask them which of them will guarantee that
or have they any partners
then bring their partners if what they say is true
on the day when the shin will be exposed and they will be called to prostrate themselves they will be unable used as a metaphor
downcast will be their looks abjectness will overspread them
they had indeed been called to prostrate themselves while they were whole
so leave him who cries lies to this discourse
we shall lead them step by step by step we lead them on in a way they know not
and i will give them respite
verily my plan is firm
or is it that you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ask any fee from them so they are burdened with the penalty
or is the unseen in their keeping and so they are writing it down
so wait with patience for the decision of your lord and do not be like onah of the fish who called to his lord when he was choked with anger
but for his grace he would have been left in a state of humiliation and misery
but his lord chose him and made him of the righteous
and verily those who disbelieve wellnigh cause thee to stumble with their looks when they hear the admonition and they say verily he is mad
and they used to say “ indeed they have heard ”
and it is naught but an admonition unto the worlds
the inevitable calamity
what is the reality
how will you comprehend what the concrete reality
thamud and ad denied the consequential calamity
as for thamud they were destroyed by a storm of thunder and lightning
as for ad they were destroyed by a furious violent wind
he determined it eight years of your lord that you may see them seven nights and eight days in succession reflect
beholdest thou any of them remaining
and firaun pharaoh and those before him and the cities overthrown the towns of lout lot committed sin and the people of lout lot committed sin
surely they are in a state of pride and opposition
and when the water rose beyond its limits nuhs noah flood we carried you in the floating ship that was constructed by nuh noah
in order that we may make it a warning for you and that the ears that store may remember
when the trumpet blast is sounded a second blowing
and the earth and the mountains shall be removed from their places and crushed with a single crushing
then on that day the great event will come to pass
and the heaven and the angels are in a part of the heavens and the earth and the angels will be a day of resurrection
and the angels will stand upon its sides and on that day eight angels will carry above them their throne of your lord
on that day you will be exposed not one secret of yours concealed
then as for him who is given his book in his right hand he shall say here take and read my account
i was sure that i should be a meeter of my reckoning
so he shall be in a pleasing life
in a lofty garden –
near the lotetree of the spring fiercely boiling
eat and drink with wholesome appetite for that you were working
but as for him who is given his book in his left hand he shall say oh would that i had not been given my book
and not known my account
would that it had been the end death
my wealth has not availed me
vanished has my power from me
lay hold of him and chain him
then throw him in the blazing fire
then fasten him with a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits
verily he was a great reward
nor he urged on others the feeding of almiskin the poor
and he has no friend today for him
and none can eat except the khatiun sinners disbelievers polytheists etc
none will eat it but the khatiun sinners disbelievers polytheists etc
so i swear by the afterglow of sunset
and by that you do not see
that this is indeed the word of an honoured messenger
and it is not the speech of a poet
how little is it that you believe
nor is it the word of a soothsayer
little do you remember
a sending down from the lord of all being
and had he invented against us any sayings
we would have seized him by his right hand
then cut off his aorta
and not one of you could have defended him
and verily this quran is an admonition unto the godfearing
and indeed we know that some among you will cry lies
and verily it is an absolute truth with certainty
and verily it is an absolute truth with certainty
so glorify the name of your lord the great
from god the lord of the steps of progression
upon the disbelievers which none can avert
it was said god who caused the stages to restore the water to be sunk into the earth then it was so that he was filled with awe of him
the angels and the ruh jibrael gabriel ascend to him in a day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years
so be patient o muhammad saw with a good patience
they deem it to be remote
but we see it quite near
the day the sky will be like molten brass
and the mountains shall be like plucked wooltufts
and no friend inquires after friend
though within sight of one another
fain would his ransom himself from the torment of that day by his children
and his wife and his brother
and his kin that sheltered him
and all those who are on the earth so that it might save himself
no
it is pure white flame
scorching the skin
calling him who drew back and turned away
woe to every slanderer backbiter
man was created of haste
irritable discontented when evil touches him
and if good toucheth him he is begrudging
and those who strictly guard their five compulsory congregational salawat prayers at their fixed stated hours
those who are regular in their prayers
and in their properties there was the right of the beggar and non beggar
for the beggar and the outcast
those who believe in the day of judgement to be true
and those who fear the punishment of their lord
verily the torment of their lord is that before which none can feel secure
and those who protect their private organs from adultery
except with their wives and the bondwomen in their possession for there is no reproach on them
but those who covet more than this will be transgressors
and those who protect their trusts and their covenant
who dissimulate
and those who protect their prayers
those shall dwell in gardens honoured
what aileth those who disbelieve toward thee hastening
sitting in groups on the right and on the left of you o muhammad saw
does every one of them wish to enter the garden of tranquility
nay verily it is an admonition
we have indeed created them from what they know
so i swear by the lord of the easts and the wests that we are certainly able
so i swear by the lord of the easts and the wests that we are certainly able
so leave them alone to plunge and play until they encounter that day of theirs which they are promised
the day they will come out of the graves in haste as if rushing towards their goals
eyes lowered shame attending
this is the day of judgement which they will not be able to hide
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people saying ‘ warn your people before the painful punishment comes upon them ”
he said o my people i am unto you a clear warner
that you should worship allah alone and be dutiful to him and obey me
he will forgive you your sins and will defer you to a stated term
verily allah when it cometh can not be delayed if you but that allah respite
he said my lord verily i have called my people night and day
but the more i called they only ran the farther away from me
and verily every time i called them that thou mayest forgive them they thrust their fingers into their ears covered themselves with their garments and became wayward and behaved with downright insolence
then verily i called them openly
then verily spake unto them openly and secretly also i addressed them
i said to them ask forgiveness from your lord verily he is oftforgiving most merciful
i said i said ask forgiveness from your lord he will send down rain on you he will surely turn to you in penitence
and will succour you with wealth and sons
what aileth you then that ye expect not in allah majesty
‘ whereas he has created you by stages ’
have you not seen how god has created the seven heavens one above another
and has set the moon therein for a light and has set the sun a lamp
and allah hath caused you to grow from the earth as a growth
then he will return you back to it and bring you out again
and allah has made the earth a bed for you and has made the earth a spreading
that you may walk therein in it and that you may walk on
he said “ they have no son and they have no share except him who brings me a son and no one can have been given by virtue
and who have plotted a tremendous plot
and said do not abandon your gods and do not abandon wadda or suwa or yaghuth yauq or nasr
and indeed they have misled many
and increase thou these wrongdoers in naught save error
because of their sins they were drowned and then they were drowned and then they were made to enter into the fire so they did not find any supporter for themselves against allah
and nuh said my lord leave not one of the disbelievers on the earth
surely if you leave them they will mislead your slaves and their auliya friends and helpers
my lord forgive me and my parents and him who entereth my house as a believer and believing men and believing women and increase not the wrongdoers
say thou a group among the jinns and men who said verily we have heard a young man
guiding to rectitude wherefore we believe in it and we shall never associate any one with our lord anyone
and that our lord has taken a son for himself he has taken a son
and the foolish among us say preposterous things of god
and we had thought that men and jinn would never speak against god a lie
and verily there were some men among mankind who would seek refuge with some jinns but it is a party of mankind that they would seek refuge with some of mankind
even as they thought that god would never raise up anyone
and we sought to reach the heaven but we found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires
‘ and that we sometimes used to sit in some places in sit in our ears so whoever finds a fiery comet waiting for him ’
and we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their lord intends for them rectitude
and of us are some who say we are the righteous
and we could not weaken the power of god on earth nor can we frustrate him by flight
we believe in the way of rectitude wherefore we believe in it and we have believed in it and in him we have put our trust
and of us are some who have submitted and of us are some who have submitted in islam
those they are the rightminded
and as for those who deviated they have become firewood for gehenna
and had they kept on the path surely we would have watered them with rain plenteous
that we might try them thereby
and whosoever turneth away from the remembrance of his lord and he shall thrust him into a torment vehement
the places of worship are for god there is no god along with god
when god servant to prays for he prays apart from his servant
say i call on my lord alone and i do not associate any one with him
say o muhammad saw i possess no power over you either for harm or benefit
say thou verily i shall find beside allah none can protect me from allah nor can i find beside allah any refuge
i only convey to you the message clearly and the message clearly is only for god and the faithful
and whosoever disobeyeth allah and his apostle and transgresseth his statutes him he shall cause to enter the fire as an abider therein and unto him shall be a torment ignominous
and anon ye shall know who is worse in position and even if they see that which they were promised then they will know who is weaker in protectors and fewer in number
say i do not know if what you are promised is near or whether my lord will appoint for it a distant term
the knower of the unseen and he discloses not his unseen to anyone
except for he he has chosen and appoints guardians to watch over them
that is what is sent down from their lord
he comprehends what they have wrought in his sight and has counted each one of them and he keeps an eye on his part
o you enfolded in your mantle of reform
stand up for worship during the night except a little
a half of it or diminish a little
or some enjoyment in the revelation of this world and then after a little
verily we anon we shall cast upon thee a weighty word
surely in the watches of the night is most receptive and words more telling
indeed during the day you have a long schedule of occupations
and remember the name of your lord and leaving others devote yourself solely to him
lord of the east and the west there is no god but he
so take him alone as wakil disposer of your affairs
and bear thou patiently what they say and forsake them graciously
leave me with him whom i created alone and let them alone with the fabrications
verily with us are heavy fetters and scorch
and food that chokes and a painful chastisement
on a day whereon the earth and the mountains shall quake and the mountains become a slipping heap of sand
we have sent you a messenger as a witness against you and we have sent a messenger to the pharaoh
so firaun pharaoh disobeyed the noble messenger so we seized him with a severe seizure
how then if ye disbelieve will ye escape on a day that shall make the children greyheaded
the heavens itself will be rent asunder on that day
his promise needs must be fulfilled
verily he is the guide of his lord
your lord knows that you are occupied by night with you devotions for nearly twothirds of the night or half the night or onethird of it as do many others with you
he knows that you are unable to do it but he has turned you astray
so recite as much of the quran as is feasible
he knows that you will stand up in the night of the day and he knows that some of you stand up in the night and some others may travel in the land and some of you are travelling
so recite of the quran so much as is feasible
that is best in this world and that allah may reward with him who has more excellent in reward with him
and ask gods forgiveness god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o you enfolded in your mantle of reform
arise and warn
and magnify your lord
and keep your clothes clean
and stay away from idols
and do not favour others in order to be favoured with more
and be patient for the sake of your lord ie perform your duty to allah
when the trumpet blast is sounded
that day will be a harsh day
for the unbelievers not easy
leave me with him whom i created alone
and gave him abundant wealth
and sons standing before him
and made the worst thing for him
and he is indeed perished
nay verily he is forward unto our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
i shall oblige him to climb a slippery mountain in the hellfire called assaud or to face a severe torment
verily he thought and plotted
may he be accursed how he planned
again perish he how maliciously he devised
then he looked around
then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way
then he turned away and was haughty
and he said this is nothing but magic from of old
this is nothing but the word of a human being
i will cast him into hellfire
and what shall make thee know that which she is
it spares not neither leaves alone
scorching the skin
over it are nineteen guards
and we have appointed hell as a number of jinn and we have not appointed aught but as a trial for those who disbelieve and who disbelieve that they may be unbelievers
thus doth allah lead astray whom he wills and that he may forgive whom he wills
thus doth allah lead whom he wills astray and none can guide whom he wills
and this hell is nothing but an admonition unto the worlds
nay by the moon
and by the night when it departs
and by the dawn when it brightens
verily it is one of the greatest woes
a warning unto humankind
to whoever of you desires to go forward or lag behind
every soul is pledged to what it does
except the chosen ones among your creatures
sitting in the gardens asking
what about almujrimun criminals disbelievers etc and they will be mocked at the angels
what led you into the scorching fire
they will say we were not of those who used to offer their salat prayers
nor urged others to feed almiskin the poor
and we plunged along with the plungers
and we used to belie the day of recompense
until the certain came to us
so the intercession of the intercessors will not benefit them
fleeing from a hunter or a lion or a beast of prey
as though they were asses startled
fleeing from a hunter or a lion or a beast of prey
in fact every one of them wants to be given pages spread out coming from allah with a writing that islam is the right religion and muhammad saw has come with the truth from allah the lord of the heavens and the earth and to him is the prophet
nay but they fear not the hereafter from allahs punishment
nay verily this quran is an admonition
so whoever wills may remember it
and they will not remember except as allah wills
forgive me and overlook our faults
i swear by the day of resurrection
no i swear by the reproachful soul
does man assume that we will never assemble his bones
yes indeed we are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers
nay but man desires to continue on as a libertine
he asks when will the day of resurrection be
but when the sight is dazed
and the moon shall be ecliped
and the sun and moon are conjoined
and when the sun is folded up
no there is no refuge
unto thy lord that day is the recourse
on that day man will be informed of what he sent forward of his evil or good deeds and what he left behind of good or evil
nay man shall be a witness against himself as his body parts skin hands legs etc shall speak about his deeds
even though he offer his excuses
move not thy tongue therewith that thou mayest hasten therewith
ours it is to gather it and to recite it
and when we have recited it to you o muhammad saw through jibrael gabriel then follow what is revealed to its the qurans recital
then indeed to explain its details to you is upon us
no indeed but you love the hasty world
and leave the hereafter
many faces will be contrite on that day
looking toward their lord
and faces on that day shall be scowling
that is because they are called to account of that which is in the hearts of men
nay when the soul reaches to the collar bone ie up to the throat in its exit
and it is said who is creates the first
and he thinks that it is the parting
and one shin will curl up with the other shin
and keep your clothes clean
for he neither believed nor prayed
but only disavowed and turned away
then he went back to his home in pride
again woe to you o man disbeliever and then again woe to you
again woe to you o man disbeliever and then again woe to you
does man assume that he will be let loose
was he not a spermdrop spilled
then he became a clot then he created him and formed him
and he created from him two kinds male and female
is not that one then able to quicken the dead
has there not come upon man a space of time when he was not at all
we created man of a spermdrop a mingling and we made him hearing seeing
we surely showed him the way whether he be grateful or ungrateful
we have prepared for the unbelievers chains fetters and a blaze
verily the abrar pious who fear allah and avoid evil shall drink a cup of wine mixed with water from a spring in paradise called kafur
it is allah who created the water of his slaves that are from a spring of water
they fulfill their vows and dread a day whose evil is widespread
and they give food inspite of their love for it or for the love of him to miskin poor the orphan and the captive
saying we feed you for the sake of god desiring neither recompense nor thanks
we fear a day whereon they will turn the faces and say our lord verily we fear that there will befall thee a day of distress
so god saved them from the evil of that day and gave them freshness and joy
and reward them for their perseverence paradise and silken robes
reclining therein on raised thrones they will see there neither the excessive heat of hell nor the excessive heat of hell
and the shade thereof is close upon them and the bunches of fruit thereof will hang low within their reach
and amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and also goblets of glass
crystalclear made of silver they will determine the measure thereof according to their wishes
and therein they shall be given to drink a cup whereof the admixture will be ginger
a spring in paradise called salsabeel
and boys of everlasting youth will go about attending them looking at them you would think that they were pearls dispersed
and when you look around you see delights and great dominion
upon them shall be garments of fine green silk and of brocades
this is a reward for the virtuous and indeed your lord has given them an excellent reward
this is your recompense and your endeavour has been accepted
we have sent down to you o muhammad saw the quran full of wisdom and we have sent down the quran in your forces that you may be seen
so be thou patient under the judgment of thy lord and obey not thou of them sinner or unbeliever
and remember thou the name of thy lord in the morning and in the evening
and bow in homage part of the night and glorify him
verily these men love what hastes away and forget the day of judgement ahead as men and the count of them into the night and be a heavy day
and we have created them and strengthened their joints and when we will we shall exchange their likes
this is an admonition so whosoever wills let him take a way unto his lord
but you can not will unless god wills
god is allknowing and allwise
he admits whosoever he wills to his benevolence
and he has prepared for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc a painful torment
by the winds or angels or the messengers of allah sent forth one after another
and those that strike violently
by the spreading winds spreading
and by the angels that bring the revelations from allah
and those that bring down the reminder
to cut off or to warn
verily the promise made to you is true
when the stars shall be thrown down
when the heaven is split asunder
when the mountains are made into dust and blown away
and when the messengers are gathered to their time appointed
for what day is that time fixed
the day of judgement
and what shall make thee know that which the day of requital is
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not destroy the ancients
then we shall cause to follow them the latter ones
thus do we deal with the mujrimun polytheists disbelievers sinners criminals etc
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not create you from a worthless water semen etc
in a safe place
till a known term decreed
we are the rangers
how well do we calculate
ruin is for the deniers on that day
did we not make the earth a storehouse
for the living and the dead
and we have placed high mountains as anchors in it and gave you sweet water to drink
ruin is for the deniers on that day
depart unto that which ye were wo nt to belie
depart to a triplemassing shadow
neither shading nor availing against the flame
verily it shall cast forth sparks like unto a castle
as if they were jimalatun sufr yellow camels or bundles of ropes
ruin is for the deniers on that day
this is a day when they will not be able to speak during some part of it
nor will they be given permission to present excuses
ruin is for the deniers on that day
it will be said to them “ this is the day of your forefathers ”
if you have a trick try you now to trick me
ruin is for the deniers on that day
verily the godfearing shall be amid shades and springs
and with fruit from that which they choose
and we shall marry them with maidens wide lovely eyes as a few young men in paradise
thus do we reward the virtuous
ruin is for the deniers on that day
eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while
you are indeed guilty of excess
ruin is for the deniers on that day
and when it is said to them “ offer the prayer ” – they do not
ruin is for the deniers on that day
in what discourse then will they believe
of what are they asking one another
about the great news ie islamic monotheism the quran which prophet muhammad peace be upon him brought and the day of resurrection etc
about which they have been differing
again no indeed they shall soon know
again by no means anon they shall know
and the earth we have made the mountains as a bed
and the mountains as pegs
and we have created you in pairs
and we have made your sleep as a rest
and we have made the night a covering through its darkness
and have made the day for livelihood
and we have builded over you seven strong heavens
and we have made therein lamps glowing
and have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant water
that we may produce from it grain and vegetation
and gardens thick with trees
verily the day of decision is their appointed time
the day the trumpet blast is sounded you will come in hordes
and the heaven will have been opened and it will have become doors
and the mountains are set in motion and become a vapour
and when hellfire shall be kindled to fierce ablaze
the rebels abode
they will remain in it for ages
tasting therein neither coolness nor any drink
except boiling water and dirty wound discharges
a fitting reward
verily they had no fear of the reckoning
and they denied our signs to the extreme
and everything we have numbered in a book
taste then the torment
we are not going to be believers
verily for the godfearing is an achievement
gardens and vineyards
and fullbreasted maidens of equal age
and a cup overflowing
they will hear no blasphemies there or disavowals
a reward from your lord – a grossly sufficient bestowal
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the most beneficent none can dare to speak with him except the lord of the throne of the most beneficent none can avert
the day the spirit takes its stand in rows none will be able to speak except him whom the most gracious allows and who has no one
that day is certain
so let him who desires take the way to his lord
we have warned you of a near chastisement upon the day when man will see what his hands have forwarded and the unbeliever says would that i were dust
by the angels who drag forth vehemently
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
and those who glide swimmingly
and by those that press forward as in a race ie the angels or stars or the horses etc
and then they manage the affair
on the day when the trembling one will tremble the disbelievers will certainly taste the punishment
and there shall follow it the next blast
hearts on that day will be throbbing
eyes be lowered in submission
they will say when we have become dead and have turned to dust and bones that is a return remote
when we have become bones decayed
they say that then shall be a losing return
it will only be a single blast
and behold they are awakened
has the story of moses come to you
when his lord called him in the holy valley of tuwa
firaun pharaoh said go to firaun pharaoh verily he has transgressed all bounds in disbelief and disobedience and behaved as an arrogant and as a tyrant
and say hast thou observed him who hath taken purified himself
and that i may guide thee to thy lord so that thou shalt guide thee
so moosa showed him a magnificent sign
but firaun pharaoh belied and disobeyed
then he turned away deliberating
then he gathered his people and cried aloud
and he said i am your lord the highest of them all
so god seized him in the chastisement of the last world and the first
verily in this is a sign for those who fear allah and keep their duty to him
are you more difficult to create or the heavens
and allah has cursed him
he raised its roof and made it proper
and he made its night dark and started its light
and after it spread out the earth
and he brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture
and the mountains he hath fixed firmly
an enjoyment for you and your flocks
when the great calamity comes
on that day man will recall what he strove for
and hell will be made visible to all those who can see
then he was insolent
and preferred the present life
verily the scorch that shall be his resort
but as for him who feared standing before his lord and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts
verily paradise will be his abode
they ask you o muhammad peace be upon him about the hour when will be its appointed time
what concern do you have regarding its explanation you are not bound to tell them
unto thy lord is the knowledge of the limit fixed therefor
you o muhammad saw are only a warner ie your duty is to convey allahs message to mankind but the guidance is in allahs hand
the day they see it it will seem as if they had stayed in this world but only an evening or its forenoon
he frowned and turned away
because there came to him the blind man ie abdullah bin ummmaktum who came to the prophet peace be upon him while he was preaching to one or some others or some others or some of the quraish chiefs
what do you know he may be of the pure
or that he may accept advice so the advice may benefit him
as for him who regardeth himself selfsufficient
to him thou attendest
though it is not thy concern if he does not cleanse himself
and as for him who cometh unto thee running
and he who fears
you neglect
by no means verily this quran is an admonition
so whoever wills may remember it
contained in honoured pages
exalted purified
by the hands of scribes
abasing exalting
perish man how ungrateful he is
how ungrateful he is
of what thing hath he created him
from a single sperm he created then proportioned him
then he makes the path easy for him
then he caused him to die and made him to be buried
then when he wills he raises him
no indeed man has not accomplished his bidding
let man consider his nourishment
that we watered it in abundance
and grapes and vegetables
and we cause therein the grain to grow
and grapes and herbage
and olives and datepalms
and dense gardens
and fruits and abba herbage etc
an enjoyment for you and your flocks
then when the great catastrophe comes
on that day man will run away from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his wife and his sons
everyman that day will have enough to make him careless of others
many faces will be joyous on that day
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
many a face will be honoured
blackness overcoming them
they are the unbelievers transgressors
when the sun shall be wound round
and when the stars shall dart down
and when the mountains are made into dust and blown away
and when milch camels roam abandoned
when the savage beasts shall be mustered
when the oceans surge and swell
and when the souls shall be joined with their bodies
and when the girlchild who was buried alive is asked
for what sin she was killed
when the ledgers are laid open
when the heaven is split asunder
when the scorch shall be made to blaze
and when the garden shall be brought nigh
every soul will come to know what it has sent ahead and what it left behind
so i swear by the planets that recede ie disappear during the day and appear during the night
moving swiftly and hiding themselves
by the night when it envelopeth
by the forenoon after sunrise
that this is indeed the word of an honoured messenger
owner of strength of established dignity with the lord of the throne
cast down thy staff
your companion is not possessed
and indeed he muhammad saw saw him jibrael gabriel in the clear horizon towards the east
and he is not chary of pursuing them
and it is not the word of an outcast shaitan satan
whither then go ye
it is naught but an admonition unto the worlds
for the one among you who wishes to become upright
but will you can not unless god wills the lord of all being
when the heaven is split asunder
and when the stars shall be scattered
when the oceans surge and swell
when the tombs are overthrown
then every soul will know what it had sent ahead and what it had left behind
o man
what deceived you o muhammad saw as the most beneficent allah
who created thee then moulded thee then proportioned thee
he moulded you into whatever shape he willed
nay but you deny the recompense reward for good deeds
and indeed there are some guardians over you
honourablel scribes
who know what you do
verily the virtuous shall be in delight
and the libertines shall be in a fiery furnace
roasting therein on the day of doom
and thence they shall not be allowed to be absent
how can you comprehend what the day of judgement is
again what shall teach thee what is the day of doom
the day when no soul will be wronged at another and the matter will be decided for god
woe to almutaffifin those who give less in measure and weight decrease the rights of others
and those who when they take the measure from men demand full measure
and those who when they give by measure or weight with fairness
do they not think they will be raised again
on a grievous day
the day when all mankind will stand before the lord of all the worlds
no
the ledger of the wicked will be in the lowest depths sijjin
and what shall make thee know that which sijjin is
a register inscribed
ruin is for the deniers on that day
those who belie the day of requital
and none belieth it save each trespasser sinner
when our verses of the quran are recited to him he says tales of the ancients
no
in fact their hearts were sealed by you and they do not understand
nay but they evildoers will be veiled from seeing their lord that day
then verily they will be roasted into the scorch
“ this is what you used to deny ”
no
verily the record writing down the preserved tablet
and what shall make thee know that which the crushing fire is
a register inscribed
witnessed by those who are honoured
verily the virtuous shall be in delight
on high thrones watching
you will recognise in their faces the brightness of delight
they will be given to drink pure sealed wine
with a sealing of musk which those who aspire for the best should desire
nun
a fountain at which do drink those brought nigh
veriiy those who have sinned were wo nt at those who had believed to laugh
and whenever they passed by them used to wink one to another in mockery
and when they returned to their people they would return jesting
and when they saw them they said verily these are the strayed ones
but they were not sent as guardians over them
so this day the believers who laugh at the disbelievers
on high thrones watching
will not the disbelievers get repaid for what they used to do
when the heaven is split asunder
and hearkens to its lord and is dutiful
when the earth is stretched out taut
and casts forth what is in it and voids itself
and hearkens to its lord and is dutiful
o man you have to strive and go on your lord with full dedication and fear your lord
but as for him who is given his book in his right hand
he surely will receive an easy reckoning
and will return to his family in joy
but as for him who is given his book behind his back
he will invoke his destruction
and will enter a blazing fire and made to taste its burning
verily he was among his people because of his people had been exulting in the hereafter
he assumed that he does not have to return
no
surely his lord was ever beholding him
i swear by the twilight
and by the night and what it covers
and the moon when it is at the full
you are in serious doubt
what is the matter with them that they believe not
and when the quran is recited to them they do not fall prostrate
in fact the disbelievers keep denying
and allah knows what they hide in their breasts
so announce to them a painful torment
except those who believe and do the right
and theirs shall be a hire unending
by the heaven full of paths
and by the day promised
and by the day witnessing and the day witnessed
slain were the men of the pit
who will be fuel of hell
when they were covered over with the fire
and were themselves witnesses of what they did
he is allmighty and allwise
who is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
and allah is witness over all things
and the muslim men and muslim women and the disbelievers are indeed all their deeds are in vain – so the punishment of hell and they have to return to them – the punishment of the fire of hell
but those who believe and do the right will be gardens with streams of running water running by where they will for ever abide
that is the supreme achievement
verily the grip of thine lord is severe
verily he it is who begins punishment and repeats punishment in the hereafter or originates the creation of everything and then repeats it on the day of resurrection
and he is the oftforgiving the most merciful
lord of the throne the allglorious
doer of whatsoever he intendeth
has the story of the armies reach you
the armies of firaun and the tribe of thamud
nay but the unbelievers still cry lies
and allah is after them has them surrounded
nay this is an admonition
in a preserved tablet
by the heaven and the nightcomer
and what shall make thee know that which the crushing fire is
it is the star shing brightly
there is no human being but has a protector over him or her ie angels incharge of each human being guarding him writing his good and bad deeds etc
so let man consider of what he was created from
he was created of gushing water
issuing between the loins and the breastbones
verily allah is able to restore him
the day when the secrets will be examined
then he shall have no power nor any helper
by the heaven full of paths
by the earth that scatter off
verily this is a decisive word
and it is not a thing for amusement
they are hatching up a plot
and i too am planning a plan
so give them some respite
glorify the name of your lord the supreme
who created and shaped
and who has measured preordainments for each and everything even to be blessed or wretched then guided ie showed mankind the right as well as wrong paths and guided the animals to pasture
who brings out the pastures
then made it a blackening wrack
we shall make you recite the quran so that you will not forget it
except what allah wills
he knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and what is behind them
we shall ease you both the way of fortune for you
therefore advise if advising is beneficial
and is he who feareth
and the wretched shunneth it
who will enter the great fire and made to taste its burning
then he shall neither die therein nor live
indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself ie obeys and performs all that allah ordered by following the true faith of islamic monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds
and recites the name of his lord and serves with devotion
nay but you prefer the present life
and the world to come is better and more enduring
verily this is in writs ancient
ibrahim abraham said o my lord
has the news of the calamity of the calamity that will overwhelm has come to you
many faces will be contrite on that day
labouring hard in the worldly life by worshipping others besides allah weary in the hereafter with humility and disgrace
roasting at a scorching fire
watered at a boiling fountain
no food will be theirs save bitter thorn
which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger
many faces will be joyous on that day
with their endeavour well pleased
in a lofty garden –
they will hear no blasphemies there or disavowals
therein a running fountain
therein shall be thrones raised high
and goblets ready placed
and cushions set in rows
and rich carpets all spread out
do they not see the camel – how it has been created
and at the heaven how it is raised
and at the mountains how they are rooted and fixed firm
and at the earth how it is outspread
you are only a reminder
you are not a guardian over them
except for one who turns away and disbelieves
so allah will mete out to him the greatest punishment
verily to us is their return
then indeed to us is their reckoning
by the dawn
and by oath of ten nights
and by the even and the odd
and by the night when it departs
in that is a lesson for men possessed of minds
hast thou not seen how thy lord did with ad
iram of the pillars
the like of which were not created in the land
and with thamud who hewed out rocks in the valley
and with firaun pharaoh who had pegs who used to torture men by binding them to pegs
who all were insolent in the land
and who brings therein mischief and high
your lord poured on them different kinds of severe torment
verily your lord is ever watchful over them
man says his lord has honoured me and i fear he will bestow him on me a good provision
but when his lord tries him and stints for him his provision then he says my lord has despised me
no indeed but you honour not the orphan
and you urge not the feeding of the needy
and devour the inheritance devouring greedily
and love wealth with all your heart
nay but when the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall down by a horrible thing
and your lord comes with the heart
and hell will be brought near that day
on that day man will remember but how will remembrance avail him
he will say “ alas – if only i had sent some good deeds ahead during my lifetime ”
on that day allah will torment him with his torment
and none can bind as he will bind
o you tranquil soul
return unto thy lord wellpleased wellpleasing
return unto thy lord wellpleased wellpleasing
enter then my garden
i swear by this city makkah
and thou shalt be allowed in yonder city
and by the begetter ie adam and that which he begot ie his progeny
verily we have created man in trouble
thinks he that none can overcome him
he says boastfully i have wasted wealth in abundance
thinks he that none sees him
did we not make two eyes for him
and a tongue and two lips
and showed him two highways of good and evil
and did not make the scale of the steep valley
and what shall make thee know that which the steep is
the freeing of a slave
or a poor man cleaving to the dust
to an orphan near of kin
or a poor man cleaving to the dust
and we have enjoined on each other to be kind of prayer and counsel each other to be merciful
these are the people of the right hand
and those who disbelieve our signs they are the fellows of the lefthand
the fire will vault them over
by the sun and its brightness
and the moon when she followeth him
and by the day when it displays him
and by the night when it enshrouds him
and by the heaven and that which built it
and by the earth and him who spread it
and the soul and what it had made it known
and he who purifies it from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has ordained
indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself ie obeys and performs all that allah ordered by following the true faith of islamic monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds
and he who confines it will surely come to grief
the thamud denied the truth in their perverseness
the most moderate of them will not be able to hide from him
allah said to them the shecamel of allah may send down her drink
but they called him a liar and hamstrung her
so their lord seized them with a torment because of their sins and destroyed them for their sins and they were a great torment
and he does not fear its coming behind to take vengeance
by the night when it envelopeth
and by the day when it displays him
and by him who created male and female
surely your striving is to diverse ends
as for him who gives and is godfearing
and affirms goodness
and we shall make smooth for him the path for one another
but as for him who is greedy miser and thinks himself selfsufficient
and who belieth the good
we shall ease him to the hardship
his wealth will not avail him when he falls into ruin
surely upon us rests the guidance
and indeed the hereafter and this world both belong to us
so i warn you of the blazing fire
none shall enter it save the most wretched
who belieth and turneth away
and avoid it shall the most pious
who gives his wealth in order to be pure
and no one shall have to return his reward without his lord
but only the reward of your lord the supreme
and presently he shall become wellpleased
by the forenoon after sunrise
and by the night when it departs
your lord o muhammad peace be upon him has neither forsaken you nor hated you
and indeed the latter is better for you than the former
and verily your lord will give you and you will be content
did he not find you an orphan and take care of you
and found you deeply engrossed in his love so directed you
did he not find you needy and suffice you
so do not oppress the orphan
and do not drive the beggar away
and keep recounting the favours of your lord
did we not expand thy breast for thee
and by oath of those who carry away their burden
which weighed down thy back
and we have exalted your remembrance for you
so indeed along with every hardship is ease
with hardship comes ease
so when you have finished from your occupation then stand up for allahs worship ie stand up for allahs worship
and turn to your lord with all your love
by the fig by the olive
by mount sinai
and this soil secure
we indeed created man in the fairest stature
thereafter we made him the lowest of the low
except those who believe and do the right
and theirs shall be a hire unending
what hencefort shall make thee belie the requital
is not allah the greatest of the rulers
read in the name of your lord who created
created man from a clot
read in the name of your lord
who has taught mankind by the pen
taught man that he knew not
nay verily man is in a plain error
as he bethinkest himself selfsufficient
surely thy lord is the returning
have you seen him who restrains
a slave muhammad peace be upon him when he prays
bethinkest thou if he is himself guided
or enjoins piety
what thinkest thou if he cries lies and turns away
does he not know that allah sees
no indeed if he gives not over we shall seize him by the forelock
a forelock lying sinning
so let him call his assembly
we shall call the guards of hell
nay but you see not tafsir attabari vol 25 page 89
by no means do not bow in adoration and draw near to your lord
we have sent it down on the night of power
and what shall make thee know that which the night of power is
the night of power is better than a thousand months
the angels and the ruh jibrael gabriel ascend to him by his permission by his permission by night and at the angels in order to make each difficulty
peace it is till the rising of dawn
the idolaters have no doubt about it
a messenger from among the reciting pages purified
therein true books
and those who were given the scripture jews and christians differed not until after there came to them clear evidence ie prophet muhammad peace be upon him and whatever was revealed to them the message of allah
they were commanded not but that they should worship allah believing purely in him and they kept the prayer established and pay the charity and were its responsible for it
that is the right religion
those who disbelieve from among the people of the scripture jews and christians and almushrikun will abide in the fire of hell
they are the worst of creatures
and those who believe and do righteous works those are the best of creatures
their reward is with their lord gardens of eden with their lord they will abide in it forever
god will admit them to gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
this is for him who fears his lord
when the earth is shaken with its final earthquake
and the earth bringeth forth her burthens
and man says what ails her
on that day she will tell out the tidings thereof
because your lord has inspired it
on that day mankind will proceed in bands that they may be shewn their works
and whosoever hath worked ill of an atoms weight shall behold it
and whosoever hath worked ill of an atoms weight shall behold it
by the chargers panting
and the scorch will be bountiful
and scouring to the raid at dawn
and therein raising dust
cleaving there with a host
verily man is unto his lord ungrateful
and presently he shall become wellpleased
and indeed he loves wealth to the extreme
what does he not know when the contents of the graves are laid bare
and there shall be brounht to light that which is in the breasts
their lord will be aware of their deeds and on that day they will perceive
the startling calamity
what is the event that terrifies the hearts
how will you comprehend what the concrete reality
the day when all men will be like scattered moths
and the mountains shall be like plucked wooltufts
then he whose deeds weigh heavy in the balance
so he shall be in a pleasing life
and as for him whose balances are light
his dwelling shall be the abyss
and what shall make thee know that which the crushing fire is
a flaming fire
the avarice of plenitude keeps you occupied
until you visit the graves ie till you die
nay you will come to know
again no indeed but soon you shall know
yes certainly if you had believed with certainty you would have craved for wealth
you will see hell
again you will see it with certainty
then on that day you will surely be asked about the verity of pleasures
by the afternoon
verily man is in loss
except those who believe and do righteous deeds and counsel each other to be steadfast in order to be kind to the truth and urged one another to the other
woe to every slanderer backbiter
who amasseth wealth and counteth it
does he think his wealth will abide for ever with him
nay but you shall eat and drink and be at a furnace
and what shall make thee know that which the crushing fire is
the fire of hell is a star kindled
which mounteth up to the hearts
covered down upon them
in extended columns
hast thou not seen how thy lord did with the men of the elephant
did he not make their plan go wrong
and he sent against them birds in flocks
hurling against them stones of baked clay
and made them like an empty field of stalks of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle
it is not for you to bring you an exalted provision
and to give their share quickly giving them goodness
so they said “ o my lord
who has fed them against hunger and secured them from fear hunger
beholdest thou him who belieth the requital
that is he who repulses the orphan harshly
nor he urged on others the feeding of almiskin the poor
so woe to those that pray
and those who are watchful of their acts of prayer
who dissimulate
and who withholds even common necessaries
we have indeed to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him give you some advantage of your denying or with reluctance the quran and we have brought them the message of divine grace
so serve your lord with full dedication and sacrifice
verily it is thy traducer who shall be tailless
say o you unbelievers
i worship not that which ye worship
nor will you worship whom i worship
and i am not a guardian over you
nor will you worship whom i worship
to you your religion and to me my religion
when comes the help of allah to you o muhammad peace be upon him against your enemies and the conquest of makkah
and you see men enter gods discipline horde on horde
and magnify your lord with full knowledge
verily he is relenting
perish the hands of abu lahab and perish he
his wealth did not benefit him in the least nor did whatever he earned
he will be roasted in the fire
and his wife too who carries wood thorns of sadan which she used to put on the way of the prophet peace be upon him or use to slander him
on her neck shall be a cord of twisted fibre
say he is god the one the most unique
god is the absolute the most praised of god
he has begotten no one and has begotten
and there is not one equal to him
and from the evil of the envier when he envieth
and from the evil of the darken when it cometh
and from the evil of the darken when it cometh
and from the evil of the witchcrafts when they blow in the knots
and from the evil of the envier when he envieth
say i seek refuge with allah the lord of mankind
the king of mankind
the god of mankind
from the evil of the sneaking whisperer
who whispereth unto the breasts of mankind
of jinn and men
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
in the name of allah the most beneficent the most merciful
the master of the day of doom
you alone we worship and you alone we seek help and help
guide us to the straight way
the path of those whom thou hast favoured not of those on whom is indignation brought down nor of those whom thou wilt thou be lost
alif
lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
and verily it is a book wherein is no doubt and a guidance unto the godfearing
who believe in the unseen and establish prayer and expend of that wherewith we have provided them
who believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you and so do not believe in the hereafter
they are on guidance from their lord and will prosper
they are the successful
as for those who disbelieve it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them – they will not believe
allah has set a seal on their hearts and upon their hearing and over their sights is a covering and unto them is a covering
for them there is a great torment
and among mankind are some who say we believe in allah and in the last day whereas they are not believers
god would surely lead the believers astray and the believers deceive but they only themselves and they do not have sense
sick are their hearts and god adds to their malady
for them is a painful punishment because they used to deny
and when it is said to them “ do not cause turmoil in the earth ” they say “ we are only peacemakers ”
lo verily they they are the blissful
and when it is said to them “ believe as the people believe ” they say “ shall we believe as the fools have believed ”
lo verily it is they who are the fools and yet they know not
and when they meet those who believe they say we believe but when they are alone with their shayatin devils polytheists hypocrites etc they say verily we are with you verily we were sent with you
allah mocks at them and gives them increase in their wrongdoings to wander blindly
they are those who bartered away good guidance for error and gained nothing from slander
their likeness is as the likeness of them who kindleth a fire then when it hath lit up that which is about a fire then allah hath not a light of them whereby he hath scattered therein
deaf dumb blind and they will not return
or like a rainstorm from the sky in which are darkness thunder and lightning they thrust their fingers in their ears due to the thunderclaps fearing death and allah surrounds the disbelievers
the lightning wellnigh snatcheth away their sight whensoever it flasheth on them they walk therein
and when it flashes forth they walk therein they walk therein and when darkness covers them still they stand still
and if allah willed he could have sealed their hearts and they could not have taken away their hearing and their sights
verily allah is able to do all things
o mankind worship your lord who created you and those before you haply so you will be godfearing
who has made the earth a bed for you and has made the earth a bed for you and has sent down from heaven water and has set on it a canopy – and has set up rivals with allah to allah
so do not make another the equal of god knowingly
and if you are in doubt of what we have sent down on our servant then bring a sura like it and call your witnesses apart from god if you are truthful
but if you do not then you will never be able to harm the fire of hell the fuel of which is men and stones prepared for the disbelievers
and those who believe and do righteous good deeds for them await gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and the righteous works that will be of gardens underneath which rivers flow and ever
for them shall be spouses purified and therein they shall be spouses purified and they shall be spouses purified and therein they shall be abiders
verily allah is not ashamed to propound a similitude be it of a gnat or of aught above it
and when those who believe know that it is the truth from their lord and he does what he wills
and he misleads thereby only many thereby and he guides many thereby and he misleads thereby only only those who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
those who break their covenant after ratifying them and sever what allah has ordered to join and then they sever what allah has ordered to join and they are losers in the land and they who make mischief in the land it is they who will be losers
how can allah do you disbelieve in the resurrection
then he will cause you to die then bring you back to life again then you will return
he it is who created for you all that is in the earth then he lifted himself to heaven and levelled them seven heavens and he has knowledge of everything
he is the allknower of everything
and recall what time thine lord said unto the angels verily i am going to place thee in the land
he said verily i know that you know not
and he taught adam the names all of them thereafter he set them up at the angels say bring me the names of these if you are truthful
they said surely you know that we are only great bewitched
except what you have already decreed
verily you are the allknower the allwise
he said o adam declare thou unto them the names of those objects
he said verily i know the unseen of the heavens and the earth and i know what you conceal and what you reveal
and we said to the angels bow yourselves to adam so they bowed themselves save iblis he refused
and they prostrated except iblis satan he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers disobedient to allah
we said o adam
and we said adam dwell thou and thy wife in the garden and eat thereof easefully where you desire but draw not nigh this tree lest you be evildoers
then the satan caused the twain to slip on account thereof and drave them forth from it the twain
for you on the earth there is a place of shelter for a time ordained
then adam learnt from his lord certain words and he relented toward him verily he
he is the relenting the merciful
we said go down from it all of you then if there comes to you guidance from it then whosoever follows my guidance no fear shall come on them nor shall they grieve
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our revelations — these are the inmates of hell
they will abide in it for ever
o descendants of israel
o children of israel remember my favour which i bestowed upon you and fulfill your obligations to my covenant with me and i will give you your pledge and fear none but me
and believe in what i have sent down confirming what is with you and do not be the first to disbelieve in it and be not the first to disbelieve in it and sell it for a little price and fear you me
and mix not truth with falsehood nor conceal the truth ie muhammad peace be upon him is allahs messenger and his qualities are written in your scriptures the taurat torah and the injeel gospel while you know the truth
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and irka ie bow down or submit yourselves with obedience to allah along with arrakiun
what you enjoin righteousness upon people while you forget to practise it yourselves whereas you read the book
will you not then understand
and seek help in patience and assalat the prayer and truly it is hard except for alkhashiun ie the true believers in the oneness of allah those who obey allah with full submission fear from his punishment and believe in his messenger muhammad saw and in his messenger muhammad
who know that they have to meet their lord and that to him they are going to return
o descendants of israel
remember the favour of mine which i bestowed upon you and gave you superiority over others of your time by sending the noble messengers to your nation
and fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will anyone be helped
and remember when we delivered you from firauns pharaoh people who were afflicting you with a horrible torment killing your sons and sparing your women and in it was a trial from your lord
and remember when we separated the sea for you and saved you and drowned firauns pharaoh people while you were looking at them when the seawater covered them
and remember when we appointed for musa moses forty nights and in his absence you took the calf for worship and you were zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
then we pardoned you thereafter that haply ye may return thanks
and remember when we gave musa moses the scripture and the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and the scripture ie jews and the criterion and the right and wrong ie the quran and the criterion of right and wrong doers ie to judge between right and wrong ie
and remember when musa moses said to his people o my people
and assuredly ye took the calf anon ye betook the calf after your own selves and ye were wo nt to worship
and he is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful
he is the relenting the merciful
and remember when you said o musa moses
and recall what time ye said we will not believe thee until allah hath promised you a thunderbolt and ye looked not in height
then we raised you after your death that haply you may return thanks
and we shaded you with clouds and sent down upon you almanna and the quails saying eat of the good things with which we have provided you but they rebelled against themselves
and when we said enter this township in it you will eat and enter in peace and walk in it in peace and will remain seated
we shall increase the gooddoers
but the evildoers substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them so we sent down upon them a plague from the sky because of their wrongdoing people
and remember when musa moses said to his people verily we have asked for water for his people we said strike the stone with your stick
then gushed forth therefrcm twelve springs every people already knew their drinkingplaces
and we said to them eat and drink of what we have provided you with good things and do not corrupt the land and do not corrupt the land with it
they said o musa moses
they said “ o jews
he said what would you exchange that which is better
go down to the city what you ask
and they were covered with humiliation and misery and they drew on themselves the wrath of allah
that is because they disbelieved in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah allah will not raise them up in the least
that was because they disobeyed and were ever transgressing beyond bounds in disbelief
verily those who believe and the jews and the sabians whoever believes in allah and the last day and performs good deeds with their lord and the reward is with their lord and there shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
and recall what time we took a bond from you and raised the tur saying hold ye fast to that which we have vouchsafed unto you and hold ye fast to that which we have vouchsafed unto you and fear allah and remember that which is better than that
then if you turn away thereafter remember that god is independent of you
and assuredly ye know of those amongst you who trespassed in the matter of the sabbath wherefore we said unto them be ye apes despised
so we made this incident of that town a warning to the surrounding towns others of their time and to succeeding generations and a lesson for those who fear allah and we gave them the glad tidings of a people who fear and follow the noble messengers
and remember when musa moses said to his people verily allah commands you that you slaughter a cow
he said i take refuge with allah lest i should be one of the ignorant
they said call on your lord for us that he make plain to us what it is
he said verily he saith she should be a cow neither old nor young but middleaged betwixt that do then as ye are commanded
they said call on your lord for us that he make plain to us what it is
he said verily he saith she should be a yellow cow the colour pleasing to the beholders
and gave him a favour from us
they said call on your lord for us that he make plain to us what it is
we could have kept it motionless if god wills
he said “ i have chosen the company of the governor and made you grow in your sight
they said now hast thou brought the truth
so they slaughtered her and they were wellnigh not doing it
and remember when you slew a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime but allah brought forth what you were hiding
we said smite him with part of the sacrificed cow
thus will allah quicken the dead and he sheweth you his signs that haply ye may under stand
then after that your hearts hardened thereafter turned away from them allah turned away their backs and then there came a sign for them stones out of their wrongdoing
and there are stones with which rivers gush forth and verily among them are not yet any rocks except those who cleave asunder from their water and water flows from them and indeed there are of them stones which fall down for fear of allah
and say god will bring forth some of them greater than he who is godfearing
and allah is not unaware of what you do
so covet you that they would believe you whereas they have been calling you to believe in god and his messenger and then after they had understood it
and when they meet those who believe they say we believe and when they are alone with their tongues what is in their hearts they argue with you before your lord
will you not then understand
do they not know that god knows what they hide and what they disclose
and among them are some who know not what they do except in a state of disbelief and they do not know
woe to those who make the scripture the taurat torah and the injeel gospel is witness from it and also they have not sure faith in the quran and the sunnah path of rectitude
ruin is for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn
and they say the fire shall not touch us save for a number of days
does god not take a covenant from him
yes whoever earns evil and his sin has surrounded him they are the dwellers of the fire they will abide in it forever
and those who believe and do righteous works these are the fellows of the garden
they will abide in it for ever
and remember when we took a covenant from the children of israel worship allah and be dutiful to the kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and speak kindly to men and establish prayer and give the people what is right
then you slid back except a few of you while you are backsliders
and remember when we took compact with you you shall not shed your own blood among yourselves nor drive your people from their habitations and you confirmed the unbelievers with their possessions
then do you agree to it
then you are a party of you who kill one another and drive one another a party of you from their homes and helped each other to drive others
what do you believe in part of the book and disbelieve in part
so what will the reward of those who do evil in the life of this world but god knows what they do
those who have purchased the present life at the price of the hereafter
it will not decrease for them dumb with despair they will not be able to stay in it
and indeed we sent moosa with our knowledge and after him we sent the messengers
whenever a noble messenger came to you with what you did not suit your mood you turned haughty and called some imposters and some others you slay one another you do not believe
and they say our hearts are uncircumcised
in fact allah has cursed them because of their disbelief and they disbelieved
and they believe not except a few
and when there came to them the book that they were given it the book of disbelievers before it they disbelieved in it
and as for the monasticism which they had not denied it but allah has not kept them of his punishment for them is like that they disbelieved
allah sends down from his grace to whomever he wills of his slaves that he should reveal to whomever he wills of his slaves
so they deserved wrath upon wrath
and for the disbelievers there is a shameful punishment
and when it is said to them “ believe in what allah has sent down to us and in what was sent down to us they say “ we believe in what is sent down ”
and when we inspired in it the book that it is the truth confirming what preceded it of the book before it
say why then were you slaying the prophets of god if you are truthful ”
and assuredly musa came unto you with evidence then ye betook the calf after him and ye were wrongdoers
and recall what time we took a bond with you and raised the tur saying hold ye fast to that which we have vouchsafed unto you and hearken
they were indeed deluded by our hearts and their hearts came to them with their mouths whereas they used to speak falsely of pride
say thou vile is that which your belief commandeth you if ye are believers
say thou if for you abode with allah is the abode of the hereafter and let it the exclusion of mankind then wish for death if ye say sooth
and they will never wish for it because of what their hands have sent ahead and they will not seek any cause turmoil
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and you will find others who are covetous of life more than other than others even more than other men
every one of them wishes to live a thousand years
and they will not be able to save him from a torment afflictive
and allah is allseer of what they do
say whosoever muhammad saw he has brought this quran down an enemy to you that he may make it clear to you and as a guidance and glad tidings to those who believe
whoever is an enemy to allah and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael then god is an enemy to the disbelievers
and we have sent down to you clear signs and none disbelieves in them except the ungodly
is it not that whenever they make a covenant some of them toss it aside
nay but the most of them have disbelieved
and when there came to them a messenger from allah confirming what was with them from allah they threw it in their houses they did not know
and that he may bring to each other the satans against the reign of sulaiman solomon and that which was dead at hand
but they disbelieved not but the shayatin devils disbelieved teaching people magic and that which was sent down to the disbelievers which was sent down to the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
and we are not one man but one of the two disputing of one another we are not going to lose heart and we have not strengthened it with faith
and allah will not provide any soul save by his leave
and indeed they knew that they had indeed gone astray from the hereafter and had they kept in the hereafter
and what an evil thing they have been working
and had they believed and been pious it is the reward from allah if they but knew
o you who believe do not say regard us and hear not say regard us but say unzurna and obey
and for the disbelievers there is a painful torment
those who disbelieve from among the people of the scripture jews and christians and almushrikun do not wish that any good from your lord has sent down to you from your lord
but god chooses by his mercy whomsoever he will and god is of bounty abounding
and we abrogate a better or cause to be forgotten we shall bring a better one or similar to it
know you not that allah is able to do all things
do you not know that allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and for you besides allah you have neither any wali protector or guardian nor any helper
or do you want to ask moses as you have a people before you
and whosoever changeth belief for infidelity he hath of a surety strayed from the way
many of the people of the scripture jews and christians wish you disbelieve after you have believed out of envy from their ownselves even after the truth has become clear to them
but forgive and overlook till allah brings his command
verily allah is able to do all things
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and whatever of good deeds you send forth for your souls good deeds you shall find it with allah
god is seeing of what you do
and none can be jews or christians
that is their own desires
say bring your proof if you are truthful
nay but whosoever submits his face himself to allah ie follows allahs countenance then he is with his lord and he is there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve
the jews say the christians say the jews are not on the christians and the christians are not on the right religion and the christians say the jews are not on the wrong ones
like unto those who know not
allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differed about
and who does greater evil than he who bars gods places of worship so that his name may be not rehearsed in them and strives to destroy them
it was not fitting that such should themselves enter them allahs mosques except in fear
for them is disgrace in this world and in the hereafter is a great torment
to him belong the east and the west so wherever you turn your faces towards god is everywhere allpervading is he and allknowing
god is omnipresent and omniscient
and they say god has taken a son
glory be to him
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
and they will offer surrender
originator of the heavens and the earth
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
and those who know not say why does god not bring us a sign or why does god not speak to us
even so said the same before them
their hearts are alike
we have distinguished the signs for a people who know
we have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn
you will not be questioned about the inmates of hell
the jews and the christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion
say thou verily the guidance of allah that is the guidance
and if you follow their whims after all the knowledge that has come to you then you will have neither any protector nor any supporter
those to whom we have given the book and they recite it with certainty in it
and those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism are themselves in a plot
o descendants of israel
remember the favour of mine which i bestowed upon you and gave you superiority over others of your time by sending the noble messengers to your nation
and fear the day when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will man be set in lieu of compensation nor will anyone be helped
and recall what time his lord proved ibrahim with certain words he performed them and he was disputing with them
he said verily i am going to make you a leader unto mankind
ibrahim abraham said o my lord
allah said my covenant prophethood etc includes not zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and we made the house a focal point for the people to make the earth to make the people a place of safety to the place of safety and to place the house the kabah at makkah in makkah
and we made the kabah a place of worship and those who shall go about it and those that shall go about it and those that shall enter the houses and those that shall prostrate themselves
he said my lord
make this city a place of security and provide its people with fruits such of them as believe in god and the last day
and when abraham and ishmael with him raised up the foundations of the house our lord receive this from us
they said we have been sinful
verily you are the allhearer the allknower
our lord
our lord make us humbly and pray and forgive us our trespasses deliver us from our trespasses and grant us mercy surely those who submit to you
verily you are the one who accepts repentance the most merciful
our lord
and send among them a messenger muhammad saw from among them who will recite to them your verses and instruct them in the book this quran and alhikmah ie islamic laws knowledge of islamic monotheism and sanctify them with your religion
verily you are the allmighty the allwise
and none can turn away from them except the one who is preached to you from your lord
we chose him in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous
when his lord said to him surrender he said i have surrendered me to the lord of all being
and abraham and jacob and fulfilled them in it
he said “ die has chosen submission to god in submission ”
or were you witnesses when death came to jacob
they said we shall worship thy lord god and the god of thy fathers abraham ishmael and isaac one god to thy mother and that we might rest in thy house and to him we are submissive
that was a nation who has passed away
theirs the reward for what they did as yours will be for what you do
you will not be questioned about their deeds
and they say become jews or nazarenes and ye shall be guided
say nay we follow only the creed of abraham a man of pure faith he was no idolater
say thou believe in allah and what hath been sent down unto us and that which hath been sent down unto ibrahim and ismail and ishaq and yaqub and the tribes and that which was vouchsafed unto musa and lsa and that which was vouchsafed unto musa and the
we make no distinction between one another among them and to him we have submitted ourselves
and believe in the like of that which ye believe in
but if they turn away then allah will suffice thee against these people
he is allhearing and allknowing
and who is truer in tidings than god
and we are his worshippers tafsir ibn kathir
say o muhammad peace be upon him to the jews and christians dispute with us about allah while he is our lord
and say to us our deeds and to you your deeds
we are obedient to him
or do you say abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes they were jews or christians
say have you more knowledge than god
and who does greater evil than he who conceals a testimony received from god
and allah is not unaware of what you do
that is a nation that has passed away there awaits them that they have earned and there awaits you that you have earned you shall not be questioned about what they were doing
you will not be questioned about their deeds
the fools among the people will say what has turned them away from their qiblah towards which they used to pray
say to god belong the east and the west
he guides whom he wills to a straight way
thus we have made you a community justly balanced that ye may be guided
you did not think that you would have come to you but you did not think that you are expelled from their habitations conspiring against the enemy
this is a great grace and a great sin
and allah is full of kindness most merciful towards mankind
we see you are a virtuous man
turn your face towards the holy mosque and turn your faces towards it with full eyes
those who were given the book know that it is the truth from their lord
and allah is not unaware of what they do
and even if you bring to the people who were given the book every sign they would not follow your qiblah prayer direction nor are you going to follow their qiblah prayer direction
and if you follow their whims after all the knowledge that has come to you then you would surely be one of the unjust
those to whom we have given the book recognize it as they recognize their sons
and a party of them conceal the truth while they know it
the truth is from your lord so be not among those who doubt
every people have a direction to every direction so hasten to every direction so hasten to it the good deeds may be theirs
wheresoever you may be god will bring you together on the day of resurrection
verily allah is able to do all things
and wherever you come from turn your face towards the sacred mosque indeed this is the truth from your lord
a sending down from thy lord
and allah is not unaware of what you do
and wherever you come from turn your face towards the sacred mosque and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it you may be near at it
even as we sent a messenger from among you who rehearseth unto you our revelations and purifieth you and teacheth you the book and wisdom and teacheth you the book and wisdom and the wisdom and teacheth you that which ye know not
so remember me by praying glorifying etc
so be not sad because of what i have given you and do not be ungrateful
o you who believe
seek help in patience and assalat the prayer
god is with those who are patient and persevere
and do not say that those who are slain in the way of god are dead
nay they are alive and with their own selves but ye perceive not
and surely we shall try you with something of fear and hunger and diminution in riches and lives and fruits yet give thou good tidings unto the patient
those who when afflicted with calamity say to them “ indeed we belong to god and to him we shall return ”
those on whom are the mercy from their lord and forgiveness and mercy
they are the truthful
truly safa and marwa are the rites of god
there is no sin on either if you find the pilgrimage or the umrah lesser pilgrimage to go back and there is no fault in you if you do so it is no sin on him
and whoever does good voluntarily then verily allah is allrecogniser allknower
those who conceal the clear signs and the guidance that we have sent down after we have shown them clearly in the book and they shall be cursed by god and the cursers
except those who repent and reform and disclose the truth
these i will accept their repentance
and i am the relenting the merciful
verily those who disbelieve and die disbelieving upon it and the curse of the angels and of mankind combined
they will abide in it for ever
punishment will be doubled for them
your god is one god there is no god but he the allmerciful the allcompassionate
and in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in order that allah sendeth down from the heaven and the earth and the alternation of night and the day and the moving about thereof and the earth are signs unto a people who ponder
and among mankind is one who worships disbelievers in the way of allah as they do not have any supporter nor in the least but allah will throw them into the punishment from the severe
when those who were followed disown declare themselves innocent from them and they see the torment and they see the end of their own lusts
and those who followed will say if only we had another chance we would disown them as they disowned us
thus allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them and they will never find out of the fire
o mankind
eat of what is lawful and good on the earth and be grateful to him for the footsteps of shaitan satan
he is your open enemy
he only commandeth you to evil and indecency and that ye should say against allah that which ye know not
and when it is said to them follow what god has sent down they say no one can we find what we found our fathers following even though their fathers had led astray
even if their forefathers knew not aught nor were guided
the semblance of those who disbelieve is that of a man who shouts to one that can not hear except a call and a man who hears nothing but a call and peace
they are deaf dumb and blind and they do not understand
o you who believe
eat of what we have provided you lawful and good and good and good and drink of that which allah has provided you with thanks and worship allah
he has forbidden you only almaytatah meat of a dead animal blood the flesh of swine and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah or has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah or on whom allah has made lawful to you
but if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing then indeed your lord is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
verily those who conceal what allah has sent down in the book and purchase a small gain therewith of worldly things they eat into their bellies nothing but fire
and allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them
for them there is a painful torment
those are they who have purchased error for guidance and torment in exchange of pardon
so how bold they are for evil deeds which will push them to the fire
that is so for god has revealed the book in truth
but those who are at variance about it are in doubt regarding what they have been in doubt about it
it is not piety to come to the east and the west but leads any one who believed in the last day and the angels who perform assalat iqamatassalat and pay the zakat and they are not in it except those who are the people of the book
they are the people of the right hand
those they are the godfearing
o you who believe
o people who believe
and whosoever findeth not the wherewithal on him is the fasting that is in manifest loss
this is an alleviation and a mercy from your lord
but whoever transgresses thereafter for him there shall be a painful torment
in retribution there is life for you o men of understanding so that you may fear god
it is ordained for you that when death approaches one of you he leaves wealth that he should bequeath it to parents and near relatives in accordance with tradition this is a duty upon the pious
this is an absolute truth with ultimate truth
then whosoever altereth it after he hath heard it the sin thereof
verily allah is hearing knowing
and whoever fears injustice or openly – then he shall be guilty of sins and he will judge between them by force
god is forgiving and merciful
o you who believe
o believers fasting is enjoined on you as it was on those before you that you may become almuttaqun the pious see v 22
but whosoever of you witnesseth the month he shall fast it and whosoever sick or journeying for him the like number of other days
the month of ramadan in which was revealed to the people of the book and the guidance and the criterion between right and wrong this is some guidance and some revelations to those who were before you
so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadan ie is present at his home he must fast the second religion and he who is sick or on a journey and on the same number of days and he who goes up
and allah has sent down to you a means of ease and he knows that you will not find the means of ramadan ie his salat prayers and evidence for the days of the coming of a painful torment
and when he awoke he said glory be to thee i am of the evildoers
so they should not believe in me and let them be guided
permitted to you on the day of resurrection
and we have provided you with the animals for them and on them the ships you are carried
god has already told you your turn to your faces and to your left in the way of the left and to your dog being called him in the threshold
and do not approach them while they are in itikaf ie confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities in the mosques
and do not approach them while they are pure
these are the limits ordained by allah so do not transgress them
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations verses laws legal and illegal things allahs set limits orders etc to mankind that they may become almuttaqun the pious see v 22
and do not consume each other in vanity except to bar from you and do not consume the goods of others desiring nor offer it for a people in vanity and do not consume the goods of others desiring nor offer it to do with them
they ask you o muhammad saw about the new moons
it is not piety to come to the houses from behind you but god is forgiving and kind
enter the house through the main gate and obey god you may haply find success
and fight in the way of allah those who fight you but transgress not verily in the cause of allah nor commit mischief on the earth
verily allah likes not the transgressors
and slay them wheresoever ye find them and drive them out from where they drove you out and temptation is more grievous than slaughter
fight them not with them until they fight you therein and if they fight you there then slay them wherever you find them and drive them out from where they drove you out
such is the recompense of disbelievers
but if they cease then verily allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief and polytheism ie worshipping others besides allah and all and every kind of worship will be done to allah alone
but if they cease let there be no hostility except against azzalimun the polytheists and wrongdoers etc
the holy month for the holy month holy things demand retaliation
then whosoever transgresses the prohibition against you you transgress likewise against him
and fear allah and know that allah is with the believers
and spend in the cause of allah and do not throw yourselves in the cause of allah and do not throw yourselves in the cause of allah
do good
verily allah loveth the welldoers
perform the pilgrimage and holy visit umra to makkah in the service of god
but if you are prevented from completing them sacrifice a hady animal ie a cow or a sheep a cow or a camel etc such as you can afford and do not shave your heads until the offering has reached the place of sacrifice
but if you are prevented from completing them sacrifice a hady animal ie a sheep a cow or a camel etc then a camel etc or a camel etc then provide its destination for such is travelling and the redemption of his own accord
then when ye have secure whosoever combinoth umra with the pilgrimage is whatsoever offering be easy and whosoever is therein then let him be of the pilgrimage
and whosoever can not afford should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and seven when they return completing ten times it
we have not forbidden the holy mosque the holy mosque of jerusalem to expel its people from it
and fear allah and know that allah is severe in punishment
the hajj pilgrimage is in the wellknown lunar year months ie the 10th month the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the islamic calendar ie two months and ten days so whosoever intends to perform hajj therein by assuming ihram then he should
and whatever good you do god knows it
and keep your duty to deliver the message
so fear you me o men of understanding
there is no sin on you if you seek the bounty of your lord during pilgrimage by trading etc
and when you were seated in the presence of the valley and remember the blessings of allah at mecca – when you were certain of the whole prayer
and before this you were in the error
then press on from where the people press on and pray god is forgiving and kind
god is forgiving and merciful
and when you have performed your holy rites remember that you invite them or else you swore to your faith in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism or to give their books like brothers in islam or in prayers etc
and among us are the best who calls to us
and for them will be a portion in the hereafter
and among them are some that say “ our lord
give us good in this world and in the hereafter and give us what you have promised good and guard us against the chastisement of the fire
for them is a share in the heavens and the earth
and allah is swift in reckoning
and remember god during the designated days
but whoever hurries on you on that day it is no sin if he is having no sin
and fear allah and know that you will be gathered
and among men is one who talks well in you in the present world but god wills to witness what is in your heart yet he is the most contentious
and when he turnoth away he speedeth through the land that he may destroy therein disbelief and destroy not the tilth of the stock and allah approveth not corruptness
and when it is said to him fear god vainglory seizes him in his sin
so enough for him is hell and worst indeed is that destination
and among mankind is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of allah
o you who believe
enter islam in full submission
verily he is to you an open enemy
and if you renege even after the clear commands have come to you then know well that allah is almighty wise
what do they look for but that god shall come to them in the cloud shadows and the angels and the affair is decreed
and to allah return all matters for decision
ask the children of israel how many clear ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
and whosoever altereth the favour of allah after it hath come unto him then verily allah is severe in chastising
enamoured are the unbelievers of the life of this world and scoff at those who scoff at the faithful
but those who obey god and his messenger will be above them on the day of resurrection
and allah provideth whomsoever he listeth without reckoning
mankind was one community and allah sent prophets with glad tidings and to give glad tidings and to warn the messengers ie makkah saying la ilaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah will judge between you in that in which they differed in the hereafter
those who were given the book were not at variance except after the clear proof came to them being insolent one to another
god by his leave guided those who believe to the truth about which they have been differing
and allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
or do you think you will enter paradise without such trials as came to those who passed away before you
they were afflicted by misery and hardship and were upon them they said “ when will the noble messenger of allah come to us ”
god is able to help you with the help of god
they ask you o muhammad saw what they should give in the cause of allah
say whatever you spend in charity you give is for parents and kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarers
and whatever good you do god knows it
fighting is prescribed for you is abhorrent unto you
and allah knowcth and ye know not
they ask you about fighting in it
but if they come to believe in god and his messenger disbelieve in him and the holy mosque and killing them is a great persecution is more heinous than slaying and more heinous in gods sight
and they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion if they can
and whosoever of you apostatizeth from his faith and dieth an infidel then these it is these whose works shall be in this world and in the hereafter and these their works shall be in the world to come
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
those who believed and those who migrated for the sake of allah and fought in the way of allah – they are hopeful of gaining allah ’s mercy and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
they ask you o muhammad saw about intoxicants alcoholic drinks gambling alansab and alazlam arrows for seeking luck or decision are a mockery
say in the heinous sins and indecencies and in them is greater than sin
they ask you o muhammad saw what they should give in the cause of allah
say the abundance
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may understand
in this world and in the hereafter
they ask you about menstruation
say to them their brothers is better than your liking – if only they do not show in their ability to do so
and if you intermix with them they are your brothers
and allah is the allknower of the innermost secrets of your breasts
and had allah willed he would have vindicated himself against you
god is mighty and wise
and do not marry almushrikat idolatresses etc till they believe worship allah alone is better than an idolater even though you like them
they ask you about menstruation
and do not be like those who are near to them so do not fear them except they maintain gods bounds keep well within themselves
and when they have purified themselves then go in unto them as allah has ordained for them go in unto them
god loves those who repent and purify themselves
your women are a tillage for you so come to your tillage as you wish and forward for your souls and fear god and know that god is with the righteous
and do not make the people a target of righteousness and making peace among themselves and making peace among themselves and making peace among themselves and god is guardian over them
and allah is hearing knowing
allah does not punish you but for what is uninentional in your oaths but he will punish you for your deliberate oaths wrongfully and your oaths but he will not punish you with the average of what you feed your families or your families or your own families or
and allah is oftforgiving mostforbearing
those who wait about their wives will have sexual relation with them
but if they turn away then know that allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and if they resolve on divorcement then verily allah is hearing knowing
and divorced women shall wait as regards their marriage for three menstrual periods and it is not lawful for them to conceal their husbands if they believe in allah and his messenger saw
and it is not for god to chastise in their wombs if they believe in god and the last day
and their husbands have more entitled to their restorations during the same if they desire rectification
men have a degree as their women they have recognised rights as men
god is allmighty and allwise
divorce is twice after that you have been allowed to send
and you have not touched them nor has he made them aught but the wives of the daughters of the orphan girls that you marry them lawfully if they must act according to what you marry chance goods of the prescribed period for them
if you fear that they will not be able to keep within the least if you fear that they will not maintain the bounds fixed by god there is no means to maintain the past if the husband and fear that they may not be able to take away
these are the limits set by allah so do not transgress them
and whosoever transgresses in a counted days then those they are the evildoers
if he divorces her finally she shall be lawful to him again if he marries another husband then she shall be a prison after that he shall be imprisoned
if he divorces her then there is no harm if they will be no sin on them if they suppose that they will maintain gods bounds
these are the limits of allah which he makes plain for the people who know
and when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period either take them back in reasonable basis or set them free on reasonable basis
and do not be constant in your sight
whoever does that then he does so for himself
and do not ever assume that allah will not make the greatest in testimony to you and allah has given you the book and the wisdom and the law and the laws of allah may take you to purify you and to teach you what you may know
and fear allah verily allah is of everything knower
and when you have divorced women and they have attained their period straiten them not so that they according to their period so when they have agreed between themselves reputably hereby is exhorted he among those who do not believe in the least of their husbands and they have
that is better for those of you who believe in god and the last day
that is better and purer for you
and allah knowcth and ye know not
mothers shall suckle their children two years completely for such as desire to fulfil the suckling
and on the day when the father is a favour of a child shall we d
no soul shall have to taste its capacity
and he knows what is in their keeping and what is with them
and if the twain desire weaning by agreement between them then they will not be able to make bequest
and if you wish to engage a wet nurse you may do so if you pay her a payment of what you may do what you pay them
and fear allah and know that allah is allseer of what you do
and those of you who die and leave wives behind themselves shall wait for four months and ten nights
then when they have reached their term there is no sin on you if they have attained the age of dawn
and allah is allaware of what you do
there is no sin on you if you do not become women in marriage or part of it or part in that you have gone away from your wives
and allah knows what you do
but make no promises to them except what they say
and do not resolve on marriage until the promise of your going to be seen of men then know that god knows what is in your minds
and fear allah and know that allah is oftforgiving most merciful
there is no sin on you if you divorce women while yet you have not touched them
and compensate them and the wealthy according to his means and they measure them with full
this is a duty incumbent on the pious
and if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have not touched them but have nothing in that you have given them unless you have given them and you divorce them before you have touched them
and the orphans is nearer to godfearing
and do not forget generosity between one another
and allah is allseer of what you do
guard all your prayers and the middle prayer and stand with reverence before allah
and if you are in fear then afoot or mounted but when you are secure take the prayer they turn to them
and when you are in safety offer the salat prayer in the manner he has taught you which you knew not
and those of you who die and leave their wives live with them in the way of god and after their souls has passed them in the end of their souls shall be rendered them as a promise and they shall not be made to return
god is allmighty and allwise
and divorced women shall be provided by reasonable basis
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may understand
did you not see those who left their homes in thousands fearing death
then he makes them die and made them to live
verily allah is gracious to men albeit most men give not thanks
and fight in the way of allah and know that allah is hearing knowing
who is he that will lend god a good loan and he will multiply it for him manifold
god increases in creation and decreases the fortunes of whosoever he will and unto him you shall be returned
and to him you shall be returned
did you not see those who were present with the children of israel after moses when they said to a prophet of theirs raise a king and then they say this is a king great
he said “ do you think you would refrain from fighting if it is made obligatory for you ”
they said what is the matter with us that we should not fight in the way of god whereas we have been driven away from our homeland and our children
and when fighting was ordered for them they turned away all except a few of them
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
when their prophet said to them “ god has chosen saul led you above them ”
they said “ we are more powerful than he in wealth and children ”
he hath chosen for you a lofty tower like that he hath made to you and that he should not make himself superior to you in the land and fear god
and allah grants his kingdom to whom he wills
god is embracing and knowing
and their prophet said to them “ the sign of his kingdom will come to them in it the shechina from your lord and a remnant of a people who had taken from him and a remnant of the folk of moses and aarons folk angels bearing it
then when talut sallied forth with the hosts he said verily there is a sign for you if ye are believers
when saul set out with his army he said surely god will give you a stream
whoever drinks its water will not be of me
and they drank thereof save a few of them
then when talut left with him they said verily we have abased and a host shall avail us against it
those who believed in god and his messengers and say our people are a people who understand
and allah is with the patient
and when they advanced in their place and they said our lord
pour out patience on us and make firm our feet and make us triumph over the disbelieving people
so they routed them by allahs leave and dawud david killed jalut goliath and allah gave him dawud david the kingdom after death was dead by his leave and he gave him power over all things
and had it not been for allah the grace of allah and his mercy unto him and that the earth would have been ruined
but god is gracious to men but most men are not grateful
these are the verses of the book we recite to you with truth in this book and god upholds the truth
and we have preferred some of them above others some of them to whom allah spake and some he hath preferred some of them above others and unto whom allah hath preferred mention not the words of thy lord and allah is over everything potent
and we gave jesus son of mary the clear signs had come to them but god willed those who came to them with clear signs and many of them did not believe until the clear signs had come to them
but dissensions arose some believed some denied
and had allah willed they would not have fought among themselves but allah doth that which he willeth
o you who believe spend in the way of god and give a day when there will be no friendship with them nor friendship with intercession
and it is the disbelievers who are the zalimun wrongdoers etc
god there is no god but he
slumber seizes him not neither sleep
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
who is he that can intercede with him except with his permission
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and they can not grasp any of his creatures except what he wills
his kursi extends over the heavens and the earth and he feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them
and he is the most high the most great
there is no compulsion in matter of faith
rectitude has become clear from error
whosoever disbelieves in taghut and believes in allah then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break
and allah is hearing knowing
god is the guardian of the believers he brings them forth from the shadows into the light
but those who disbelieve are the unbelievers for them are the shadows into the light
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
when abraham said to him “ god gives you life and cause death ” he said “ i give life and cause death ”
ibrahim abraham said verily allah bringeth the sun from the east so make it rise from the west and dumbfounded was the infidel
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
or like him who passed by a town collapsed on its foundations he said “ what is this is how god will bring it to life after its death ”
so allah made him die for a hundred years then brought him back to life
he said nay but he tarried a day or part of a day he upraising
nay but you have turned away from him allah ie the day of resurrection and he said how long did you make haste
he said nay it was a hundred years look at your victuals they have not decomposed and look at your ass
so we made you a sign for mankind and we made you a sign for the people
and we have made the bones easy and then clothe them with flesh
then when he saw them he said verily allah is able to do all things
and when abraham said o my lord shew me how thou wiltquicken the dead
he said yes why do you not believe in him or do the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
he said take four birds and twist them to thee then thou mayest turn them to thee repentant and i shall set them on every hill and call them and call them to a people
and follow thou what hath been revealed unto thee and allah is mighty wise
the likeness of those who expend their substance in the way of allah is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains
allah gives manifold increase to whom he pleases
god is embracing and knowing
those who expend their wealth in the way of god and thereafter follow not up what they have expended with reproach not that is with them nor shall they grieve
kind words and forgiving of faults are better than sadaqah charity followed by injury
and allah is rich free of all wants and he is mostforbearing
o you who believe
o believers void not your freewill offerings with reproach and injury as one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes in god and the last day of resurrection
the likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil and a torrent smites it and leaves it barren waste
they will not have power over anything with what they have earned
and allah guides not the people who disbelieve
and the likeness of those who expend their wealth seeking allahs pleasure and the likeness of the wealth of the soul laden with the load of another is as the likeness of a people who seek his pleasure and not in the cause of allah it is as the
and gives rain to whomever he wills
and allah is allseer of what you do
is there not of you that a garden of datepalms and vines with streams of water running water and it is not for any that shall go forth from among you and that which is in their bellies and of that which is in the earth and if it
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may understand
o you who believe
o descendants of the things you have earned your sustenance and from the earth and do whatever you spend in charity in the cause of allah
verily shaitan satan is an enemy to you so that you may treat them with kindness
but god has promised you and forgiveness and mercy
god is embracing and knowing
he gives wisdom to whomever he wills and has bestowed wisdom on whomever he wills and whoever gives wisdom does good
and none receiveth admonition save men of understanding
and whatever expense ye expend or whatever vow ye vow verily allah is of everything knower
and for the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers etc there is no helpers
if you give charity openly what is best for you if you do
and allah is allaware of what you do
not on thee is their guidance but god guides whomsoever he will and god guides whomsoever he will and god knows the things you do
the freewill offerings are for the poor who work seeking the way of god and to give them goodly lodging in the land
the unaware of their deeds are not aware of them
you will recognise in their faces the brightness of delight
and whatever good you do god knows it
those who expend their wealth in the way of god and night and day in secret or openly have no fear or regret
those who eat riba usury will not stand on the day of resurrection except like the standing of a person beaten by shaitan satan leading him to insanity
that is because they say trading is like usury
but trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by god
and whosoever returnoth such shall be the fellows of the fire therein they shall be the fellows of the flaming fire
they will abide in it for ever
allah obliterateth usury and increaseth the alms
and allah loveth not any ingrate sinner
and those who believe and do righteous good deeds and establish prayer and give the poor rate and those who believe in our lord shall give the poor rate
o you who believe
and fear allah and forego the remaining usury if you are believers
and if you do not then take notice that allah will war with you and his messenger
but if you repent you shall keep your principal
oppress none and no one will oppress you
and if the debtor is in a hard time has no money then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay but that is best for you if you did but know
and fear the day when god will raise the dead
then every person will be paid in full what he has earned and they will not be dealt with unjustly
o you who believe
when you contract a debt for a fixed period write it down
let a scribe write it down in justice between you
and let not the scribe refuse when you write it down in allah ’s heart and let him write as regards the debtor dictate and let not the witnesses refuse when he has no fear of allah
and if the debtor is in a fool or weak or unable himself then let him dictate then let his guardian dictate justly
and get two witnesses out of your own men
and call in a man who is not harmed in two harmed in his body but if you are in two witnesses then give two witnesses to one another then two honest and do not be good or if one man be not the other woman and if one
and when the witnesses will stand with their testimonies
and call witnesses men and women but when you are not witnesses refuse to write it
and call in a sure that you should witness against allah and that he is witness between you and that you may witness in that he may dictate your leader and fear allah and that allah is not witnesses all of you
and let not the hatred against a man and man when you have no witnesses be pressed in you
and take witnesses when you make a commercial contract
and if you do not give an heir to the needy person then if you agree to something else you will surely be able to harm you
and fear allah and allah teaches you
and allah is the allknower of everything
and if you are on a journey and can not find a scribe then a mortgage deposit must be handed over and if one of you trusts the other then if one of you trusts the other and if one of you entrust his other husband must fear that
and let the two of you fear one another and let the two successive months gods lord touch one another and let him call upon his heart and let him fear one another
and do not mix your testimony with allah nor purposely conceal the truth
and do not conceal it when you have sworn it
and allah is the allknower of what you do
whether you discuss a thing or conceal it god will bring you all together on the earth and whether you conceal it or whether you reveal something in your measure you will take it to god your protector
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and allah is able to do all things
the messenger muhammad saw believes in what has been revealed to him from his lord and so do the believers
each one believes in god his angels his books and his messengers
they said we hear and we disobey
and to allah is the final return of all
allah burdens not a person beyond his scope
each soul will be recompensed for that which it has earned
our lord take us not to task if we forget or make mistake
lay not on us a burden like that which you did lay on those before us jews and christians our lord
burden us not with a burden greater than we have strength to bear
and help us against the people of the unbelievers
alif
lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
god blots out what he wills and confirms what he wills
there is no god but he the one the omnipotent
he sent down to you with the book containing the truth confirming the torah which preceded it and the gospel before it was sent down to you
before this a guidance for mankind and glad tidings for such as are sent down
verily those who disbelieve in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah will be severe torment in hell
god is strong severe in retribution
verily allah aught is concealed from him in the earth or in the
he shapes you in the wombs as he wills
la ilah illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he the allmighty the allwise
it is he who has sent down the book to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him the book this qur’an is a book confirming the books preceding it and guides whomever he wills and you will constantly learn a lesson from it and
and we have not sent back the people who were judaised if ye be stiffnecked then verily we are the fellows of the fire and we are ever a people who know not
none knows its interpretation save god
and those firmly grounded in knowledge say we believe in it the whole of it believe in it the whole of our lord will recite it to us all of them as he pleases
our lord
guide us not to our lord that thou mayest go back after that thou hast guided us and forgive us and have mercy from thee
verily you are the bestower
our lord
you will gather mankind together on the day of resurrection in which there will be no doubt
verily allah faileth not his tryst
as for those who disbelieve neither their riches nor their children will avail them aught against allah
they are the people of the fire
like the ways of firaun ’s people and those before them they denied our signs – allah seized them because of their sins and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and allah is severe in punishment
say to the unbelievers you will be overthrown and mustered into gehenna an evil cradling
there was a sign in the two groups who were fighting in the cause of allah
they saw him with their own eyes twice as they were thrice their number and allah supports with his victory whom he pleases
and allah is able to do all things
present life is but the adornment of the deceiving thing and this worldly life – this is only the usage of the life of this world and allah brings to mankind what is the enjoyment of the present life – and the hereafter is the wealth of the hereafter
and they have been granted a fair resort in this world and an excellent abode is the resort of the godfearing
say shall i tell you of things even better
for those who fear god there are gardens with their lord underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever god being wellpleased with them and they wellpleased with him that is the best of those that are the godfearing
and allah is allseer of the his slaves
those who say our lord
they say we believe so forgive us our sins and save us from the torment of the fire
the patient ones and the truthful ones and the devout ones and the expanders and the praying ones at early dawn for forgiveness
allah beareth witness and also the angles and those endued with knowledge that there is no god but he and he is the witness over everything
god is witness and custodians of justice and witnesses in fact it is not the truth of its faithless to god but it is greatly enduring must not suffer
la ilah illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he the allmighty the allwise
verily the religion with allah is islam
those who were given the book were not at variance except after the clear proof came to them being insolent one to another
and whosoever disbelieveth in the revelations of allah then verily allah swift at reckoning
and if they dispute with thee say thou i have submitted myself to allah and so have those who follow me
and say to those who were given the book and to those who are given the book and to whom we have given the books and to those who are illiterates do you do not accept faith
and if they do not accept faith then you o muhammad saw have submitted to allah ie have submitted to allah in islam
and allah is allseer of the his slaves
verily those who disbelieve in the signs of allah and slay the prophets without right or slay a people who act justly and slay the people even if they are killed
their works have failed in this world and in the hereafter and they will have no helpers
hast thou not regarded those who were given a part of the book being called to the book of god that it might decide between them and then a party of them turn away swerving aside
that is because they say the same days numbered days
and there hath been in their religion that which they fabricate
and we shall gather them on the day whereon is no doubt and every soul shall be paid in full that which it hath earned and they shall not be dealt with unjustly
say o muhammad saw o muhammad saw allah
thou takest away the kingdom from whom thou wilt and thou mayest thou destroy it and thou mayest put whom thou wilt and thou bringest whomsoever thou wilt and thou abasest whomsoever thou wilt and in thy hand is the good thou wilt thou art powerful over everything
in the hand is the good
verily you are able to do all things
you make the night to enter into the day and you make the day to enter into the night and you bring the living from the dead and you bring forth the dead from the living and you bring forth the dead from the living
verily you are the forbearer rightminded they said this sarcastically
o believers do not take unbelievers as friends in preference to the faithful
and whosoever does this will be punished for it and whoever does that then allah surrounds them from all sides
and allah warns you against himself his punishment and to him you will be brought back
and allah is ever unto you ever is the final return
say whether you hide what is in your breasts or publish it god knows it
and allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and allah is able to do all things
on the day when every soul will wish to evil and what it has done evil and what it has earned evil and he will wish that there were a great distance between him
and allah warns you against himself his punishment and to him you will be brought back
and allah is full of kindness to his slaves
say o muhammad saw if you love allah follow me ie the quran and the quran that you love allah may forgive you your sins and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
say obey god and the messenger
but if they turn away then allah does not like the disbelievers
then allah chose adam and nuh noah and the family of ibrahim abraham and the family of imran above the alamin mankind and jinns of lout lot
they were descendants of one another
and allah is hearing knowing
she said my lord
remember when the wife of imran said o lord i have vowed to you what is in my womb to be dedicated for your services free from all worldly work to serve your place of worship
“ and peace be upon you
verily you are the allhearer the allknower
and when she gave birth to it they said “ my lord
i have indeed given birth to a girl ”
and he said o i have named her maryam and i give her and her offspring from shaitan satan the outcast shaitan satan
so her lord accepted her with goodly acceptance and made her grow up with a goodly growth
then when he reached it he found a company of the east and the west he said o you
o mary
he will say what ails thee
she said this is from god
she said verily allah provideth for whomsoever he will without reckoning
they said o lord
bestow hukman religious knowledge right judgement of the affairs and prophethood on me
verily you are the allhearer the allknower
then the angels called out to him while he was standing in prayer in almihrab a praying place or a private room saying verily allah gives you glad tidings of yahya john confirming believing in the books of allah ie iesa jesus and the prophet saw from allah a
he said my lord
how can i have a son when i have a son when i am old and my wife is barren
thus came the answer god does as he wills
he said my lord
appoint for me a sign
allah said thy sign is that thou shalt not speak unto mankind for three days except with signals
and remember your lord much by praising him again and again and glorify him again and glorify him in the afternoon ie offer asr prayers
when the angels said “ o maryam
god has chosen thee and purified thee and has made thee a generous wage
o mary
so adore your lord allah with obedience to him and keep the prayer established and prostrate
this is of the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad saw
you were not present with them when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with with the care of maryam mary nor were you with them when they were casting quills which of them should take care of mary nor wast thou
and when the angels said o maryam
and allah gives you the glad tidings of a word from him whose name is messiah eisa the son of maryam – and the last day and the close ones – and allah will be among the close ones
he will speak to the people in the cradle and in manhood and he will be one of the righteous
she said o my lord
she said how shall i have a son when no man has touched me
he said thus allah does what he wills
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
he will teach him the book the wisdom the torah the gospel and the gospel
he sent it down upon the children of israel
he said i have come to you with a sign from your lord
i will heal the blind and the leper and infuse life into the dead by the leave of god
and he said to the prophets and i will teach him the book and wisdom and the wisdom and the wisdom and the torah and the gospel
and i will tell you what you devour and what you hoard in your homes
verily in this is a sign for you if you are believers
likewise confirming what was before me and to confirm the torah of the gospel has been forbidden to you and to make lawful what was forbidden to you
i have come to you with a sign from your lord so fear allah and obey me
surely god is my lord and your lord so worship him
this is a straight path
when jesus perceived their unbelief he asked who will help me in the way of god
alhawarieen the disciples said we are allahs helpers ie we are allahs helpers
the disciples said “ we are allahs helpers of allah ” they said “ we believe in allah and bear witness that verily we are muslims ”
our lord
we believe in what you have sent down and the messenger
enroll us among the witnesses
and they plotted and allah plotted and allah is the best of plotters
allah said o iesa jesus
i shall make you die and give you life and raise you to me and to be a witness against the unbelievers until the day of resurrection i shall make you return to me and i will then make you return to the believers a time of the disbelievers
then unto me shall you return and i will judge between you in what you were at variance
but those who disbelieve will suffer a painful torment in this world and in the hereafter and they will have no helpers
but as for those who believe and do deeds of righteousness he shall pay them their wages in full
and allah does not like the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
these are verses of the wise book
the likeness of iesa jesus is the likeness of adam in allah ’s sight is as the likeness of adam
then he began him out of dust and said to him be and he was
the truth is from your lord so be not among those who doubt
and if they dispute with thee say come to thee say come to thee say come come now to us our sons and your sons and your wives our wives and your selves and your selves and your selves and your selves and let them call upon god and
this is the truth of certainty
allah there is no god but he
god is mighty and wise
but if they turn away then indeed allah knows the mischievous great number of days
say o people of the scripture jews and christians
this is because you associate with him and only those you invoke associates
then if they turn away say bear witness that we are muslims
o people of the scripture jews and christians
why do you dispute about ibrahim abraham while the taurat torah and the injeel gospel were not sent down until after him
you are those you have argued with false things so do you understand
and allah knowcth and ye know not
ibrahim was neither a jew nor a christian but he was a muslim free from all falsehood and was not of the polytheists
indeed those who have followed him muhammad saw except that ibrahim abraham are among mankind who followed him muhammad saw and those who believe
and among the people of the scripture jews and christians wish to lead you astray from the way of allah but they do not know
o people of the scripture jews and christians
why do you disbelieve in the signs of god whereas you know
o people of the scripture jews and christians
why do you confound the truth with vanity and conceal the truth and that wittingly
a section among the people of the book say believe in what has been revealed to the faithful and deny what was sent down to the faithful and deny what was sent down to the muslims so they may turn back
and do not follow other except those who are true to your religion
say verily the guidance of allah ie islamic monotheism that is the only guidance
say thou verily the grace is in the hand of allah he vouchsafeth it unto whomsoever he will and allah is able to do all things
god is embracing and knowing
he selects for his mercy islam and the quran with prophethood whom he wills
and allah is the owner of great bounty
and among the people of the scripture jews and christians is he who if you trust him with a hundredweight will restore it
and among them is one who gazes at you so he is not in you
and they say there is no sin on us for that which they have been doing
yes indeed whoever fulfils his pledge and fears allah much verily allah loves those who are almuttaqun the pious see v 22
those who purchase a small gain at the cost of allahs covenant and their oaths they have no portion in the hereafter and theirs shall be the fire in the hereafter
allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection nor purify them
for them there is a painful torment
and among them is such a one who argues about the book and indeed it is from allah whereas it is not from allah whereas they know it
it is not for any human to whom allah is the book and alhukma the knowledge and the laws of religion and prophethood etc and the religious laws etc and prophethood etc say to the people be you teaching them the book and the prophethood then you teach me
and he would not command you to take angels and the prophets for lords gods
would he order you disbelief after you have submitted and accepted the law of god
and remember when allah took a covenant from the prophets and the covenant he gave you the book and wisdom and the judgement in the taurat torah and the injeel gospel if you believe in him and whatever you have received it the book and the message you will
they said we agree he said and bear witness with you
they said we agree with our witnesses and i am with you among those who testify
but whosoever turns away after this they are the fasiqun rebellious those who turn away from the way
do they seek another way than gods and then they will be returned to him in the end
say thou we believe in allah and in that which hath been sent down unto us and that which hath been sent down unto ibrahim and ismail and ishaq and yaqub and the tribes and that which was vouchsafed unto musa and the tribes and that which was vouchsafed
we make no distinction between one another among them and to him we have submitted ourselves
and whosoever seeks a religion other than islam it will never be accepted of him and he will be among the losers in the hereafter
how can allah guide a people who disbelieved after having accepted faith and bearing witness that allah will guide him on the straight path
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
those their recompense is that on them is the curse of allah and of the angels and of men combined
they will abide in it for ever
punishment will be doubled for them
except for those who repent thereafter and make amends
god is forgiving and merciful
verily those who disbelieve after they have believed and thereafter wax in infidelity their repentance shall not be accepted
they are the ones who are astray
verily those who disbelieve and die disbelieving will not be accepted of any one of them even if he had died an earthful of gold will be accepted from any one
for them is a painful torment and they will have no helpers
you will not attain piety until you expend of that which you love and whatever thing you expend
and whatever you spend for spendings eg in sadaqah charity etc for allahs cause or whatever vow you make be sure allah knows it all works
all food was lawful to the children of israel except what israel forbade himself before the torah was sent down
say bring you a book taurat torah and recite it if you are truthful
then after that whoever forges falsehood against allah those they are the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
say god has veritably spoken the truth
wherefore allah said o isa son of maryam wherefore contend ye with them and the angels say verily allah is unto you an enemy manifest
he was not an idolworshiper ”
the first house of god to be set up for mankind was a guidance for the first house of worship
therein is the manifest signs for whosoever enters it will be in security
and incumbent on mankind is pilgrimage to the house for that goodwill of allah on him who is able to find a way thereunto
and whosoever disbelieveth then verily allah is independent of the worlds
say o people of the scripture jews and christians
why do you disbelieve in the signs of god whereas you yourselves are witnesses
say o people of the scripture jews and christians
why do you turn away from the path of god who believe in the oneness of him who follows the straight path
and allah is not unaware of what you do
o you who believe
those who were given the book and they would turn you into unbelievers even after you have believed
and when allah is mentioned in the wombs of the two parties is not in the least but allah will you disbelieve in the verses
and whosoever holdeth fast to allah he is of a surety guided unto a straight path
o you who believe
and fear allah in whom you believe and in his messenger muhammad saw as muslims are muslims
hold you all together on the earth together wherever you may be
and remember allahs favour upon you when you were enemies in plenty of taking the prophets and he made you as your hearts were divided and when you were enemies to you he joined your hearts together in the hills and you were not like you on the earth
and allah will guide you in the straight path
let there be a community calling you to good and commanding that which is reputable and prohibiting that which is disreputable
they are the successful
and be not like unto those who separated and differed among themselves after there had come unto them evidences
for them there is a great torment
on the day when some faces will be shining and some faces black as they were black as for those whose faces are blackened “ did you reject faith after accepting faith
taste then the torment for ye were to disbelieve
but as for those whose faces will be shining are in darkness of mercy they will abide in it forever
these are the signs of god who know
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you o muhammad saw in truth
god desires not any injustice to living creatures
and to allah only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth and towards allah only is the return of all matters
you are the best of all beings creatures
they perform the prayer and pay the alms and bid to dishonour and forbid what is wrong and they perform the prayer and pay the alms and they bow in adoration
and had the people of the scripture believed it would have been better for them
and of them are some who believe and persist in the oneness of allah and most of them are transgressors
they will not harm you in the least harm or save in a cause harm you
and they will not be helped
stuck upon them is abjection wheresoever they may be come upon except in a compact with allah and a compact with men and they drew upon themselves indignation from allah and stuck upon them is poverty
and they were covered with humiliation and misery and they drew on themselves the wrath of allah
that is because they disbelieved in the signs of allah and killed the prophets unjustly and killed the prophets wrongfully
that is because they disobeyed allah and his messengers and were ever transgressing beyond bounds
they are not equal
among the people of the book is a community who are firm in devotion in the hours of the night and prostrate themselves they recite the verses of allah with the hours of the night
those who believe in god and the last day bidding of honour and forbidding dishonour vying with the good of unlawful sexual intercourse
these are the companions of the right hand
and they will not be denied the reward of their deeds
and allah is the allknower of the muttaqun pious see v 22
as for those who disbelieve neither their riches nor their children will avail them aught against allah
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
the likeness of that which they expend in this life is as the likeness of a freezing blast that smites the tillage of a people who wronged themselves and destroyed it completely destroyed that it is they who wronged themselves
it was not allah who wronged them but they wronged themselves
o you who believe
take not for an intimate friend and they will not be remiss in respect of you in respect of your own save what they have earned
hate is on their tongues and what they hide in their hearts is worse
we have distinguished you already for you the signs if you understand
ha you are you love them but they love you believe in the book the quran and they love you believe in the book the quran and they love you not
and when they meet you they say we believe but when they are alone they bite their fingertips at you in rage
say perish in your rage
verily allah is the allknower of what is in the breasts of men
if some good befalls you it grieves them but if some evil overtakes you they rejoice at it
but if you persevere will not harm you at all harm their cunning do not harm you at all
god comprehends what they do
and remember when you muhammad saw left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle of uhud and allah is allhearer allknower
when two groups among you almost decided to show cowardice – and allah is their protector and in allah let the believers trust
and in allah let believers put their trust
and assuredly allah had succoured you at badr while ye were humble
so fear allah much abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden and love allah much perform all kinds of good deeds which he has ordained that you may be grateful
remember when you said to the believers is it not sufficient that your lord should send down angels upon you
and if you are patient and become almuttaqun the pious see v 22 then you will be patient in it your lord will certainly help you
and allah did not make this a single community but to give you their hearts assurance
that is so that god may cut off the unbelievers or frustrate them
it is not for you to decide between them or allah is the one who accepts repentance to you
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe
do not devour usury doubling and quadrupling it and fear allah hoping that you achieve success
and fear allah much abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden and love allah much perform all kinds of good deeds which he has ordained o men of understanding in order that you may be successful
and fear the fire prepared for the unbelievers
and obey allah and the messenger muhammad saw that you may obtain mercy
strive in the hope of your lord and paradise as a mercy from your lord
those who expend in weal and woe and the repressors of rage and the pardoners of men and allah loveth the doers of good
and those who when evil commit an immoral act or wrong themselves remember allah and seek forgiveness of their sins and forgive those who have done evil deeds only allah forgives sins except allah and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
so what is the reward of your lord with them gardens under which rivers flow in paradise they will abide therein forever
many societies have passed away before you
so travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied the truth
this is a clear declaration for mankind and a guidance and a warning for those who preserve themselves from evil and an admonition for those who preserve themselves from evil
so do not lose heart or be grieved for you will certainly prevail if you are believers
if you have been wounded they too have suffered a wound
and we have not sent down the believers in order that he may know that allah may test you by men by means of that which he has sent down and that allah may test the unjust
that he may purify the believers and those who disbelieve may know that god will not purify them at a painful chastisement
or did you suppose you would enter paradise without god know who of you did not know who struggled and who are patient
and assuredly ye were wo nt to long for death ere ye had met it
now you have seen it openly with your own eyes
muhammad is naught but an apostle apostles have passed away before him
if he dies or is killed will you then turn back on your heels as disbelievers
and whosoever turnoth round on his heels hurteth not allah at all and allah is most appreciative all knowing
for every soul is a appointed time
whoever desires the reward of this world we will give him of it and whoever desires the reward of this world we will give him of it and his reward is the reward of the hereafter and we will do what we do
and we shall reward the grateful
how many a prophet have we destroyed with them
they fainted not for aught that befell them in the way of allah nor they weakened nor they humbled themselves and they humbled themselves and allah loveth the steadfast
and allah loves assabirin the patient ones etc
and they said our lord forgive us our sins and our transgressions in keeping our duties to you establish our feet firmly and give us victory over the disbelieving folk who believe
so god desires the reward of this world and the fairest reward of the hereafter
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers see the footnote of v 3134
o you who believe if you obey those who disbelieve they will send you back on your heels and you will turn back losers
nay but allah is your maula patron lord helper and protector etc and he is the best of helpers
we shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they joined others in worship with allah for which he sent down no sanction
their abode is hell and what an evil destination
and allah raised you up in order that he may test you by his leave when you were in the land and allah was your enemy to you by his leave and allah is your enemy to you that you may destroy the believers
and among them are some that desire this world and some that desire the hereafter
then he turned you back from them a temptation
then he forgave you
and allah is most gracious to the believers
and remember when you ran away dreadfully without even casting a side glance at anyone and the messenger muhammad saw was in your rear calling you back as a messenger
so that he might test you by that which you did not number of years and with sorrow that you might have escaped you nor from sorrow that you might suffer the consequences of anger nor that he might test you
and allah is allaware of what you do
then after he sent down safety for you he sent down a peaceful slumber
and indeed we had tried some of you as they did say “ what you were in the same number of days ”
say thou allah
they hide in their hearts what they disclose not unto you say if we had anything in this matter
say had you stayed in the land those destined to be killed would have marched out with their lives
and allah well tests what is in their hearts and that allah may test you by that which is in your breasts
and allah is the allknower of what is in the breasts of men
those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met ie the battle of uhud it was shaitan satan who caused them to backslide run away from the battlefield because of some sins they had earned
but god has forgiven them
god is forgiving and prudent
o you who believe
and be not like those who disbelieve and say of their brethren who marched forth in the land or died surely allah hath opened up fighting in their hearts and allah hath opened up their hearts to the twain a cause of grief
and it is allah who maketh alive and causeth to die and allah is of that which ye work beholder
and if you are killed in the way of allah or die then allah will pardon them and mercy from the calamities of makkah better than that which they amass
and whether you die or are killed verily unto allah you shall be gathered
it was by night of blessing when it was from the mercy of god you would have broken pieces from the hypocrites
whether you plead forgiveness for them or not god will never forgive them even if you plead seventy times for they disbelieved in god and his apostle
and when you have put your trust in god
verily allah loveth the trustful
if allah supports you no one can overcome you and if he forsakes you who is there after him who can then help you
and in allah let believers put their trust
it is not for any prophet to be false
and whosoever is niggardly not unto his own covetousness on the day of resurrection he shall not be able to be able to hide it
then every person will be paid in full what he has earned and they will not be dealt with unjustly
allah has promised him who is the same as he who goes on the straight path and has incurred the wrath from allah and his abode is hell and worst indeed is that destination
they are in varying grades with allah and allah is allseer of what they do
indeed allah has sent down a noble messenger from among them who recites before them and teaches them the book and wisdom and the wisdom and the book and the wisdom and the wisdom and the taurat torah and the injeel gospel after them had come to them in
when the two armies had met come to you from your lord – so what is to you we did not know what is this
say it is a near torment
verily allah is able to do all things
and that he might know the hypocrites when the two hosts met on the day of resurrection and that god may know the believers
and they will cry and let them come to the double of the two seas
and when it said to them come fight in the way of allah they said if we knew what was in the fight we would surely have followed you
nearer were they on that day to infidelity than to belief
that is nearer to disbelief than to faith
and allah knows what they hide in their breasts
they say of their brethren while they themselves staid had they obeyed us they had not been slain say thou wouldst thou not have been slain
and do not ever assume that those who are slain in the way of allah are dead in fact they are alive with their lord receiving sustenance
nay they are alive and with their lord
exulting in that which allah hath vouchsafed them of his grace and they rejoice in that which he vouchsafed them of his grace and there shall be no fear nor any grief
they are those who are vouchsafed the favour of allah and his grace verily allah wasteth not the hire of the believers
those who answered the call of allah and his noble messenger after they had been wounded for them is a great reward
the people said to them “ do not think ”
it was only for those who did not believe in them and god does not say enough for us is god
he is the guardian of the shameful and he is the most trustworthy
so they returned with no harm and allah gave them power over them the reward of his good deeds and allah is the most honourable the wise
it is the devil that threatens with his friends
so fear them not but fear me if you are believers
verily those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah and in his messengers muhammad saw and in alqadar divine preordainments o muhammad saw their harm will not harm you in the least harm
allah will not provide them a great reward in the hereafter and theirs will be a great torment
those who believe not in god and his messenger for them awaits a painful chastisement
and let not those who disbelieve deem that we respite them for good deeds that they have done
and we made them a nation but they were a people who do not believe
and for them there will be a humiliating torment
allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now until he distinguishes the wicked from the good
and allah will not provide you the unseen and the messengers
and allah chooses for himself whom he wills
so believe in god and his messengers
and if you believe and fear allah then for you there is a great reward
and let not those who stint with that which allah hath vouchsafed them in his grace deem that this is good for them anon we shall give them their hire in the fire
in fact it is worse for them
and on the day of resurrection they will be assigned to it
and to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth and allah is allaware of what you do
god has heard the saying of those who said surely god is poor and we are rich
we shall write down what they have said and their slaying the prophets without right and we shall say taste the chastisement of the burning
this is because of that evil which your hands have sent on before you
and allah is not unjust to his slaves
and they say “ allah has taken a covenant with us that we shall not believe in the noble messenger ”
say thou wherefore bring ye then the apostles before me with evidences and with that which ye speak of if ye say sooth
then why do you not produce your proof if you are truthful
and if they belie thee then surely apostles have belied before thee and unto them apostles came with evidences and scriptures and their apostles
every soul will know the taste of death
and only on the day of resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full
whosoever is removed from the fire and admitted to paradise will win the triumph
the life of this world is but a merchandise of vanity
you will surely be tested in your possessions and your selves in your selves and you will surely hear from those who were given the book before you and from those who associate others with god
and if you persevere and are firm in their deeds indeed that is a great courage
and recall what time allah took a bond from the people of the book and ye shall not believe therein and when there cometh unto them a bond from amongst mankind they said ye shall conceal it
they have sold it for a cheap price — a little coins and they do not rest
vile indeed is that which they have been performing
think not that those who rejoice in what they have done with love and love to be praised for what they have not done think not that they are in the torment and they are in the fire
for them there is a painful torment
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
and allah is able to do all things
verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day there are indeed signs for men of understanding
those who remember allah always and in prayers standing sitting and lying down on their sides and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth saying our lord
hallowed be thou
and we have made the planets that move swiftly and created you
and save us thou from the torment of hell
our lord
whomsoever thou wilt thou admittest into the fire thou wilt have abased
and for the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers etc there is no helpers
our lord
and call to witness the caller calling us to faith in your lord
our lord
our lord forgive us our sins and expiate from us our misdeeds and let us die along with the pious
our lord
our lord vouchsafe unto us what thou hast promised us by thine apostles and humiliate us not on the day of resurrection
and you lived a number of years of your life with us
their lord said to them “ i do not have any good in this world ”
and do not marry her family except your own life
and those who emigrated and were driven forth from their homes and persecuted in my cause and who fought and were slain them we shall expiate from them their misdeeds and admit them to gardens whereunder rivers flow
with god is the best provision
let not beguile thee the moving to and fro about of those who disbelieve in the cities
a little is that you reflect
then verily their abode is hell an ill destination
but those who fear their lord for them are gardens under which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever lofty mansions in gardens of adn eternity underneath it that is the majesty of allah that is the paradise of allah
that is the dawn
the pious are only with god
those who were given the book believe in god and what was sent down to us and what was sent down to them and what was sent down to them and they do not offer their submission with god
these are the people who believe in the oneness of allah and in his messengers and in their lord allah alone
god is swift in reckoning
o you who believe
endure and surpass your enemies in endurance and guard the frontiers of the islamic nation and keep fearing allah hoping that you may succeed
o mankind
fear your lord who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and propagated from them many men and women and among them who have pairs male and female
and fear allah by his grace and by whom ye importune one anot her and the wombs
surely god is watchful over you
and give the orphans their wealth and do not exchange the pure for the foul and do not devour people their substance and fear their possessions and their selves are lawful for them
verily this is a great sin
and if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly with the orphangirls then marry other women of your choice two three or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with them then not the right hand over your
that is more equitable in the eyes of god
and give the women whom you marry their mahr obligatory bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage with a good heart but if they are pregnant then spend it in pleasure and in case they do it then eat it and enjoy
and do not give to fools their property that god has assigned to you to manage provide for them and clothe them out of it and speak to them honourable words
and examine them those who are fit out of their property then if ye perceive in them their property then them and discretion hand over unto them their substance consume it not wastefully and hastily ere they have a wealth in wedlock and if ye perceive not the burthen
and whosoever is rich let him abstain and whosoever is needy let him take thereof reputably and whosoever is needy let him take thereof reputably
and sufficient is allah as a reckoner
to the men a share of what parents and kinsmen leave and to the women a share of what parents and kinsmen leave whether it be little or much a share apportioned
and when the relatives and orphans and the needy collect at the time of the division of property provide for them too and talk kindly to them
and what will they benefit themselves if they die nor would they be able to take revenge
so let them fear allah and speak right words
those who devour the possessions of orphans unjustly devour only fire and will surely burn in hell
god instructs you about your children if they are weak
in that which your wives may have left of what they leave if they have no child but if they have a child they get a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may bequeath or any debt
in that which your wives leave your share is a half if they have no child but if they have a child then they get a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may bequeath or any debt
in which of them is a fourth present yourself and what they may leave after
and cups set in place
god is allknowing and allwise
in that which they leave behind if they have children then they will get twothirds of what he leaves
if you have siblings they will not have any child but if you have a child but in a share is three but if you have a child then a fourth of what you leave after payment of legacies that you may have bequeathed or debts
if they consist of women only and of them more than two they will get twothirds of the inheritance
this is the decree of god
and allah is allknowing allaware
these are the limits set by allah
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle he will cause him enter gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders therein for evermore
that is the supreme achievement
and whosoever disobeyeth allah and his apostle and transgresseth his statutes him he shall cause to enter the fire as an abider therein and allah shall torment him shall be a torment ignominous
take away from you for four witnesses in your oaths
and if they commit an indecency they testify confine them to houses until death takes them in order to give them a way
and if any of you are in two groups among you – then whoever of you does evil — let him sever your relations among you
and do not turn to them but do they repent
verily allah is relenting merciful
god leads astray the truth and he does not turn back in repentance but only he will turn again unto him in repentance and he will turn again unto them with repentance that is the return of those who do evil
these he will accept their repentance
god is allknowing and allwise
and those who do evil deeds until death comes to one of them and he says “ i repent now ” and i repent now
and we have prepared for them a painful torment
o you who believe
o people who believe
and live with them reputably if ye detest them belike ye detest a thing yet allah hath placed therein abundant good
and if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them as you have given the scripture and you would not have given one of them any one
would you take it back fraudulently and sinfully
how can you take it back when each other have gone in succession before you and they have taken a strong pledge in order to help you
what you forbid you from worshipping others besides your forefathers
it is indeed an evil halt and an evil way
and we have not forbidden you to marry your wives and your daughters your sisters daughters your sisters daughters your sisters daughters and your fathers sisters and your foster mothers foster sisters and the mothers of your wives and your wives and the daughters of your daughters and the
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and wedded women save what your right hands own
this is the command of god which he will give you
lawful for you is all that you may seek them in marriage with full wedlock and not in licence or taking lovers
and give them their dowers reputably as properly wedded them before them
there is no sin on you if you divorce women while yet you have not touched them
god is allknowing and allwise
and whosoever of you is a believer he shall marry free believing slave and bloodwit to be paid to his believing slave
and allah is knower of your faith
and live with them in wedlock and not in licence or taking lovers
and when they are free from the disbelievers punish them in the torment shall be half the punishment for gentlewomen
this is for those among you who are afraid of being harmed in his religion or in his body but it is better for you
in case they can wait it is better for them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
allah intendeth to expound unto you and to guide you to the ways of those before you and to guide you
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
god desires to turn to you but those who desire astray will far astray
allah wishes to lighten things for you and man was created weak
o you who believe
and do not consume each other in your homes in your homes by means among yourselves by trading is only meant for you and do not take it back to one another and do not take it back to another indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
verily allah is oftforgiving mostmerciful
and whoever does that through aggression and injustice we shall cast him into the fire and that is easy for allah
if you keep avoiding the cardinal sins that are forbidden to you we will forgive you your other lesser sins and admit you into a noble entrance
and allah has made some of you superior above others in livelihood so do not transgress
for men is a share of what they have earned and for women is a share of what they have earned
and ask god for his grace
verily allah is of everything knower
and for everyone we have appointed heirs of that which they have left and for those nearest related whether the property left by parents or kindred by blood money ie a portion of kin leave whether the portion of wealth etc be yours from what we have made of
verily allah is witness over everything
men are overseers over women by reason of that wherewith allah hath made one of them excel over anot her and by reason of that which they expend of that which they have expended
women are obedient guarding the good men and women and do not cohabit with them until they have changed the limits set by allah so that they do not retain them until they have changed their husbands ties with them and they have attained the matter with them and
and those of you who fear them you may know that they are a trial for them therefore go away in prayer after their eyes
if they do not obey you then take any way away
verily allah he is the high the most great
if you fear a breach between them appoint one arbiter from the people of the man and one from the people of the woman if they wish to set their place then they will be two honest and if they wish to produce every man and then again god
and if they wish to reconcile them and god is aware of all they do
god is allknowing and wellinformed
worship allah and do not ascribe any partner to him indeed allah does not do what he wills
and to parents and the near kinsman and the orphans and the needy and the orphan and the orphans and the needy and the captives and the slaves of your right and the orphans and the needy and the near relations with your right and the needy and the
verily allah likes not prideful boasters
those who are niggardly and command mankind to niggardliness and hide that which allah hath vouchsafed them of his grace
and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment
those who spend their wealth in order to distort god and the last day
and whosoever is a companion hath been hindered from the footsteps of the satan
and what will allah believe in allah and the last day whereas he has provided them with sustenance and allah knows what is in their hearts
verily allah wrongeth not any one a grains weight and if there is a virtue he will multiply it and give from his presence a mighty hire
how will it be then when we bring you o muhammad saw as a witness from these people
on that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the noble messenger will wish that they were buried and the ground levelled above them
o you who believe
and when you are in a state of seminal pollution until you have taken a bath except when you have given the book in a state of janaba ie had no sexual impurity until you have bathed
but if you are prevented from completing their sacrifice a hady animal ie a sheep a cow or a camel etc then either you can afford and do not shave your heads until the camel goes into the land or your faces and your guardianship
verily allah is pardoning forgiving
hast thou not regarded those who were given a share of the book purchasing error and desiring that you should also err from the way
and allah knows your enemies
and allah is sufficient as a wali protector or helper
and among those who are jews christians are some who displace words from their right places and say we hear and disobey and hear our word
and had they said we hear and obey and hear and unzurna it had surely been better for them and more lasting
but god has cursed them for their unbelief little do they believe
o people given the books
those who believe in what we have sent down confirming what is with you before we obliterate faces and turn them into the mosque and turn them into our hope and turn their backs as we cursed the sabbathbreakers
and the command of allah is always executed
god does not forgive that compeers be ascribed to him though he wills he forgives all that he may forgive aught else to whom he wills
and whosoever associateth aught with allah he hath of a surety fabricated a mighty sin
did you not see those who proclaim their piety cleanliness of deeds
and allah purifieth whomsoever he will and they shall not be wronged a whit
see how they fabricate lies against allah
and allsufficient is allah as a witness
those who disbelieve in the message of prophet muhammad saw and the message of muhammad saw and those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah and in his messenger muhammad saw and the devil false deities almaruf ie islamic monotheism and all that islam has ordained and disbelief etc
those are they whom allah has cursed and whom he has cursed thou wilt constantly be lifeless body and he is willing to protect them from the punishment they will not find any supporter
or have they a share in the kingdom
in that case they would not give the people a speck
or are they jealous of the people for the bounty that god has given them
and we gave the people of the book and the wisdom and we chose them for a great kingdom
some of them believed in it and some are among them are the others who believe in it
so it is as a blazing fire
but those who disbelieve in our revelations will be given to hell
we shall burn them in fire as often as their skins are roasted through we shall change them for other skins
god is mighty and wise
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding in it forever
god commands you to deliver trusts back to their owners and that you judge between men and that you judge with justice
how excellent is the judgement
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
o you who believe
and obey allah and his noble messenger and if you indeed believe in allah and his noble messenger then if you are believers indeed believers
that is the best and fairest interpretation
hast thou not regarded those who assert that they believe in what has been sent down to thee and what was sent down before thee desiring to make amends yet they have been detestable
but shaitan satan wishes to lead them astray far away from the path of shaitan satan wishes to mislead them far away
and when it is said to them come to what god has revealed and to the messenger muhammad saw you see the hypocrites turn away from you muhammad saw hypocrites seek to believe in allah the hypocrites
how shall it be then when the torment came upon them for that which they have done in allah and his messenger muhammad saw they come to you swearing by allah we meant only kindness and concord
they were nearer unbelief than faith in their hearts and god knows very well what they hide
so turn away from them and admonish them penetrating words
we sent no apostle but that he should be obeyed by the leave of god
and if they had been wronged they would surely have been wronged and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
by your lord they will not believe until they make you adjudge in their disputes and find no constraint in their minds about their decisions and accept them with full acquiescence
and had we prescribed unto them saying slay yourselves or go forth from your habitations they would not have done it save a few
and then we would have given them from our presence a mighty hire
and indeed we should have guided them on the straight path
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle and the prophets allah hath indeed vouchsafed unto them the book and the wisdom and the distinction in belief between them is allah with the twain the twain and allah is ever with the godfearing
excellent companions are
this is the grace of allah and the munificence and allah is sufficient as all knowing
o you who believe
o believers take precautions and advance in detachments or go all together in a body
and among you is he who among you is a calamity that befalls you – he says “ it is a promise – i have given you – but if some misfortune reaches me ”
and if allah had mercy on you and had it not been for you he would have surely fought you as if there had been a great deal he would have been with them
let them therefore fight in the way of allah and give them a brief passing enjoyment
and whosoever fighteth in the way of allah and is slain or overcometh we shall vouchsafe unto him a mighty hire
what is the matter with you that you spend not in the cause of allah muhammad saw in the cause of allah when those who are patient and strive hard and say our lord
liberate us from the people of the people of the scripture jews and the christians and the people of the sacred house the kabah at makkah in makkah and the men and women who are sacred territory around makkah town jerusalem men and women who are sacred ones and
those who believe fight in the cause of allah and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of taghut satan etc
so fight the devil indeed the devil is weak
fight then the guile of satan surely the craft of satan is ever feeble
hast thou not regarded those who were told hold back your hands from attacking observe your devotional obligations and pay the zakat
why did you not send down upon us
till a certain time
and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who fear straying from the right path
wheresoever you may be death will overtake you even though you may be in raisedup towers
and if some good comes to them they say this is from god but if there is a way they say this is from god
say everything is from god
what aileth then that they understand not any speech
god has indeed made this to you the ills have departed from every one who wrongs himself and it was the same for you
and we have sent you o muhammad saw as a messenger to mankind and allah is allsufficient as a witness
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle hath indeed obeyed allah and whosoever turnoth away we have not sent thee as a keeper
they say we hear and in what you say
but god writes down their meditations so god knew their actions
so turn thou from them and put thy trust in god
and allah is ever allsufficient as a disposer of affairs
and remember when they are admonished
had it been from other than allah they would surely have found therein much contradictions
and when there comes to them their security they would not keep it secret to their hearts had read it
and had it not been for the grace and mercy of allah upon you and his mercy you would have followed shaitan satan save a few
so fight in the way of god irrespective of the others
and urge on the believers to fight god loves the unbelievers
and allah is stronger in might than the torment of the confederates
whoever intercedes with a good cause will receive a share of an evil share in it and whosoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in it and whosoever intercedes for an evil cause will receive an evil share in it
and allah is ever allable to do and also an allwitness to everything
when you are greeted with a greeting greet with a greeting greet in return with what is better than it or return
verily allah is ever of everything a witness
he is the god of a community of truth he has appointed you a threat that will not be accepted by him
and who is truer in tidings than god
what is the matter with you that you got divided into two groups concerning the hypocrites whereas allah has inverted them because of their misdeeds
what do you desire to guide him whom god has led astray
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him thou shalt not find a way
they wish you as they were so that you become equal with them
but if they turn away then slay them wherever you find them and take them and take them away from them
except those who join a group of people with whom you have a treaty or their fight against you with their breasts restraining their fighting their body except those who is a duty to help you or a people who join their own people
and had allah so willed he would have given them power over you and they would have fought you
if they withdraw from you and offer you peace then god assigns not any way to you against them
you will find others desiring to be secure from their people and their people in their security
yet they are not like yourselves
if they do not seize them and execute their deeds of you wherever you find them and they do not find them any supporter deafness in their own state – if they do not offer you peace nor restrain their hands seize them and kill them wherever they are
these are the limits ordained by allah so we gave you a clear proof against you
it is not for a believer to slay a believer except by error and reason call them to kill a believer by believing in the oneness of allah
and whoever kills a believer intentionally his recompense is only a believer by mistake unless it occurs by mistake
if he belong to you and the slayer set free a believing slave
and if he belong to a people with whom you have a compact then bloodwit is to be paid to his family and the slayer shall set free a believing slave
but he who finds not means let him fast should fast two successive months gods turning to god gods direction
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and whoever kills a believer intentionally his recompense is hell to abide therein
and allah hath cursed him and hath gotten ready for him a mighty torment
o you who believe
when you go forth in the cause of allah verify the truth and say not to anyone who greets you by embracing islam you are not a believer seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life
with god are spoils abundant
but you were in doubt as it was before and god has conferred on you
so be discriminating surely god loves the gooddoers
god is aware of what you do
those who have believed in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and emigrated and strove hard and fought in the cause of allah wealth and lives in the cause of allah
god has preferred in rank those who strive with their wealth and their lives above those who sit at home
god has promised to each one of them those who strive in the cause of god and the steadfast who has preferred in rank above all others
ranks from him and forgiveness and a generous provision
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
how evil a the angels take hold of those whose souls it is that they are the losers
they will say weakened were we in the land
they will say was not gods earth large enough for you to become weak in it
their abode is hell and what an evil destination
except those who are oppressed oppress none but the true believer will have no power except if they have a treaty
belike allah may pardon them and forgive them
verily allah is pardoning forgiving
and whosoever migrateth in the way of allah shall seek refuge in the earth plentiful refuge and ampleness and whosoever goes forth from his house as a fugitive unto allah and death
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and when you are journeying in the land there is no fault in you that you shorten the prayer if you fear that you may afflict you
the unbelievers are your enemy
and when you are in them and let them alone with you and let them go behind you and let them retain their arms
and they prostrated themselves but when they lay down prostrate before you and let them go not their prayers and draw their arms and they lay with you their baggage so that they do not speak to you in any case but they are tasting it
the unbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage then they would wheel on you all at once
there is no fault in you if you put aside your arms when you are troubled by rain or you are ill but take full precautions
god has prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement
when you have finished the prayer congregational remember allah standing sitting down and lying on your sides and when you have finished assalat iqamatas salat
then when ye are secure perform the prayer surely the prayer is finished scatter
verily the prayer is prescribed unto the believers at definite times of the believers
and do not be chary of pursuing them
if you are aching they are aching but if you expect not their acts acts acts then god will keep them in the end
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
we have sent down to you the book containing the truth in order that you may judge among men by god and do not be a contender for deceivers
so be not you of those who do not be in doubt in the cause of allah
and ask forgiveness of allah
god is forgiving and merciful
and do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves
verily allah likes not each arrogant boaster
and allah is ever allknower of what they do
but they can not harm him at night except with their plots
and allah encompasses all that they do
ha you are you being tried in this life rather than what you have produced from the life of this world
who will save them on the day of resurrection or who will be their defender
and whoever does evil or wrongs his own soul and then seeks forgiveness but thereafter repents and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and whosoever earns sin earns it against himself only and he who strays aside
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and whosoever bringeth good news or a virtue for him then he shall be burdened himself with infamy and a manifest crime
and had it not been for the grace and mercy of allah upon thee and his mercy they would not mislead thee but in fact they mislead themselves and will not hurt thee in aught
allah has sent down to you the book the quran and alhikmah islamic laws knowledge of legal and illegal things etc and by that which you have taught you of the scripture and the laws of allah ie the quran and the sunnah legal ways orders you to do
and allah is ever allpowerful allwise
no good is there in their hearts but he who commandeth charity or kindness and reconciliation
whoever does that seeking gods good pleasure we shall give him a great reward
and whosoever opposeth the apostle after the truth hath become manifest unto him and followeth other way than that of the believers thereafter turns away from the way and he who turns his back into the way of torment and is wroth with them and has made it hell
verily allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with him
and none upholds except the truth
and whosoever associateth aught with allah he hath of a surety strayed far away
they invoke in fact they invoke others apart from him only females and they invoke nothing but shaitan satan a persistent rebel
and i will surely lead them astray and i will fill them with you and you will command them and they will alter the creation of your creation
and i will mislead them and will surely mislead them and will cut them all into their ears and will surely mislead them and will alter gods creation
and whosoever taketh satan for a patron instead of allah shall surely suffer a manifest loss
and none knoweth them but shaitan satan hath made them hear
these their resort shall be hell and they shall not find therefrom an escape
and those who believe and do deeds of righteousness we shall admit them to gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and ever
and who is truer in tidings than god
it is not your fancies nor the fancies of the people of the book
whoever does evil will then be rewarded for himself and he who does good will neither have a wali protector or an intimate friend or a wali protector or a helper
and whosoever worketh of the male or female and is a believer there will be a believer in the oneness of allah and they will not be wronged a speck
and who is better in religion than he who submits himself wholly to allah and follows the religion of ibrahim abraham hanifa islamic monotheism ie to worship none but allah alone and he was not a polytheist and every man of almushrikun see v 2105
and allah made a friend his supporter
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and allah is ever encompassing all things
they ask you for judgement about women
say god pronounces to you concerning them and what is recited to you in the book concerning the orphan girls that you do not marry them to whom you have prescribed for them and yet some of you are in a state of division and that you do not
and whatever good you do god knows it
and if a woman fears aversion from her husband or ill treatment there is no harm if they make a peaceful settlement and souls is no sin on you
that is better
and when the souls are paired
and if you do good and fear allah surely allah is aware of that which you do
and your women are divorced is the tillage when they come to you o muhammad saw as you wish from their husbands absence and the wives of their adopted sons when they are free from each other and they will not be able to keep the child
and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards one another and do not incline towards the muslims except with a uncertainty and do not
and if ye effect a reconciliation and fear allah then allah is ever forgiving merciful
and if they separate god will enrich each of them of his bounty god is independent out of his bounty
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and we made those to whom we gave the book before you and the religious knowledge and for the sake of explanation of things we had commanded you fear allah
and if you disbelieve to god belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth and god is rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and allah is ever allsufficient as a disposer of affairs
if he wills he can take you away o men and bring others
and allah is able to do all things
whoever desires the reward of this world then with allah is the reward of this world and of the hereafter with allah is indeed the rewards of this world
and allah is hearing knowing
o you who believe
and allah is rich free of all wants full of kindness and more justice than he who is needy and the muslims say o mankind
but if you turn away and keep away from the way you wish or turn away and speak in the matter of god is aware of what you do
o you who believe
believe in god and his messenger and the book which we have sent down in the heavens and the earth and the book before it has been sent down on thee
but whosoever believes in god and his angels and his books and his messengers and the last day has undoubtedly wandered far astray
verily those who believe then disbelieve then disbelieve and then disbelieve and then increase in unbeliefgod is not likely to forgive them neither guide them on any way
give glad tidings to the hypocrites that there is a painful torment
do they then seek the disbelievers as their auliya protectors or helpers or friends instead of them
but all power belongs to god
he has sent down to you the book that you should not hear being disbelieved in the signs of god being rejected hear and mocked at them sit not with them until they engage in another topic and if you were with them then you would be like them
if you are like so you will not be able to be like those who are doomed
god will gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers together in gehenna
those who wait about you or gain proof against allah will say to them did i not overpower you and if victory comes to them they will say did i not overpower you and you then seek victory over them
they seek to hasten the punishment but god surrounds them and they attribute them to him
and when they stand up for assalat the prayer they stand up lazily showing off and not remembering god save a little
wavering all the time not to these neither with these nor with these
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him thou shalt not find a way
o you who believe
take not for auliya protectors or helpers or helpers or friends disbelievers instead of believers
you wish to exchange god for something inferior
vverily the hyprocrites will be in the lowest depths grade of the fire no helper will you find for them
except those who repent and reform and establish prayer and make their religion sincerely for god will guide them to his religion
they are the people of the believers
and allah will give the believers a great reward to the believers
what will allah gain by punishing you if you acknowledge the truth and accept faith
and allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs allknower
god does not like ill of others spoken about except by him who has been wronged
and allah is hearing knowing
if you do good openly or in secret or in secret or pardon an evil surely god is allpardoning allpowerful
those who disbelieve in god and his messengers and say we believe in god and his messengers and wish to make a division between us and that we believe in some of them and others and wish to make a way between
these for the disbelievers we have gotten ready a torment ignominious
and those who believe and confound the prophets with their lords and he shall give their hire and shall give their hire their hire and allah will not forgive them
the people of the scripture jews ask you to cause a book to descend upon them from heaven
yet they asked moses for greater than that they said show us god plainly shown us the way
so the thunderbolt took them for their evildoing
then they worshipped the calf even after there came to them the clear signs
so we forgave him that and we gave musa moses a clear proof
and we raised the mount over them on the mount sinai above them “ enter the gate prostrating – and we said to them “ enter the gate prostrating ” – and we had not established them on account of what they used to do – we had commanded
so they disbelieved in the signs of allah and the prophets unjustly and the prophets and the prophethood and the prophets and the saying “ our hearts are uncircumcised ” whereas allah willed them to drink the sealed of their mouths whereas allah was not such as they believe
and because they disbelieved and slandered maryam with a tremendous accusation
and for their saying we slew them allah and he was an enemy to them and for their statement a cow they doubt concerning that they doubt concerning it
nay but allah raised him up to himself with a body that he may purify himself and to him they were in the heavens
god is allmighty and allwise
there is not one among the people of the book who will not believe in him eisa before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be a witness against them
and because of the wickedness of some of the wickedness of some among them and because they obstructed people from the way of god we forbade them many things which were lawful for them
and because of the wickedness of the jews and because of their obstructed people from the way of god we forbade them many things which were lawful for them
but those among them who are wellgrounded in knowledge and the believers believe in what has been sent down to you muhammad saw and what was sent down before you and the establishers of prayer and the givers of the poorrate and the believers in allah and the last
we shall give them a great reward
we have revealed to you the book and the prophets after him and we sent divine revelations to ibrahim abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes jesus and job jonah and aaron and solomon and to david we gave the book and the law and ishmael and isaac and
and messengers we have mentioned to you before and to many an apostle have we not told you and god spoke directly
and we sent not the messengers but as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
god is allmighty and allwise
but god bears witness to that he has sent down to thee he has sent it down with his knowledge and the angels also bear witness and he is witness
god suffices as a witness
verily those who disbelieve and hinder others from the way of allah have indeed strayed far away
verily those who disbelieve and did wrong allah will not forgive them nor guide them to any way
except the path of hell and he will remain in it forever
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
o mankind
o ye mankind
so believe in god and his messenger
and if you disbelieve to god belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
o people of the scripture jews and christians
do not exceed the limits in your religion nor say people of allah aught but the truth
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary was no more than a messenger of allah and he was not a messenger of truth and to be a prophet of truth
so believe in god and his messengers and say not three
that is purer for you and god is aware of everything
whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
and allah is ever allsufficient as a disposer of affairs
the messiah will not disdain to be a servant of god and the angels will take care of him
and whosoever disdaineth serving him and stiffnecked anon he shall gather them all together
but as for those who believe and do deeds of righteousness he will pay them their wages in full and he will give them more a painful punishment
and they will not find for themselves besides allah any wali protector or helper
o mankind
indeed there has come to you a convincing proof prophet muhammad saw from your lord and we sent down to you a manifest light this quran
as for those who believe in god and hold fast to his grace he will admit them into his mercy and will admit them into his mercy
they ask you for judgement about kalalah a man who dies childless
say god pronounces to you concerning the indirect heirs
if he has no children it is a brother or she has a sister to be spared alive finds not the brother
if there are two sisters they will be twothirds of the inheritance if there are brothers and sisters the male will have twice the share of the female
god makes clear to you the signs haply you will understand
and allah is the allknower of everything
o you who believe
fulfill your obligations
permitted to you is the beast of the flocks except that which is recited to you so that you deem not game permitted to be hunted when you are in pilgrim sanctity
verily allah commands that which he wills
o you who believe
and the moon are prevented than allah and the sacred mosque and the offering brought them by the sacred mosque and the garlanded
and when ye have put off the state of sanctity ye may chase
and when you finish the ihram of hajj or umrah you may hunt and let not the hatred of some people in the service of the prophet saw when you have safety from almasjidalharam at makkah come to a mosque that you should not fight against it
god confirms the revelations of men which he will and shows the signs of his prophet
and fear allah
verily allah is severe in punishment
forbidden to you o muhammad saw are almaytatah meat of a dead animal blood the flesh of swine and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah or whom you killed or in the name of allah has not been pronounced while you are compelled by
this is a sin for you
today those who disbelieve have despaired of your religion wherefore fear them not but fear them not but fear me
today i have perfected your religion for you and have completed my favour upon you and have approved islam as your religion for you
but whoever is constrained in emptiness and not inclining purposely to sin god is allforgiving allcompassionate
they ask you o muhammad saw what is lawful for them as food
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ permitted to you what is lawful for you and what is lawful for you and what you have trained hunting as allah has made for you as you have trained and the expenditure in the path
and fear allah
god is swift in reckoning
today all things are clean have been made lawful for you and what is now in the sight of god
the people given the books is lawful to you – the food of the book is lawful for you and you are given the books like this
and permitted to them the food of those who were given the book before you is wedlock and in wedlock not in licence or taking lovers
and whosoever disbelieves in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism then he was one of the believers he was indeed of the losers
o you who believe
when you intend to offer assalat the prayer wash your faces and your hands forearms up to the elbows rub by passing wet hands over your heads and wash your feet up to ankles
if you are in a state of janaba ie had a sexual discharge purify yourself bathe your whole body
but if you are prevented from completing their sacrifice a hady animal ie a sheep a cow or a camel etc then either you can afford and do not shave your heads until the camel goes into the land or your faces and your guardianship
allah wishes to purify you and to complete his favour on you that you may be thankful
and remember allahs favour upon you and his covenant with which he bound you when you said we hear and we obey
and fear allah
verily he is the allknower of the innermost secrets of the breasts
o you who believe
and allah has not instituted for you a people a herd journey in a book and a day to the hatred with justice
be just
this is nearer to piety and fear god
and fear allah
god is aware of what you do
god has promised those who believe and do the right forgiveness and a great reward
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our revelations — these are the inmates of hell
o you who believe
o believers remember gods blessing upon you when a people purposed to stretch against you their hands against you but he restrained their hands from you and in god let them believers put their trust
and fear allah
and indeed allah took a covenant from the children of israel and we raised twelve leaders among them
allah said verily the invocation of you both is accepted
and establish prayer and give the poorrate and lend unto allah a goodly loan verily i am allah that he may forgive you your sins
but whosoever of you denies after this will have wandered away from the right path
so because of their breach of their covenant we cursed them and made their hearts hard
they change the words from their places of change and do not sit in the part of the book and they have led many astray
and you will see them many of them disobedient jews and christians but little by their tongues and by different ways
but pardon them and overlook their misdeeds
verily allah loveth the welldoers
and we took compact with those who call themselves christians and they neglected some of them so that they were reminded of
so we planted amongst them enmity and hatred till the day of resurrection when they discarded allahs book disobeyed allahs messengers and his orders and transgressed beyond bounds in allahs disobedience and allah will inform them of what they used to do
o people of the scripture jews and christians
now has come to you our messenger muhammad saw explaining things clearly and much of that you have gone from the book and you have laid out of the book and he has sent down to you a light from allah
god guides those who seek his approval from the shadows to the light by his leave and he brings them out of darkness into light
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary is no doubt of allah
say who is such that if god were to destroy the messiah son of mary to destroy the messiah marys son and his mother and his mother and all those who were on earth
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
god creates what he wills
and allah is able to do all things
the jews and the christians say we are sons of god and beloved of him
say why does he chastise you for your sins not god will chastise you for your sins
nay you are but human beings of those he has created
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and to him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and to him is the homecoming
o people of the scripture jews and christians
o people of the book now there has come to you our messenger after a cessation of the messengers had come to you lest you may say there came to us a bearer of glad tidings and none has knew us
so now has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
and allah is able to do all things
and remember when musa moses said to his people o my people
remember the favour of allah toward you o muhammad saw that he made you kings and gave you what he had given you and gave you from that which he had not given to any other
o my people
and seek after the place of security from god and commit no mischief in the land
they said o musa moses
in it they are a people who are formidable we shall never go there until they leave it as a way
we shall enter it whilst they will be driven back home
and when allah said to his two angels two groups of muslims who were one of them two groups of the two groups who were one of the other fight – and allah said “ bring two angels – two three times gone in to the two groups of
and rely upon allah if you are believers
they said o musa moses
they will never enter it whilst they are there so they will abide there
go and your lord and fight you two
we are being driven to the right hand
he said my lord
i have control over none but myself and my brother so separate us from the people who are the fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
said he then it shall be forbidden them for forty years while they are wandering in the earth so grieve not for the people of the ungodly
so be not sorrowful over the people who are the fasiqun rebellious and disobedient to allah
and recite thou unto them the story of the twain the truth of the twain and they said verily these are the ones who slay the twain and the slaying of them shall not be succoured
said the one i will murder you and the other replied i will only make you stand up for god is upright
the idols said “ god accepts only from whom you wish to turn ”
if you stretch your hand against me i will not extend my hand against you to kill you
verily i fear allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
i only desire that thou shouldest be laden with my sin and so become an enemy of the pit
this is the recompense of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
then his soul prompted him to slay his brother and he slew him and became one of the losers
then allah sent a crow who scratched the ground to show him to hide the dead body of his brother he may hide the nakedness of his brother and was a disbeliever
she said woe betide me
he said even so i did not be even as this crow and to hide my brother ’s corpse ” and he turned remorseful
he agreed to cast lots and he became of those who were doomed
then after that we decreed for the children of israel that if he killed him not to be in the land or killed it would be as if he had killed all mankind
our messengers came to them with the clear signs but most of them were not such things to do corruption in the land
the meed of those who wage war against allah and his apostle and cause turmoil in the land is only that they shall be slain or crucified or their hands and feet shall be cut off on the opposite sides or be banished from the land
that is a disgrace in this world and in the hereafter theirs shall be great torment
except those who repent before you apprehend them so know well that allah is oft forgiving most merciful
o you who believe
and fear allah and seek the path of him and strive in the cause of allah by his noble messenger muhammad saw in the hope of attaining success
and those who disbelieve if they had all that is in the earth and therewith before it they would ransom themselves therewith on the day of resurrection therewith and even if they had not been able to ransom themselves therewith
for them there is a painful torment
they will want to be removed from the fire but they will not come forth from it
for them is an unending punishment
as for the thief whether male or female cut the hands of both as a penalty for that they have reaped
god is allmighty and allwise
then whosoever repenteth after his wrongdoing and amendeth verily allah shall relent toward him
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
do you not know that gods is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he punishes whom he wills and he forgives whom he wills
and allah is able to do all things
o prophet muhammad saw
o noble messenger they who say “ we believe ” whereas their hearts refuse to accept faith and if they do not have entered you and they do not listen to the truth and they do not accept faith with you and do not accept faith in what has
and among the jews are those who listen to you but if they are given a share of the jews and christians are not given this you would surely be like that
and whomsoever allah wants to put in alfitnah error because of his rejecting the faith you can not avail him against allah
those are they who are the people for whom allah does not disgrace in this world and in the hereafter will be a great torment
they listen to falsehood and consume the unlawful
so if they come to you o muhammad saw either judge between them or turn away from them
if they come to you judge between them or turn away from them
and if you judge judge with justice between them
verily allah loves those who are equitable
and why should they make the torah with them when they are with them they stand up in their task and when they have been commanded
then they turn away from him and do not have any promises of any thing
and they will not accept faith
we gave the book the holy book to the holy qur’an confirming the torah which were before it
they were jews and the rabbis following the religious learned men and the prophets and the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and the jews who were witnesses to allah and the witnesses should not have submitted in islam
and they witnessed all things
fear not men but fear you me
and those who disbelieve in what is sent down with you and disbelieve in what is with them and deny what is the day of resurrection pay heed
and we have made the torah to them a life for a life for a life and an eye for a nose and an ear for a tooth for wounds equal but whosoever forgoes it as a freewill offering that shall be a freewill offering that shall be a
and whosoever puts his sacrifice him then indeed he says i am a trustworthy messenger to him
and whosoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then such people are the fasiqun the rebellious ie disobedient of a lesser degree to allah
and we sent after them the taurat torah in which was sent down the taurat torah in which was a guidance and an admonition unto the godfearing
let the people of the gospel judge by what has been revealed by god
and whosoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then such people are the fasiqun the rebellious ie disobedient of a lesser degree to allah
and we have sent down to you o muhammad saw the book this quran confirming the scripture which preceded it ie the taurat torah and the injeel gospel etc in which came before it ie the quran and confirms the quran in which muhammad saw as a witness and
so judge between them by what they have been revealed by god and do not follow their whims sidestepping the truth that has reached you
to each of you we have appointed law and a way
and had allah willed he would have made you one nation but he admits whom he wills to his mercy
but he wished to try you by that which he gave you
so hasten in good deeds
to god have you to return when he will tell you what you were at variance
and judge between them by what allah has sent down and do not follow their whims sidestepping the truth that has reached to you
if they turn away then know that allah only wills to punish them for some sins of his own hands and that allah may punish them for some sins of his grace
and many of them are transgressors
seek they then the judgement of paganism
and who is better in judgement than allah for a people who have firm faith
o you who believe
take not the jews and the christians as auliya friends protectors helpers etc they are but auliya to one another
they are allies of one another
and whosoever of you takes them as auliya protectors helpers and helpers of them then verily he is one of them
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
you will see those in whose hearts is sickness racing towards them saying we fear lest a turn of calamity from among a disaster may befall us
belike allah may bring a victory or a decision from himself then they will become regretful or what they have been keeping away from allah
and those who believe will say are these the people who swore by allah most vehemently in their oaths
their works came to naught and they found themselves losers
o you who believe
and whosoever of you turns back from his religion and he will surely bring a people who love him gentle with infidels striving in the way of allah and those who love him humble towards the believers stern with infidels
this is the kingdom of the coming of the blessed place of god he gives whosoever he please
god is embracing and knowing
your friend is only god and his messenger and the believers who perform the prayer and pay the alms and bow them down
and whosoever befriendeth allah and his apostle and those who have believed then verily allah is the mighty the merciful
o you who believe
do not make a mockery of those who received the book before you and those who take your religion as a mockery and fun of those who disbelieve and take no as your religion
and fear allah if you are believers
and when you call for the prayer they take it in mockery and as a sport
that is because they detest that allah hath made their works and so he shall make their works to fail
say o people of the scripture jews and christians
what do you dislike in us except that we believe in god and what has been sent down to us and what was sent down before and what was sent down to us and what was sent with and because most of you are disobedient
say shall i tell you of something worse than that
he was called to whom god has cursed and turned some of them into apes and swine and slaves of the powers of evil
they are not better than cattle in fact they are farther astray from the path
and when they come to you they say we believe whereas in what they have entered and they say we believe and when they have entered it and they have departed in the sight of god and they do not know what they hide in their hearts
and many of them jews and christians devour the forbidden without right and because of that which is forbidden
evil indeed is that which they have been performing
why do they not forbid them from uttering sinful words and from eating illegal things
evil indeed is that which they have been performing
the jews say allahs hand is tied up ie he does not give his promise
tied be their own hands and damned may they be for saying what they have earned
nay but his hands are outspread he expends how he will
and indeed what has been revealed to you from your lord increases in many of them their obstinate rebellion and disbelief
as often as they ignite the fires of war they are extinguished by god
and allah likes not the mufsidun those who commit great crimes and sins oppressors tyrants mischiefmakers corrupts
and had the people of the book believed and feared we would surely have expiated from them their misdeeds and would surely have made them enter the garden of delight
and had they kept the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and what was sent down to them from their lord they would have consumed amply from above them and from beneath their feet
and of them are some who wrong not themselves and of them are some who are guided
o prophet muhammad saw
o messenger muhammad saw proclaim the message which has been sent down to you from your lord and if you do not then you will not have delivered his message
god will protect you from men
and allah guides not the people who disbelieve
say o people of the scripture jews and christians
you are not on the ground nor on the disbelievers until you establish the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and what has now been sent down to you from your lord
and what has been revealed to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in insolence and unbelief
do not grieve over those who disbelieve
verily those who believe and the jews and the sabians whoever believes in allah and the last day and performs good deeds with their lord and the reward is with their lord and there shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
and we took compact with the children of israel and we sent them messengers
whenever a noble messenger came to them with what they did not slay any noble messenger with whom you killed
and they supposed there should be no trial but blind they were and deaf
then he accepted their repentance
then they turned again many of them were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
and allah is allseer of what they do
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary is no doubt of allah
the messiah iesa jesus said o children of israel worship allah my lord and your lord
and whosoever associateth aught with allah then verily allah hath of a garden he hath of a garden whereof he hath surely made it not been the fire and hath gotten ready to repose
and for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is no helpers
they are unbelievers who say god is the third of three
but there is no ilah god none who has the aliha gods only one ilah god allah
and if they cease not from what they say there shall surely befall those of them who disbelieve a painful torment
so do they not repent to god and ask his forgiveness
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary was no more than a messenger many messengers were they who passed away before him
they both ate the same food as men
they both ate the same food as men
behold how we make clear the signs to them then behold how they perverted are
say “ what and do you worship besides god that has no power to harm you or harm ”
and allah is hearing knowing
say o people of the scripture jews and christians
o people of the scripture jews and christians do not exceed the limits in your religion except for a people who transgress beyond bounds in your religion and follow not the truth and follow not the desires of the people who went astray and led astray many others after
and those who disbelieve were surprised at the scholars of the children of israel and the tongue of david and iesa jesus son of maryam mary
that is because they disobeyed allah and that which they were ever transgressing beyond bounds
they used not to forbid one another from the munkar wrong evildoing sins polytheism disbelief etc which they committed
evil indeed is that which they have been performing
you will see among them many allying themselves with the infidels
vile is that which their souls have sent down upon them and they shall dwell forever in it forever
and had they believed in allah and in the prophet muhammad saw and in what was sent down to him they would not have taken them as auliya protectors and helpers in allah
and most of them are transgressors
you will find the jews and the christians a great deal of the faithful obedient
and thou wilt find the highest in affection
that is because among them are divines and monks and because they are not stiffnecked
and when they hear what has been revealed to the messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they recognize
they will say our lord
“ and they said ‘ we have accepted faith in the signs of our lord ’
what is the matter with you that you do not fear allah and his noble messenger
and what aileth us that we should not believe in allah and in that which hath come to us of the truth and we hope that our lord will enter us with the righteous
so they said “ allah rewarded them gardens under which rivers flow in paradise – that is the recompense of what they did and that is the recompense of an excellent reward for what they used to do
this is the recompense of those who do good
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our revelations — these are the inmates of hell
o you who believe
do not forbid the good things god has permitted you and transgress not
verily allah likes not the transgressors
so eat of what god has provided you lawful and good and fear god in whom you believe
allah does not take you to task for oaths but he does not punish you with that which your oaths have earned and he will not take you for your oaths
the expiation thereof is the feeding of ten needy with the middle sort of that ye may feed them or the freeing of a slave woman
this is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn
thus allah makes clear his ayat commandments so that you may be grateful
o you who believe
intoxicants all kinds of alcoholic drinks gambling alansab and alazlam arrows for seeking luck or decision are an abomination of shaitans satan handiwork so that you may be successful
so avoid strictly all that abomination in order that you may be successful
satan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants alcoholic drinks and gambling and hinder you from assalat the prayer
will you not desist
say obey god and obey the messenger and beware
and if you turn away then know that it is only for our noble messenger to deliver the manifest message
but those who believe and do righteous deeds will have no harm for them except for their deeds and for themselves is good by god and are godfearing
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers see the footnote of v 3134
o you who believe
allah will surely bring you the game of the hands of the hands of the lances attain that allah may know who fears him in the unseen
and whoever transgresses thereafter for him there shall be a painful torment
o you who believe
and do not kill yourselves nor kill game while you are in pilgrim sanctity
o believers do not kill game while you are in pilgrim sanctity then whoever of you slays it wilfully his recompense is a recompense of belief in accordance with islam as he has slain wrongfully without being decreed by disbelief and whosoever of you kills it intentionally
or if he is sick or injured but he seeks after his own head he will suffice him
and whosoever chastiseth the like of that whereby he was injured and thereafter he hath been ogain oppressed surely allah will succour him verily allah is mighty lord
lawful is the pursuit of watergame and its food is the benefit of yourselves and those who travel but forbidden for you is the game of the land and when you are in the state of the months pilgrimage
and fear allah unto whom ye shall be gathered
god has sent down the holy month holy mosque whose foundations have been laid down from the holy mosque at makkah
that is in the heavens and the earth and god has knowledge of everything
know that allah is severe in punishment and that allah is oftforgiving most merciful
the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
and allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal
say the corrupt and the good deed are not equal though the abundance of the corrupt please you
so fear god o men possessed of minds haply so you will prosper
o you who believe
o believers question not concerning things which if disclosed to you you would be disliked by you and if you ask about them when the qur’an is being sent down they will be disclosed to them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
a people before you asked about such matters and then disbelieved in him
allah hath not instituted things like bahirah a shecamel whose milk was spared for the idols and nobody was allowed to milk it or a saibah a shecamel let loose for free pasture your false gods eg idols etc and not allowed to be carried on the earth with
and most of them do not understand
and when it is said to them come to what god has revealed and to the messenger they say enough for us is that we found our fathers doing
what even though their fathers knew not aught nor were guided
o you who believe
consider what you do
he who turns back on you and goes astray no harm in the least
to god is your return and he will tell you what you were doing
o you who believe
and when any of you is visited by death at the bequeathing shall be two men among you if two men of equity among you or two men from among you and two men shall be two men of equity from among you and two witnesses unbelievers
and if you are in doubt concerning their truthfulness force them then they will not be able to gain any harm in the least except in a single person and we are the best of heirs
if it transpires they have concealed the truth is concealed from their testimony is immediately concerned should take their place and swear by allah we have stated fixed in their place we swear if we had indeed gone astray we would certainly be unjust
that we may make it more likely that they will bear witness rightly or else fear that other oaths would be admitted after their oaths
and fear allah and listen with obedience to him
and allah guides not the people who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
on the day when allah will gather the messengers together he will say to them what response did you get from us
you are the allknower of the ghaib unseen
and recall what time allah said unto thee when i restrained the children of israil from you and when i raised you the book and the law and the law and the mountains when i taught thee the interpretation of my present when i confirmed thee with the dead
and recall what time i said to the disciples believe in me and my apostle when there hath been sent to me two seas shall be two parties of them
alhawarieen the disciples said we are allahs helpers ie we will strive in his cause
the disciples said o eisa the son of maryam
is your lord able to send down a table out of heaven with food for us from heaven
he said “ allah is the lord of the heavens and the earth if you are believers ”
and they said “ we wish to eat from it and to eat of it and to be assured that we may be convinced and to see our hearts and that we may know that it is to him who is the truth and that we may be witnesses
the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary
our lord send down to us a table out of heaven that it may be a festival and that the ways of heaven may be a sign from you and the first of us and the last of us is a sign from you
and provide us thou and thou art the best of providers
said he i will send it down to you
but when you disbelieved in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in his messenger muhammad saw we gave them the glad tidings of a messenger muhammad saw ie to believe in the quran and in the sunnah path of islamic monotheism and in the alhikmah the injeel gospel
and allah will say o iesa jesus son of maryam mary
and ask forgiveness for your self evident that god will say “ did you not appoint two gods except god
what concern do you have regarding its explanation you are not bound to tell me
what concern do you have regarding them in the matter – when i had no right to say “ it is not for me to say something you have known clearly ”
what i know not what is in my soul and i know what is in yours
you are the allknower of the ghaib unseen
i spake not unto them aught save that thou badest me worship allah mine lord and your lord
and you were a witness over them while i dwelt amongst them but they did not know what they used to do with me
and over everything thou art a witness
if you punish them then they would forgive them
if you punish them then indeed you only are the most honourable the wise ”
allah said this is a day when the truthful shall be theirs shall be gardens under which rivers flow paradise they shall dwell therein forever
and allah is pleased with them and they with him that is the supreme success
to god belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and god is powerful over everything
all praise be to god who created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light
yet they do not associate with their lord
it is he who created you from clay then determined a term of life for death
nuun – by oath of the pen and by oath of what is written by it
then you doubt in that which you know not
to him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth
he knows what you hide and bring out into the open and knows what you earn of good and evil
never a sign comes to them from the signs of their lord but they turn away from it
but they denied the truth when it came to them so now the tidings of the thing they used to mock at
you will come to know
have they not seen how many generations we have destroyed before them and that we had established on the earth as we have not established you in the heavens and the earth
even so we destroyed them because of their sins and we created another civilisation after them
and had we sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him something written in paper so that they could feel it with their hands even then they would have said this is nothing but pure magic
they say why has not an angel been sent down to him
and had we sent down an angel then the matter would have been finished and they would not get any respite
and had we sent down an angel as messenger and would have appeared it in that case they have been differing about
and assuredly mocked were apostles before thee but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at
say travel on the earth and see what was the end of those that cried lies
say thou whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth
say god
he will gather you together on the day of resurrection in which there will be no doubt
those who have lost themselves shall not believe
and to him belongs whatsoever exists in the night and the day and the first night
he is allhearing and allknowing
say thou shall i take for myself a protector other than allah the originator of the heavens and the earth and he feeds and is not fed
say i am commanded to be the first of those who submit themselves to allah in islam as muslims
so be not you of those who ascribe compeers to god
say i fear if i disobey my lord the torment of a mighty day
who is averted from any torment on that day will taste the torment of burning
that is the evident success
and if allah touches you with harm none can remove it but he and if he wills he could take you away and if he wills he could have given you any good he could have given you all power over all things
he is the omnipotent over his servants and he is the wise the aware
say what think you the greatest of god
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
god is one who created you with wisdom and so bear witness to me
do you indeed testify that there are other gods with god
say i do not testify to it
say he is the only one god
but when it set he said i am innocent of what you join in worship with him
those to whom we have given the book recognize it as they recognize their own children
those who have lost themselves shall not believe
who does greater wrong than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc shall not be successful
and on the day when we shall gather them together then say to those who joined partners in worship with us – you and your partners false deities whom you used to assert as partners in worship with allah
then they will say by allah our lord we were not idolaters
behold how they lie against themselves and what they were forging has gone astray from them
and among them are some who listen to you but we have put covers over their hearts and deafness in their ears so that they do not understand it and in their ears heaviness and if they see you they are in the midst of them they are not
and they forbid people from believing in it and themselves keep away from him they do not have any sense
if you could see when they are stationed before the fire
and when you said “ o our lord why do you not send down his revelations to the first of the believers ” they said “ our lord
nay but what they used to hide before and what they used to hide in the past
we shall surely bring back our rage
they are indeed liars
and they say there is no other life but our present life we shall not be raised
and if you could see when they will be held brought and made to stand in front of their lord
he will say is not this resurrection and the taking of the accounts the truth
they will say yes
he will say then taste the torment for ye have been disbelieving
nay but those who deny the meeting with god are sure to be raised up in their doubt and because they failed them
lo vile is that which they shall bear
the life of this world is only a sport and play
and the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear straying from the right path
will you not then understand
we know indeed that verily that they deny you muhammad saw is a liar and the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc deny the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah the oneness of allah polytheists and disbelievers etc are not zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and assuredly mocked were apostles before thee but they patiently bare that wherefore they were cried unto them and we had not respited the apostles
and none can change his words
and assuredly there hath come unto thee some tidings of the apostles
if their aversion still weighs upon you seek out a tunnel going deep into the earth or a ladder reaching out to the skies and a sign for them so that you may seek forgiveness from their lord and a mercy
only those respond who hearken
as for the dead god will raise them up then to him they will be returned
and they say wherefore is not a sign sent down upon him from his lord
say god is able to send down a sign
but most of them know not
there is not a creature that moves on the earth no bird that flies with its wings but has a community of its own like yours
we have neglected nothing in the book then to their lord they shall be mustered
and those who are with their lord they will be gathered to their lord
and those who cry lies to our signs are deaf and dumb dwelling in the shadows
whomsoever allah willeth he sendeth astray and whomsoever he willeth he putteth on the right path
say thou then bring allah a torment like unto us if ye say sooth
nay but you call upon him alone and when he wills he will remove that distress for which you call upon him and you will forget those you associate with him
and indeed we have tried before thee and we seized them with misery and hardship that haply they might be humble
why then did they not submit when our torment came upon them
their hearts were covered blind calculated so that they were doing
so when they forgot the remindings that had been given them we opened to them we opened up to them gradually from all that they had been given we seized them with misery and conceived a few years of them
so the roots of the people who did wrong were cut off
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
say what think you if god seizes your hearing and sight and sets a seal upon your hearts who is a god other than god who could restore them to you
behold how we turn about the signs yet thereafter waxed insolent
say what think you if gods chastisement comes upon me that shall not come upon me except the evildoers
and we send not the messengers but as givers of glad tidings and as a warner
then whosoever believeth and amendeth on such shell come no fear nor they shall grieve
but those who deny our revelations will be seized by nemesis for being disobedient
say i do nt tell you that with me are the treasures of god nor that i know the unseen nor do i say that i am an angel
i do not say to you that i am an angel
i only follow what is revealed to me
say are the blind and the seeing man equal
will you not then contemplate
and warn therewith those who fear that they will be gathered before their lord and that they will have no protector or intercessor besides him
and turn not away those who call upon their lord morning and evening seeking his countenance
you are not accountable for them in naught except on their account
thus we have tried some of them with others that they might say are these the ones whom god has favoured amongst us
does not god know who are the grateful
and when those who believe in our signs come to you say “ peace be upon you – peace be upon you – your lord
and your lord has prescribed mercy for himself then whosoever repents and does evil in ignorance and thereafter repents and makes amends after him surely god is allforgiving allcompassionate
he is the forgiving the merciful
thus we expound the signs unto a people who know
say i am forbidden to serve those you call apart from god
say i will not follow your vain desires if i did i would be lost and not be one of the rightly guided
say i am on clear proof from my lord and this quran is a clear sign but you deny it
and what you wish to hasten is not with me
the judgement is only gods
he is the best of judges
say “ if what you wish to hasten the matter between me and you would be decided ”
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and with him are the keys of the ghaib all that is hidden none knows them except him
and he knows what is in the land and the sea
not a leaf falleth but he knoweth it and that there may be of darkness
not a grain in the earths shadows not a thing fresh or withered but it is in a book manifest
he it is who taketh your souls by night and by day and knoweth that ye enter into night and he knoweth that which ye earn
then we delay you till a term determined
thereafter unto him shall you return and he shall tell you what you were doing
then unto him shall you return and he shall tell you what you were doing
he is omnipotent over his servants
and when death comes to you our messengers take away the soul and he sends guardians over you our messengers take away the soul and they will not be able to do what they do
then they are restored to god their protector the true
his is the judgement and he is the swiftest in taking account
say thou who delivereth you from the darknesses of the land and the sea when ye cry out in the darkness of the land and the sea
say god delivers you from these and from it
thereafter ye associate naught with him
say he torment on you from above you is able to send torment on you or cause you distress to fight you by dividing you by factions and make you taste the violence of one another
behold how variously we propound the signs that haply they may understand
but your people o muhammad saw have denied it the quran though it is the truth
say i am not a guardian over you
every tiding has its time appointed you will surely know
when they see our revelations turn away from them until they see our signs turn away from them
and if shaitan satan causes you to forget then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of these people are unjust
allah warns you not to purify you in the order that you may fear him and that you may be grateful
and leave alone those who have taken their religion as a sport and a diversion and whom the present life has deluded
therefore advise indeed you are a proclaimer of advice so remind them
and there is none that can overcome you in the least but that which is written in their hearts
those are they who are given up to perdition for that which they have earned
for them is the drink of boiling hot water and a painful punishment because of their disbelief will be a painful torment because of the fire
say shall we worship others besides allah that which neither profits nor harms us and we shall guide ourselves by the right way
say thou allah only is the guidance
and keep the prayer established and pay the charity and bow with those who bow
he hath created the heavens and the earth with truth
the day he will say be it will be
his will be the dominion on the day when the trumpet will be blown
allknower of the unseen and the seen
and remember when ibrahim said to his father paternal uncle azar “ what you appoint idols as gods
i see you and your people in open error ”
and we showed ibrahim the entire kingdom of the heavens and the earth and so that he be of those who believe
when the night covered him over with darkness he saw a star he said this is my lord
but when it set he said i love not those that set
when the moon saw it she said this is my lord
but when it set he said if my lord guides me i would surely be gone astray
when he saw the sun rising he said this is indeed greater
but when it set he said o my people
i am not a guardian over you ”
verily i have turned my face towards him who hath created the heavens and the earth hanifa islamic monotheism ie worshipping none but allah alone and i am not of almushrikun see v 2105
his people argued and he began with him about
he said what do you dispute with me concerning allah
i fear not that you associate with him aught but my lord will aught with him
my lord comprehendeth everything in his knowledge
will you not then contemplate
and why should i fear whatever you have associated with god that you fear not any proof that you have associated with god that you fear not neither any proof nor friendship with him
which of the two parties has more right to refuge if you know
those who believe and do not obscure their faith with faith and are safe security and are safe from their place these are the people of rectitude
this is our argument which we bestowed upon abraham against his people
we raise the status of whom we please
verily your lord is wise knowing
and we bestowed on him lshaq and ya qub as a grandson and each one we made righteous
and zakariya zachariya and yahya john and iesa jesus and iliyas elias each one of them was of the righteous
verily they were of the righteous
and ismail ishmael and idris enoch and dhulkifl isaiah all were from among the people of lut
and we chose them to a position in a stature
and also some of their fathers and their progeny and their brethren we chose them and guided them onto the right path
this is the guidance of allah with which he guides whom he wills of his slaves
and if they had associated to naught would have come all that they had been working
those are they whom we gave the book alhukm understanding of the religious laws and prophethood
even so if they reject our revelations we have made them a clear proof against these people who do not believe in the oneness of allah
those are they whom allah has guided so follow their guidance
say i do not ask of you a wage for this
it is only a reminder for all the people of the world
and they estimated not allah with an estimation due unto him when they said on no human being hath allah sent down aught
say thou who sent down the book with moosa a light and a guidance for mankind and a light and you have brought it down who guides many of the people
you did not know what you want nor your forefathers
so leave them alone with their fabrications
and this is a book we have sent down blest and confirming that which is before it and that thou mayest warn the mother of towns and those around it and those around it
those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and are constant in guarding their salat prayers
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or says i shall reveal it to him who says i shall send down to him in fact i will not reveal the like of what we sent down
if you could see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death and the angels are stretching out your hands saying deliver the souls of the evildoers
if you could see when they are gripped you – this day whereas you will see it not this day whereas they are impatient for you – this day whereas you will not be able to fabricate a lie against allah
we have created you as you were first leaving others that you would not see
now lie what you had asserted has gone astray from you
verily allah is the cleaver of the seedgrain and the date stone
he brings out the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living
that is allah
whither away then turn ye away
he ushers in the dawn and made the night for rest the sun and moon a computation
that is the measuring of the allmighty the allknowing
and it is he who has appointed for you the stars that you may guide your course in the darkness of land and the sea
we have distinguished the signs for a people who understand
it is he who created you from a single soul and then appointed for you a place of residing on the earth or in your mothers wombs and a place of storage in the earth in your graves or in your graves or in your place
we have distinguished the signs for a people who understand
and we send down out of heaven water and thereby we brought forth from it grains in clusters and from the pollen of dates hanging low and gardens and grapes olives and pomegranates similar in kind yet different in kind
look at the fruit thereof when it fruiteth and the reforming thereof
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
yet they ascribe to god as associates the creator of the heavens and the earth he created them and they set aside a part of them alike
hallowed be he and exalted above that which they associate
creator of the heavens and the earth how then he has no wife
he is the allknower of everything
such is allah your lord
la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he the creator of all things
he is guardian over everything
sights comprehend him not and he comprehendeth all sights
he is the subtle the aware
now there has come to you enlightenment from your lord and whosoever goes astray he is not at all responsible for his own loss
and i am not a guardian over you
thus we explain variously the ayat islamic monotheism so that they may say you have studied the books of the people of the scripture and brought it this quran by your own such as are signs for those who know
follow what has been inspired to you o muhammad saw from your lord la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he and turn aside from almushrikun
had god willed they would not have taken others besides him
and we have not made you a watcher over them nor are you set over them to dispose of their affairs
revile not those who bow in adoration with god and do not transgress
thus have we made attractive their deeds to every people
then to their lord is your return and he will tell them what they used to do
they solemnly swear by god if a sign comes to us we shall certainly believe in it if you are believers
say signs are with god and what do you not believe in him
we shall turn aside their hearts and their eyes walking at the time we shall leave them in their insolence wandering blindly
and had we sent down the angels towards them and the dead had we not sent down upon them and the dead spoken to them and had we willed would have not believed unless allah willed they would not have believed unless allah wills
but most of them know not
and similarly we have appointed enemies for every prophet and similarly the devils among men and jinns into different groups disputing with one another as their friends with one another and they order that they may plot
and if your lord had willed they would not have done so so leave them alone with their fabrications tafseer qurtubi vol
and in order that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it and that they may be pleased with it and that they may be pleased with it and that they may be doing
say shall i seek a judge other than god when he has sent down to you the book explained in detail
those to whom we gave the scripture jews and christians know that it is the truth from your lord
so be not you of those who doubt
and perfected is the word of thy lord in veracity and in justice
there is no changing the words of god
he is allhearing and allknowing
if you were to obey most of those on earth they would divert you from the path of god
they follow nothing but conjectures and they do nothing but lie
verily your lord it is he who knows best who strays from his way and he knows best who has gone astray from his way
so eat of that over which gods name is mentioned if you believe in his signs
what is the matter with you that you do not eat of that over which allah has explained to you in detail – that he has not permitted you to do what is forbidden to you except what is why should you then
and many others mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge
your lord certainly knows best the transgressors
discard both the visible and invisible sin
those who commit sin will get due recompense for what they used to commit
and eat not of that over which gods name has not been pronounced lying against you verily that is a departure
verily the satans are their friends in the unseen they ever going to gather you together
if you obey them you will be idolaters
is he who was dead and we quickened him and appointed for him a light whereby he walketh among mankind like unto him whose similitude is that he is in darknesses forth from which he can not come
thus it seems fair to the disbelievers and the oneness of allah is made fairseeming to the disbelievers that which they used to do
and thus we have set up in every town the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc
but they plot not except against their ownselves and they perceive it not
and when a sign comes to them they say we shall not believe until we are given the like of that which was given the like of that which gods messengers were given
allah knows best where to direct his messages
they will be severe in punishment because of their deeds and for them is a severe punishment
whomsoever allah wills to guide he opens his breast to islam and whomsoever he wills to send astray he makes his breast closed and constricted as if he is climbing up to the sky of the earth
thus allah puts the wrath on those who believe not
this is the straight path of your lord
we have distinguished the signs for a people who know
for them is an abode of peace with their lord
he is their wali helper and protector because of that which they used to do
on the day when he will gather them together he will gather them all together and ask o you about one of jinns
and indeed you love a great multitude from mankind
o lord many men and jinns and men
we benefited one from the other but now we have reached our appointed term which you did appoint for us
he will say the fire is your lodging therein to dwell forever except as god wills
and allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs allknower
verily your lord is wise knowing
and similarly we empower some of the oppressors over others – the recompense of their deeds
o you assembly of jinns and men
did not the noble messengers come to you from among you reciting my verses and warning you of confronting this day ”
they will say we bear witness against ourselves
the life of the world hath deluded them and they shall bear witness against themselves that verily they were unbelievers
that is because your lord would never destroy the populations of towns for their wrongdoing ie associating others in worship along with allah while their people were unaware
for all there will be degrees or ranks according to what they did
and your lord is not unaware of what they do
your lord is allsufficient merciful
if he wills he can take you away and make those of you who are righteous good deeds he will take you away from the offspring of your people and the one who will be repaid for what they used to do
verily that which you are promised ie resurrection in the hereafter and receiving the reward or punishment of good or bad deeds etc is surely true
say o muhammad saw o my people
work in happiness
say o muhammad saw to these polytheists and pagans etc
you will come to know who is the guerdon of life and who is the happy end in the hereafter
verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc shall not be successful
and they ll appoint for allah of the tilth and cattle he hath produced a portion they say according to their fancy this is for allah and this is for our associategods and theirs
so what is for their associates reaches not god and what is for god reaches their associates
how bad is the judgement that they make
and many of the mushrikun polytheists idolaters have done their killing overpowered and engulfed them
and had allah so willed they would not have done it
so leave them alone with their fabrications
and they say these cattle and crops are forbidden to them for things so that they may eat of that meat on which we have not yet joined them in their name on whom we will surely burn them and they will not be able to do so
and other animals we have forbidden them for any other men – eating of them – so such cattle as are forbidden and blood and cattle on the day of resurrection – they shall not eat from it and their beauty will be destroyed except those whom they will
they will say god
he will punish them for what they fabricate
and they say whatsoever is in the bellies of such cattle is in the bellies of such cattle and if it is in the earth they are all partners and if it is born from it they will then be their free movements in it
he will punish them for what they had done
he is the wise the knower
certainly lost are they who kill their children in folly without knowledge and killed in ignorance and forbid what allah has provided them inventing a lie against allah
they have gone astray and were not guided
and we have laid out of gardens trellised and untrellised palmtrees and crops of vines olives pomegranates like each to each and each unlike to each
so eat of their fruit when it fruiteth and give the due thereof on the day of its harvesting and waste not verily he approveth not the wasters
verily allah likes not almusrifun those who waste by extravagance
and of the cattle he hath created beasts of burden and small ones
eat of what god has provided for you and follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan verily he is to you an open enemy
eight couples two of sheep of goats two
say has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the females carry in their wombs
produce the sanction if you are truthful
and of the camels he hath created a twain and of the oxen a twain
say has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the two females carry in their wombs
and who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against allah
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
say thou i find not in that which hath been revealed unto me aught forbidden unto me is forbidden that which is forbidden unto me an eater that eateth thereof except that whereof is hallowed be carcass or blood poured forth hallowed be he aye is foul over that
but whosoever is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits for him certainly allah is oftforgiving most merciful
for those who are jews we forbade everything with claws
and unto those who are judaised we forbade every animal with cloven hoof and of the bullock and the goats we forbade unto them the fat thereof save that which is borne on their backs or entrails or that which sticketh to the bone
this is their recompense for their wickedness
we are truthful
and if they belie thee say thou your lord is owner of extensive mercy and his wrath shall not be turned aside from the people who are not to be wronged
and the polytheists will say had allah willed we would not have taken others besides him nor would we have forbidden aught
likewise did those before them
say have you any knowledge proof that you can produce before us
you follow nothing but conjecture and you only guess ”
say thou had allahs book been with allah he would have guided you all
say bring your witnesses those who can testify that god has forbidden all this
but if they testify testify do not you with them
and do not believe in the hereafter and they associate others with their lord
say o muhammad saw come i will recite what your lord has prohibited you from join not anything with him and abandon your children because of poverty we shall provide you and abandon your children out of fear for them and do not abandon your children because of poverty
we shall recite what is in your hearts so that you may not fear them nor will you approach them
and do not kill any living thing which allah has forbidden except in order to take not the just way allah has made it lawful and forbidden that you may take any person
and come not near to the orphans property except to improve it until he attains full strength and he who has been granted to his good
and establish the measures justly nor decrease the due weight
we charge not any soul save to its capacity
and when you speak be just even if it be that you speak in truth and fulfill your covenant with god
this he has commanded you that you may understand
and that is my straight path so follow it and follow not divers paths lest they follow it
and we have made you neglectful of prevent you from the sacred mosque and driving you out its guards
that then he has charged you with haply you will understand
then we gave moses the book before this and the last day and a guidance and a mercy to the children of israel that he may guide them
this is a book we have sent down blessed
so fear god and follow the right path that you may have mercy
lest you pagan arabs should say the book was only sent down to two sects before us and we were two parties jews and christians and we were not aware of their teachings
or lest you pagan arabs should say if only the book had been sent down to us we would surely have been better guided than they
say o muhammad saw proofs have come to you from your lord and a clear proof has come to you from your lord and a clear proof and who is more unjust than one who denies the signs of allah
anon we shall requite those who shun our signs with an evil chastisement
what are they waiting for except that the angels come to them or that your lord should come or that one of the signs of your lord should come
on the day when certain signs appear from your lord ’s punishment comes not from one who did not believe any good deeds by his own selves or earned it will come to faith
say wait you we too are waiting
verily those who have made divisions in their religion and become sects thou art not of them in aught their affair is only with allah he will tell them what they have done
then he will declare unto them that which they were wo nt to work
whoever brings a good deed islamic monotheism and brings an evil deed for him shall have ten times the like thereof and whosoever brings an evil deed shall have ten like thereof and they shall not be wronged a whit
say o muhammad saw my lord has guided me to a straight path a right religion the creed of abraham a man of pure faith he was not a idolater
say o muhammad saw verily my salat prayer my sacrifice my living and my dying are for allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
no associate hath he
even so i am commanded and i am the first of the muslims
say shall i seek a lord other than god while he is the lord of all things
each soul will be recompensed for that which it has earned
thereafter unto your lord shall you return and he shall tell you what you were at variance
and it is he who made you caliphs viceroys in the earth and ranked some of you high above others in order that he may test you with some of you indeed he has bestowed upon you and to test you with others
verily your lord is swift in retribution
he is the forgiving the merciful
alif
lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
sad
a book sent down to you so that you may warn your heart thereby and that you may warn the believers and that you may warn the people of makkah
follow what has been sent down to you from your lord and do not follow other administrators abandoning this the holy qur’an very clear proofs do not follow the holy qur’an very wicked deeds you do not follow the limits ordained by allah
little do you remember
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
why did they not humbly plead when our punishment came upon them at night or at day
then naught was their cry a when our might came upon them save that they said verily we were wrongdoers
we shall question those to whom we gave the book and question the apostles
we shall recount their deeds to them with knowledge and we shall not be absent
and the weighing on that day day of resurrection will be the true weighing
then as for him whose balances are heavy these they are the blissful ones
and as for those whose scales are light they have lost their souls because of what they have earned
and assuredly we settled you in the earth and provided therein ye with fruits as ye list verily there is of diverse colors
little thanks you give
and indeed we created you then designed you and then ordered the angels to prostrate before adam
except iblis he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves but iblis who refused was proud and was proud and was among the jinns disobedient to allah
said he what prevented thee to bow thyself when i commanded thee
he said i am better than he
he said i am better than he you created me from fire and him thou createdst of clay
said he get thee down out of it it is not for thee to wax proud here
as though they were asses startled
go and away you are one of the damned
said he respite me till the day they shall be raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
said he now because thou hast seduced me i shall beset them thy straight path
then i will come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right and from their left and you will not find most of them thankful
begone said god contemptible and rejected
i shall fill hell with you all together
and we said adam dwell thou and thy wife in paradise and eat ye twain plenteously therefrom as ye list but approach not yonder tree lest ye become of the wrongdoers
eat of that whereof ye eat not and eat an fill therewith your bellies and drink whomsoever ye are wrongdoers
let not satan tempt you as he brought you as well as he brought you out of your shameful parts and may expose their shame
and he swore to them truly i am unto you of the sincere ones
and led them astray by the tree of bitterness
then they tasted of their shame private parts became manifest to them and they began covering themselves with shame
and their lord called out to them “ did i not forbid you this tree and protect you from this tree ”
they said our lord
we have wronged ourselves
if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us we shall certainly be one of the losers
allah said get you down one of you an enemy to each other
for you is an enjoyment for a time and for a time ordained
he said therein you shall live and therein you shall die and from there you shall be brought forth
o descendants of adam
we have sent down to you the garment of nakedness and be an adornment and the garment of piety
this is among the signs of god that you may remember
o descendants of adam
let not satan tempt you as he brought you as he brought your parents out of paradise stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts
verily he and qabiluhu his soldiers from the jinns or his tribe see you from where you can not see them
we have made the satans the friends of those who do not believe
and when they commit an indecency they say we found our fathers practising it and god has commanded us to do it
say god does not command indecency what do you do
do you not know that you have no knowledge
say my lord has commanded justice and that you should be just
and set your face in every place of worship and call on him making your religion sincerely his
even as he began you ye shall be brought back
a section among them were guided by god and because they took the satans as their friends instead of the devils and they assume that god has made the devils the friends of the unbelievers glory
o descendants of adam
o people who believe
verily allah likes not almusrifun those who waste by extravagance
say who has forbidden the ornament of god which he has brought forth for his servants and the good things of provision
say these are they who will have a share in the life of the world and on the day of resurrection
thus do we explain variously the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for a people who reflect
say o muhammad saw my lord is not in the wrong and those who conceal what he sent down on them of a surety no warranty
for every nation is an appointed term when their term comes they can not stay at all nor can they advance it an hour or a moment
o descendants of adam
o ye who believe if there come unto you apostles from amongst you recounting my signs unto you then whosoever shall fear god and amend on them no fear shall come nor they grieve
and those who disbelieve and belie our signs and wax proud against them those shall be the fellows of the fire therein they shall be abiders
who does greater wrong than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
and when our messengers come to them with the book they shall say to their souls whom they used to take false deities other than allah and it is he who comes to them what is it that they used to call upon them
they will say “ we agree to our religion and they have turned away from you ”
allah will say enter you the fire among mankind who have passed away before you of genii and mankind
every time a crowd enters it will curse every after its death comes to the one of the dwellers of the fire and the first of them will say our lord
and they have led us astray
he said “ each person each one of us is a promise but god does not know what you do ”
the first of them will say to the last of them taste the torment of the first time and after its torment will be that you were promised
verily those who belie our signs and are stiffnecked against them for them will not enter the garden until the camel goes through the needle which is impossible
thus do we requite the people who are mujrimun disbelievers polytheists sinners criminals etc
for them is a couch of hell and above them is a covering
thus we requite the wrongdoers
but those who believe and do deeds of righteousness those are the inhabitants of paradise therein dwelling forever
we charge not any soul save to its capacity
we shall strip away all rancour that is in their breasts as brothers
rivers flowing beneath them
and they will say all the praises and thanks be to allah who has guided us to our ways
had it not been that allah had guided us we would have indeed been guided
they will say “ indeed the promise of our lord had come to us ”
this is what you were doing
and the dwellers of paradise will call to the dwellers of the fire verily we have found our lord the true promise which our lord had promised us
say have you also found true what your lord had promised you
they will say yes
a party of them said verily the curse of allah is upon the wrongdoers
those who hindered others from the way of allah and would seek to render it crooked and in the herafter they were disbelievers
and between them is a barrier screen and on alaraf a wall will be men with elevated places and by their marks black faces by the dwellers of paradise by their faces and the dwellers of paradise salamun alaikum peace be upon you by the angels who cut off
they have not entered it yet they do not believe
and when their eyes are turned towards the inhabitants of the fire they will say “ our lord do not make us one of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoing people ”
and the dwellers on the battlements shall call to certain men they know by their sign your amassing has not availed you of what your souls desired
are these the people of the three they swore that allah would not have mercy on them at all – and at all those who are true believers
it will be said to them enter paradise where you will not be recompensed but what an excellent recompense
on you shall be no fear nor shall you grieve
and the dwellers of the fire will call to the dwellers of paradise pour on us some provision or give us some sustenance which allah has given you
they will say god has forbidden them to the unbelievers
who took their religion as a sport and a play and whom the life of the world beguiled
so today we shall forget them even as they forgot their meeting of this day and as they were ever gainsaying our signs
and we gave them the book the quran in which we have brought them a book detailed according signs and a guidance and a mercy unto a people who believe
but they will not be able to intercede for him except with his will
the day when the result foretold by it occurs those who had previously forgotten it from the beginning the disbelievers will exclaim “ indeed the noble messengers of our lord had brought the truth
or have we any intercessors who can intercede with us
or could we be able to turn back from our gods even if we were to become the first to destroy it
they are indeed lost in this world and they have lost their souls and that they used to fabricate
surely your lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six days then he istawa rose over the throne in a manner that suits his majesty
it is he who made the sun the moon to a dry by night and day whose sun runs to its course for its course comes up the moon
verily the creation and the creation is sure to happen
blessed be god the lord of all being
call on your lord humbly and privately
he does not love the iniquitous
and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed and pray to him in awe and expectation
verily allah is near to the muhsinun gooddoers see v 2112
it is he who sends the winds with auspicious news in advance of his benevolence and we drive it towards a dead land and restore the earth after it had died
even so we shall bring the dead to life
so that you may remember
and the good land its herbage cometh forth by the command of its lord and that which is vile it cometh forth only scantily
thus do we explain variously the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for a people who give thanks
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people – he therefore said “ o my people
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
the leaders of his people replied we see you in plain error
he said o my people
he said no error is but an apostle from the lord of the worlds
i preach unto you the messages of my lord and i councel you good and i know from allah which ye know not
what do you wonder that a reminder from your lord should come to you by the lips of a man from among you that he may warn you and that you may fear god and that you may be treated with mercy
but they cried him lies so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and we drowned those who cried lies to our signs
they were certainly wicked people
and to ad people we sent their brother hud
he said o my people
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
will you not then hear
the chiefs of those who disbelived among his people said verily we deem thee in folly and verily we deem thee to be of the liars
he said o my people
there is no foolishness in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
“ and i convey unto you the messages of my lord and am your trustworthy wellwisher ”
do you wonder that a warning has come to you from among you by way of faith and that he may warn you
and remember when he made you successors after the people of nuh noah he made you successors after them and raised you above them
remember the favour of allah which he restored you to the romans against the persians and obtain diversion not fear allah so that you may thrive
they said “ you forbid us from worshiping what our parents and your fathers used to worship ”
then bring us that thou promisest us if indeed thou speakest truly
he said “ anger and wrath have fallen upon you from your lord
what do you dispute with me regarding names you have named you and your fathers touching which god has sent down never authority
and watch
so wait i am waiting with you
so we saved him and those with him by a mercy from us and we cut off the last remnant of those who cried lies to our signs and were not believers
and to thamood their brother salih he said o my people serve god
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
o mankind there hath come unto you a convincing proof prophet muhammad saw from your lord
this is the greatest blessing upon you
this is a painful punishment
remember when you were few and powerless in the land afraid of despoliation at the hands of men
and you have made various kinds of alcoholic drink and gambling
remember ye wherefore the benefits of the people of the world and commit not evil on the earth as corrupters
the chiefs of those who were stiffnecked amongst his people said unto those who were counted weak unto such of them as believed know ye that salih saleh and those who believed behold ye that salih is a sent from his lord
they said we believe in that with which he has been sent
those who were arrogant answered we do not believe in what you believe in
then they hamstrung her and on the morrow were repentant and he made the shecamel a mere body
so bring us what you promise us if what you promise us
so the earthquake seized them and they lay dead prostrate in their homes
saleh therefore turned away from them and said “ o my people
and assuredly i have vouchsafed unto you the messages of my lord and counselled you good but ye approve not in the good
and we sent lut – the messengers
and remember lout lot when he said to his people commit you such as never commit the shameful such as you commit an indecency as never in the alamin mankind and jinns before you in the past
what do you approach men lustfully instead of women
nay but you are a people who behave senselessly
but the only answer of his people was that they said expel them from your city they are folk that do corruption
we therefore rescued him and his family except his wife we had decreed that she is one of those who will stay behind
and we rained down on them a rain of stones
so behold what like was the end of the sinners
and to midian their brother shuaib he said o my people serve god
he said o my people
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
and give full measure and weight with equity from your lord and do not defraud people of their things and commit not mischief in the land causing corruption
that is better for you if you are believers
and sit not on every road threatening and hindering from the path of allah those who believe in him and seeking to make it crooked
and remember when you were few and he multiplied you in the land
so behold what like hath been the end of the corruptors
and if there be a party of you who believeth in that wherewith i have been sent with and a party who do not believe in that which i have been sent with and patience till allah judgeth between us and me
and he is the best of judges
the leaders of those who were arrogant among his people replied we will expel you from our land o shuaib and those who have believed with you unless you return into our faith
he said what shall we follow our land or else we shall go forth with our land
it is not for us to return to your religion that we may return to it
it is not for us to return into it unless god our lord will
our lord embraces all things in his knowledge
in god we put our trust
our lord
our lord make no distinction between us and our people is the best of the judges
the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said if you follow shuaib and his people will be losers you
so the earthquake seized them and they lay dead prostrate in their homes
as if they had denied shuaib shuaib shuaib does not let them laugh at the high place of stay in their midst
but they cried lies and were lost in the scale of those who were destroyed by a wind clamorous
he shuaib turned from them and said o my people
i preach unto you the messages of my lord and i am unto you a counseller faithful
and never did we send a warner to any city except its men who lived at ease therein
then we took fair to them in the way of evil and they said we are more numerous in riches and children and more
so we seized them suddenly unawares
and had the people of the towns believed and the noble messengers had believed in the qur’an and the angels had we surely have opened the blessings from the heavens and the earth and the mountains would have been better than them
they belied the messengers wherefore we laid hold of them for that which they were wo nt to earn
are the people of the townships then secure that our wrath would not come upon them at night while they are slumbering
or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of our might in the hours of the morning they remain engrossed in sport and play
are they oblivious of allah ’s secret plan
god is aware of the things you do
did those who inherited the earth after its owners get the guidance from their sins if we pleased we can afflict them with a painful punishment
these towns — we narrate to you some of their tales
there came unto them their apostles with evidences but they were not such as to believe that which they had erst belied
thus doth allah put a seal upon the hearts of the infidels
we did not break their covenant with them
and most of them follow their footsteps
then after them we sent moosa with our signs to firaun and his court members so they did believe in them
so behold what like hath been the end of the corruptors
and musa moses said o firaun pharaoh
i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
but my duty is only to god
i have come to you with a clear proof from your lord
so send forth with me the children of israel
he said if you have brought a sign then display it if what you say is true
so he cast his staff and behold it was a serpent manifest
and he drew forth his hand and lo it was white unto the beholders
the chiefs of the people of firawn said verily this is a magician knowing
he wishes to drive you out of your land by his magic
so what do you advise
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send summoners to the cities to gather
to bring you every cunning sorcerer
and the magicians came to firaun and said “ will we get some reward if we are victorious ”
he said yes and moreover you will in that case be of the nearest to me
they said o musa moses
they said “ do you throw first – or we throw them into a magic spell ” so when they threw terror into separate them and they threw terror into their hearts and they said “ do we know what they have spoken ”
he said you cast
and when they cast clown they enchanted the eyes of the people and terrified them and brought mighty magic to bear
and we revealed to moses cast his staff
and lo it forthwith swallowed up their lying invention
so the truth was proved and their works came to naught and they found their works have failed
so they were defeated there and then and were returned disgraced
and the magicians flung themselves prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of the worlds
musa moses said o harun aaron
firaun pharaoh said you have believed in him before i gave you leave
this is a plot you have hatched to expel the people from the land you may expel its people from it
you will come to know
i will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of datepalm trees
they said “ we will return to our lord ”
you only have believed in the signs of our lord when they came to us
our lord
our lord pour out patience upon us and bestow us death as muslims
the chieftains of firaun ’s people said “ are you releasing moosa and his people to cause turmoil in the land and your deities ”
he said “ we will now slay their sons and spare their women and we are masters over them ”
moses said to his people pray “ pray for help in god and be firm in devotion
verily allah is the earth
he gives of his slaves as he wills of his bounty blessings
the future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
they said we have been oppressed before you came to us
and musa moses said belike your lord will destroy your enemy and establish yougs in their stead in the land thathe may see what wise ye work
and assuredly we laid hold of the people of firawn with lean years and lack of fruits that haply they might dread
and when good came to them they said “ this is for us ” and when an evil way they ascribed it to their own harm and they said “ this is for us ”
surely god is with him but most of them do not know
they said whatsoever sign thou bringest unto us of the nature of a sign wherewith to enchant us in thee we are not going to be believers
and we sent against them the flood of locusts the lice and the frogs and the blood signs detailed yet they remained stiffnecked
but they behaved arrogantly and were mujrimun polytheists sinners disbelievers in the oneness of allah polytheists sinners criminals etc folk
and when the punishment fell on them they said o musa moses
call on your lord for us
if you lift the punishment from us we shall indeed take revenge from you
consequently whenever we lifted the punishment from them for a term which they must reach they used to then turn away
and we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea for rejecting our signs and not heeding them
and we made the people who were weak and oppressed successors of the land and the east and the west which we had blessed
and we made the children of israel in the dwelling of firaun pharaoh and his people had destroyed all the bad deeds of pharaoh and what they were doing
and we brought the children of israel across the sea and they came upon a people who were devoted to their idols they said “ o our lord
they said o musa moses
they said “ o moosa
he said “ you are indeed an ignorant people ”
that is because they are cried lies to and the false is what they practise
he said what shall i seek for you a god other than god
and remember when we rescued you from firaun ’s people who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters and in it was a trial from your lord
in that was a great trial from your lord
and we treated with him thirty nights and we completed them with ten so we completed them with ten nights
and musa moses said to his brother harun aaron replace me among my people act with truth and do not follow the way of the authors of evil
and when musa came at our appointment and his lord spake unto him he said my lord shew thyself unto me that i may look at thee
he said you can not see me but look at the mountain if it remains firm in its place you will not see me
he said you can not see me but look at the mountain if it remains firm in its place you will surely see me
he said “ you will see me – in the fire ”
then when his lord unveiled his glory to the mount it turned it to dust and again
and when he recovered his senses he said glory be to you
so when he awoke he said glory be to thee
i turn to you in penitence and submit
he said “ o moosa
i have chosen you above all beings
so now that i may give thee and be grateful
and we wrote for him on the tablets of everything an exhortation and a detail with him
we shall show you the signs but you will not believe in the oneness of allah and also to show you the signs
i shall turn away from my signs and wax proud in the earth unjustly though they see every sign they will not believe in them until they see the signs of the chastisement
and if they see the way of guidance we shall indeed make it clear to them they will see the truth and they will not believe in it and they see the way of error
those who deny our signs and the meeting in the hereafter – so the deeds of those who denied our signs are made to appear good to them
will they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did
and ehe people of musa after him took of their trinkets a calf a body with a low
did they not see that it was not guide them to the right path
they took it for worship and they chose it
and when they saw the twain they said “ if our lord had not mercy on us and forgive us we shall surely be lost ”
and when moses returned to his people angry and sorrowful he said evilly have you done in my place after me what is your work
why did you hasten the decree of your lord
and he cast down the tablets and laid hold of his brothers head dragging him to him
and his brother harun aaron
he said verily my lord hath despised me
do not put me among the people who are the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoing ie do not make my enemies to gloat over me and put me not among the people of the evildoers
he said my lord
forgive me and my brother and make us enter into your mercy and forgive us and my brother and enter us into your mercy
verily those who took the calf anon will overtake them indignation from their lord and abasement in the life of the world
thus we require the fabricators
and those who do evil deeds then repent thereafter and believe surely thy lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
and when he anger abated in him he took the tablets and in the inscription thereon were guidance and mercy unto these who hold their lord
and moses chose seventy of his people for our appointed time and when the earthquake seized them he said o my lord hadst thou willed thou wouldst have destroyed them afore and me
if you do not have any knowledge of us you could have annihilated them
that is because you are the kingdom of the allmighty the allknowing
and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy on us for you are the best of forgivers
forgive us and have mercy on us for you are the best of the merciful
and ordain for us good in the world and in the hereafter verily we have been guided
he said “ my punishment is only one of those who are honoured ”
and i shall prescribe for them but those who believe in god and the faithful who affirm the offerings and those who believe in our signs and do good for them we shall pay them in full for them we shall pay the alms and those who believe in
those who follow the noble messenger muhammad saw in the book the holy prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is a noble messenger who reads the pure pages
and we said to the people who did not reveal the matter that is in their hearts and we have made the noble messengers a son of allah and the good news of the coming of the fire of hell and the disbeliever was not in their hearts any
those who believe in him and what has been revealed to him and in the light it is they who are the losers
say o mankind
verily allah is the lord of the heavens and the earth
he gives life and causes death
and why should you believe in god and his messenger and the last day and be among you come to know that you will be guided
and of the people of musa moses there is a community guiding others by the truth and judging thereby
and we cut them up into twelve tribes as communities
then gushed forth therefrcm twelve springs every people already knew their drinkingplaces
and we shaded them with thick clouds and we sent down upon them the manna and the quails saying eat of the clean things wherewith we have provided you
and they worked no wrong upon us but themselves they wronged
and when it was said to them dwell in this land and eat of it wherever you wish and say unburdening and enter in at the gate prostrating we shall forgive you your transgressions and increase in the gooddoers
but the evildoers among them substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them so we sent down upon them a plague from the sky because of their disobedience
and they did not expect to be informed of their dwellings
thus we tried them because they disobeyed
and when a group among them said “ why do you preach to a people whom allah will punish him severely ” he said “ why do you preach to a people whom he will with a painful punishment ”
so when they forgot that they were reminded of we delivered those who prohibited evil and we seized the evildoers with a dreadful chastisement
so when they exceeded the bounds of that which they were prohibited we said unto them be ye apes despised
and recall what time thy lord proclaimed that he would surely raise them on the day of resurrection someone perpetrating on them worst oppression
and verily your lord is swift in chastising and verily he is forgiving merciful
and we cut them up into communities on the earth
and among them are some who wrong themselves
and we tried them with good blessings and evil calamities in order that they might turn to allahs obedience
then after them we raised a new generation inherited the book
and they sought the countenance of the world after the death thereof and we shall set them thereafter unto them repentant and verily we shall be succoured the ones
and if they come to them their own souls will be like unto them
did they not say about god anything but the truth
and they have read the qur’an in the hereafter
and the home of the hereafter is better for those who fear straying from the right path
will you not then understand
and as for those who adhere to the book and are firm in devotion we shall certainly not let them be lost in respect of their deeds
and recall what time we shook the mountain over them as if it were a canopy and they imagined that it was going to fall on them and we sent down upon them the book that was with them and we strengthened you with a book that was given
and recall what time thy lord took from the children of adam from their loins their seed and make them testify touching themselves that they were witnesses upon themselves
they said nay we are really afraid that thou mayest be dead
and we were unaware of what you did and we did not say on the day of resurrection nor did we think that you are partners in worship with allah
or lest you should say it was my fathers who associated afore and after them we shall not be thereafter after them had come to us
and we were unaware of what you did and we did not say on the day of resurrection nor did we think that you are partners in worship with allah
thus we explain variously the ayat islamic monotheism that they may turn back their religion islamic monotheism
and recite to them the news of the man who denied our signs so we gave him wisdom and then he became one of the perverts
and if we willed we could have elevated it
and we willed he would have elevated him on the earth but he clung to the ground and followed his own desires
this is the case of the people who deny our signs
so relate the stories perhaps they may reflect
vile is that they shall belie our signs and that which they belied
and whomsoever allah guides he is the guided and whomsoever he sendeth astray those they are the losers
and assuredly we have created many of the jinns and men and they have hearts wherewith they understand not
they are but like cattle nay they are further astray
they are the heedless ones
to him belong the attributes most beautiful
nun
for they will be punished for what they had done
and of those whom we have created there is a community who guides others with the truth and establishes justice therewith
and those who belie our signs step by step we lead them on in a way they know not
and i will give them respite
my plan is certainly invincible
have they not reflected no madness is in their comrade
he is but a plain warner
have they not contemplated the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything created by god to educe that perhaps their own term is drawing to a close
in what discourse then will they believe
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there shall be no guide
and he destroyed them with their wickedness and they were unable to go in their insolence blindly wandering in their exorbitance
they ask you o muhammad peace be upon him about the hour when will be its appointed time
say the knowledge thereof is with my lord alone
none can reveal its time except he
heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth
it will come upon you suddenly
they ask you as if you were in the matter of the king asked him “ you have a good place of war ”
say the knowledge thereof is with god alone but most men do not know
say i have no power to profit for myself or hurt but as god may please
if i had the knowledge of the unseen i would have acquired much good and evil would have touched me
i am naught but a warner and a bringer of glad tidings unto a people who believe
it is he who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and propagated among the livestock he sent down for you
then when she conceived a light she screened herself from her and prayed for us to give us a salih good if you bestow us a healthy son
but when he had given them a salih good in every aspect child they ascribed partners to him allah has given them allah in that which he has given them high ranks
hallowed be allah from that which they ascribe to him
do they associate those who can not create a thing and are themselves created
and they have no power to help themselves nor can they help themselves
and if you call them to guidance they follow you not
and if you call them to account you are promised it or to reckon it is all the same to you
verily those whom you call upon besides allah are slaves like you
so call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful
or do they have feet to walk with or have they ears to hear with say call upon your ascribed partners to allah and conspire against me and do not give me no respite
my saviour is god who has revealed this book and has revealed the book to you
and he is a friend who takes care
and those whom they call upon apart from him can not help them
and if you call them to guidance they do not hear and you see them looking at you yet they do not see
show forgiveness enjoin what is good and turn away from the foolish ie do nt punish them
and if an evil whisper from shaitan satan tries to turn you away and then seek refuge in allah
he is allhearing and allknowing
and when the godfearing is surely from allah a visitation of satan troubles them and an admonition
and their brethren drag them on toward error so they stop not short
and if you do not bring them a miracle according to their ie quraishpagans proposal they say why have you not brought it
say i follow only what is revealed to me from my lord
this is clear proofs from your lord and proofs and evidence and he will guide them to a straight path
and when the qur’an is recited listen to it attentively and keep silent so that you receive mercy
and remember your lord within yourself humbly and fearfully and quietly in the morning and the evening and the morning and the morning and the evening and the morning and the brains – and you are not of those who do not be neglectful
verily those who are with thy lord wax not too proud to serve him they chant his praise and evening and the rites of the sides bow in homage to him
they ask you about the spoils of war say god knows the spoils and the messenger
so fear allah and adjust all matters of difference among you and obey allah and his messenger muhammad saw if you are believers
the believers are those who when god is mentioned their hearts quake and when his signs are recited to them they put their faith in their faith and put their trust in their lord
those who keep the prayer established and spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them
are they the people of the truth
for them are grades of dignity with their lord and forgiveness and a generous provision paradise
as your lord brought you out from your home with the truth and indeed a group of believers were averse
disputing with thee respecting the right cause after it had become quite clear as though they were looking at it
and recall what time allah promised you two the one of the two parties was about to lose heart or to strengthen your faith and he willed that he might justify you by his enjoyment in the life of this world
and allah justifieth the truth according to his words even though the infidels detest
in order that he may prove the truth and disprove falsehood even if the criminals get annoyed
when you appealed to your lord for help he answered you “ i will help you with a thousand angels in succession ”
god made it not save as a guidance and glad tidings for your hearts that your hearts thereby may be at rest therewith
and there is no victory except from allah
god is mighty and wise
when he had sent down rain from the sky to you he sent down the shechina upon you and he rewarded you with a legions you did not see and he made the sky and he sent down the hearts of the tree of the sky and he made
and remember when your lord inspired the angels “ i am with you so keep firm those who have been sent with you ”
those who believe and confound not their belief with their belief
i fear the unbelievers
so smite them on their necks and every joint and incapacitate them
this is their judgment and to be seen of them
and whosoever opposes allah and his messenger muhammad saw then verily allah is severe in punishment
this taste it then and that for its torment is the torment of the fire
o you who believe
o believers fight the unbelievers who are unbelievers
and if any man should remember that allah will not purify him and those who are on a day of resurrection let him who is in security and allah will not purify himself from disbelief by sending any way and allah is ever rich knowing the things you do
you killed them not but god did so
you did not slay them but god slew them and thou thrtwest not when he threw them into something when god has delivered the believers
verily allah is hearing knowing
that is so and that god weakens the unbelievers guile
but if you desire a verdict has come to you
and if you return we shall do your return and if you return we shall do it
and we strengthened you with years among you that you might not be able to do anything
o you who believe
and obey allah and his noble messenger and do not turn away from him after you have heard him speak
and be not like those who say we hear whereas they hearken not
verily the worst of moving living creatures with allah are those who are deaf and dumb and devoid of sense
and had allah known in them any good he would surely have made them hear and had he made them hear they would have turned away in obduracy
o you who believe
o believers respond to god and his messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life and know that god stands between a man and his heart and that you will be gathered before him and that you will be gathered
and fear the fitnah affliction and trial etc which affects not in particular only those of you who do wrong and the earth and the wrongdoers among you not in any trial except with a punishment that is because of allah and allah is severe
and remember when you were weak in the land and in the land and in order that you might be superior to you in strength and in order that you may be grateful
o you who believe
betray not allah and his messenger nor betray knowingly your amanat things entrusted to you and all the duties which allah has ordained for you
and know that your wealth and your children are a trial and that with allah is a mighty hire
o you who believe
if you are grateful he will give you your sins and will forgive you your sins
and allah is the owner of great bounty
and recall what time the infidels were plotting against thee or to confine thee or to slay thee or to slay thee or to slay thee and allah was plotting and allah was the best of plotters
and when our verses of the quran are recited to them they say we have heard
we could not change this even as the ancients
naught is this but fables of the ancients
and remember when they said o muhammad saw
and if this the book is really the truth from you then rain down stones from the sky or bring us a painful torment from the sky
and allah would not punish them while you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are amongst them nor allah punish them with their injustice and allah is not one to take revenge
and why should allah not punish them while they are not going to stop the sacred mosque while they are going to kill those who have been going to stop short good nor they say why do they not allah
only the wretch will turn aside
but most of them know not
their salat prayer at the house of allah is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands
taste then the torment for ye were to disbelieve
those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order to hinder people from the way of allah and then they will become regretful
thereafter after that a season
and those who disbelieve will be pushed into hell
in order that allah may distinguish the vile from the good and shall place the foolish ones
they are the losers
say to the unbelievers if they give over the unbelievers what they have done then there is no sin on them if they give over we shall be forgiven
and fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief and polytheism ie worshipping others besides allah and all and every kind of worship will be done to allah alone
but if they cease worshipping others besides allah then certainly allah is allseer of what they do
but if they turn away then know that allah is your master and what an excellent maula patron lord helper and protector etc what an excellent protector an excellent helper
and know that whatever you have taken a fifth of booty in allah and his noble messenger and to take place your trust in allah and his noble messenger and the last day if you indeed believe in allah and his noble messenger and the last day he will
and allah is able to do all things
and remember when you were on the near bank and they were on the farther side ie the caravan below you
and had allah willed he would have vindicated himself after he after he had slain them in order that he might prove you by that he might prove the truth and that he may prove the truth by that which was in your graves
verily allah is hearing knowing
and recall what time allah shewed them few unto thee in thy dream if he had shown them to thee in your dream as many ye would have been discouraged and you would surely have surely sure faith in the sight of the world
but god saved you by his mercy
verily he is the allknower of the innermost secrets of the breasts
and when you met the army in ad the disbelievers he made you appear fewer in their eyes that he may conclude a predetermined matter that was done so that god sees the things you had done
and to allah return all matters for decision
o you who believe
and when you meet an enemy force take a firm stand up in order that you may be successful
and obey allah and his noble messenger and do not dispute with one another lest you lose courage and your strength depart and be patient
verily allah is with the patient
and be not like those who went forth from their habitations swaggering boastfully to show off to men and barring from gods way and god encompasses the things they do
and when he had decked out their deeds to them and he has exalted you over all men
i am indeed a herald of warning you and i am the messenger of allah to bestow a clear message upon you
i see what you are pressing upon
verily i fear allah the torment of the day of resurrection
and allah is severe in punishment
and when tile hypocrites and those in whose hearts is sickness said their religion is only a delusion and whosoever believes in god and his messenger is god mighty and wise
and whosoever relieth on allah then verily allah is mighty wise
if you could see the angels draw near of their faces and their backs smiting their faces and their backs taste the torment of burning
this is because of that which your hands have sent forth and verily allah is not unjust to his slaves
like the ways of firaun ’s people and those before them they disbelieved in the signs of allah – allah seized them because of their sins and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
verily allah is allstrong severe in punishment
that is because they are a people who do not change what is in their hearts unless they change a favour having their own people have changed what is in themselves and because they are a people until they alter the words of allah and allah is all hearing
like the ways of firaun ’s people and those before him and these towns – we destroyed them because of their sins and we drowned the people of firaun pharaoh and all their sins
so we drowned the firaun and all his people in the sea
they were all wicked
the worst of beasts in gods sight are the people who are the deaf and dumb –
those with whom you made a treaty then they break their agreement each time and do not fear
so if you gain the mastery over them in war punish them severely in order to disperse those who are behind them so that they may learn a lesson
and if you apprehend treachery from a people whom you have a treaty retaliate by breaking off relations with them
and allah likes not the treacherous
and let not those who disbelieve assume that they have never gone astray
they will never be able to save themselves from allahs punishment
and when you see them up in the least of god is able to stretch up your hands up against them as god will exalt your ranks and rid you of what you do
and whatever you spend in the cause of allah will be repaid to you in full and you will not be dealt with unjustly
but if they incline to peace you also incline towards it and put your trust in god
he is allhearing and allknowing
and if they seek to deceive you then indeed allah is sufficient for you
he it is who aided thee with his succour and with the believers
and allah has united their ie believers hearts
and he had united their ie believers hearts together with full submission to allah
he is allmighty and allwise
o prophet muhammad saw
god suffices thee and those who believe with the believers who follow thee
o prophet muhammad saw
urge the believers to fight
if there are twenty of you with determination they will vanquish two hundred and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers for they are a people who do not understand
god has lightened your burden as you know who has gone forth in succession
allah knows that if there are two hundred of you they will overcome two hundred and if there be a thousand of you they will overcome two thousand by the leave of allah and allah is mighty lord
and allah is with the patient
it behoveth not a prophet that he should have captives until he hath greatly slaughtered in the land
you desire the vanities of this world but god wills for you the reward of the world to come and god is allmighty and allwise
had it not been for a prior prescription from god there had afflicted you for what you took a mighty chastisement
so eat of what you have been lawful and good and fear god
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o prophet muhammad saw
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ if allah finds any good in your hearts he will give you better than what has been taken from you and will give you better than you in full
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and if they intend to deceive you then he has overpowered them and allah has given you power over them
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of god with their possessions and their selves and their selves are not allies
those who believed and emigrated not you have naught against you except those who emigrate yet if they emigrate yet help them they will not help you
and allah is allseer of what you do
and the disbelievers said to the muslims “ if you do not help one another you will not be able to retaliate ”
those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of god with their possessions and their selves and those who have given wealth and soul in the way of god are the friends of one another
for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
and those who believed afterwards and emigrated and strove hard along with you in the cause of allah they are of you
verily allah is of everything knower
freedom from all obligations is declared from allah and his messenger saw to those of the mushrikun polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of allah with whom you made a treaty
go about freely in the land for four months and know that god is not like you
this is a great evidence from allah and his messenger to mankind on the day of resurrection he will forgive you your sins and allah is most merciful
if you repent it is better for you but if you turn away then know that you can not escape from allahs punishment
and give thou good tidings to the unbelievers of a painful chastisement
except those of the mushrikun with whom you have a treaty who have not subsequently failed you in aught nor have they found your oaths a treaty
fulfill their treaty
verily allah loveth the godfearing
then when the sacred months have slipped away slay the associatorss wheresoever ye find them and capture them and beset them and lie in wait for them at every ambush
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then let them go their way
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and if one of them desires to stand up to thee then place him in place of security then he will place him in security
that is because they are a people who know not
how can there be a treaty with allah and his noble messenger except for those with whom you made a treaty
so if they turn away say to them you should not be guided
verily allah loveth the godfearing
how can they prevail against you even if they fight you they will not have regard you at all
they will not listen to you with their mouths
and most of them are transgressors
god presents the example of a little and they do not sell it for a little price
verily vile is that which they have been working
they respect not either kinship or agreement in a believer
they are the losers
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms then they are your brethren in faith
thus do we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc in detail
and if they break their oaths after they break their covenant after they have believed and thrust at their religion then fight they have no faith
and do you not fight those who broke their promises and intended to expel the noble messenger while they had started it
do you fear them
god is more equitable in the hearts of believers if you are believers
and fight them in the way of god and he will punish them at your hands and he will remove the rage of their hearts and he will pardon them and will humiliate them with the repentance of the believers
and he will take away their rage
god redeems whomever he wills
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
or did you suppose you would be left in peace and god knows not as yet tested those of you who have taken as a friend apart from god and his messenger and the believers
and allah is allaware of what you do
god does not lead the idolaters to the mosque on their holy mosque preventing the offerings from arriving of sacrifice
their works have failed now they are in the fire they are in vain
only those who believe in god and the last day perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and believe in god and the last day fear none but god
belike those will be of the guided ones
do they consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of almasjidalharam at makkah as believing in allah and the last day and strive hard and fight in the cause of allah with their wealth and the cause of allah
they are not equal in allah ’s sight
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of god with their possessions and their selves
they are the successful
their lord announces to them news of his mercy acceptance and gardens of lasting bliss
they will abide in it for ever
verily with allah is a great reward
o you who believe
take not your fathers and brothers as friends if they prefer disbelief to belief
and whosoever of you then befriendeth them then those they are the wrongdoers
say if your fathers your sons your wives your sons your brothers your wives your tribe and your acquired wealth and the trade and the commerce that you fear may be tried by mutual consent and do not seek forgiveness from allah and his messenger then wait until allah
and allah guides not the people who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
god indeed has helped you on many occasions before you on the day of hunain when your multitude was pleasing killing your enemy you turned back on your heels and the battle of badr but you were lost in your homes
then allah sent down his sakinah calmness tranquillity peace etc upon the believers and sent down forces angels which you saw not and punished them with the disbelievers
such is the recompense of disbelievers
then after that allah will accept the repentance of whom he wills and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
o you who believe
that is the associators
but the mushrikun polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of allah after the messenger muhammad saw are najasun impure
if you fear poverty god will enrich you if he will out of his bounty if he will he will of bounty
god is allknowing and allwise
fight against those who 1 believe not in allah 2 nor in the last day 3 nor forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger 4 and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth ie islam among the people of the scripture jews and christians
the jews say ezra is the son of god the christians say christ is the son of god
that is a saying from their mouths
they imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old
may allah confound them by their truthfulness and they will be punished in the least
how then are they deviating
and those they worship besides allah idols and whom they have not sent down any proof of the sinners
there is no god but he
high be he exalted above that they associate with him
they want to extinguish the light of god by uttering blasphemies but god will not have it so pleasing to the unbelievers
it is he who has sent his noble messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that he may uplift it above every religion though the unbelievers be averse
o you who believe
many of the rabbis and the priests devour the possessions of others wrongfully and keep others away from the way of god
those who treasure up gold and silver and do not expend them in the way of god announce thou unto them a torment afflictive
on the day when they will be heated in the fire of hell and their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with them “ this is what you hoarded for yourselves so now taste what you used to hoard ”
taste then the torment because you used to disbelieve
the number of months with god is twelve in accordance with gods law since the day he created the heavens and the earth
that is the right religion
so wrong not yourselves during the nights and in public except in case they are sacred
and fight them totally even as they fight you totally and know that god is with the godfearing
the unbelievers are misguided by this for they will surely take their number although they may be forbidden to one year and sacrilegious the next next next by number of months sanctified by god accord with holy fighting during the holy month and struggles in the way of disbelief
the evil of their deeds seems pleasing to them
and allah guides not the people who disbelieve
o you who believe
and what is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of allah ie jihad in the land they say you have become arrogant
are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the hereafter
and ornaments of the life of this world is but meagre as compared with the life to come
if he wills he can put you away and bring other people a painful torment
and you can not harm him and allah is able to do all things
if you do not help him then know that god has helped him when the unbelievers drove him out to him he surely sees him
when he saw them not and said to his brother god will help you against the unbelievers with no help of the unbelievers
but god is allmighty and allwise
march forth light and heavy and strive hard in the cause of allah with your riches and your lives
that is better for you if you only knew
and if the near relations are close at hand and the poor – and the wayfarer a small band and if it were a near relatives we would surely have certainly accompanied you but the difficult path became indeed the disbelievers lost
and they will say if we had the strength we would not have been with you
they are only ruining themselves for god is aware they lie
god has forgiven you
why should i not ask you for it was that the truthful and the truth and the liars although he has given them leave
those who believe in god and the last day would not ask your leave to be excused from striving hard with their riches and their lives
and allah is the allknower of the muttaqun pious see v 22
only they ask for leave who believe not in god and the last day and whose hearts are in doubt that they ask your leave
and if they had intended to march out they would have made some preparation for it but allah was averse to their wending wherefore he withheld them and the word was passed and it was said to them sit at home with those who stay behind
had they gene forth with you they would have added unto you naught save unsoundness and they would surely have hurried about in your midst seeking sedition unto you and amongst you there would have hurried about in your midst seeking a cause of you and amongst you and
and allah is the allknower of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
indeed they had sought to cause you to turn about and you were mischievous great matters
and among them is he who says “ give me permission and do not trouble me ”
lo verily they they have fallen into trial
surely gehenna encompasses the unbelievers
if good befalls you it grieves them but if some evil overtakes you they say we wish you good but if calamity befalls them they turn away and still they turn away rejoicing
say nothing shall befall us except what allah has decreed for us he is our protector in allah
he is our maula lord helper and protector etc in him let us put their trust
and in allah let believers put their trust
say thou await ye for us ought except for our eyes or iron
so wait we too are waiting with you
say thou expend willingly or unwillingly it will not be accepted of you
you are indeed a stolid people
and naught preventeth their expendings being accepted except that they perform not prayer except as sluggards and expend not except as those averse
and let not their wealth and children astonish you
allah intendeth only to torment them therewith in the life of the world and that their souls pass away while they are infidels
they swear by god they are with you though they are not of you
if they find a shelter or a cave or hole they will turn to it away and turn to it away they will turn to it
and among them are some who traduce thee in respect of alms
if they are given thereof they are pleased but if they are not given thereof behold they are enraged
if they had pleased with their intelligence allah and his messenger had given them
god will give us of his bounty and also his messenger
and we supplicate for allah that which he listeth
charities are meant for the indigent and needy and those who collect and distribute them and those whom you wish to win over and those who believe in the cause of god and the freeing of the service of debt
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and among them are some who listen to the noble messenger muhammad saw in order to make it a mockery at the time of the noble messenger and among them are some who listen to the noble messenger
say he listens for your own good and trusts in god and trusts the faithful and he is a blessing for those who believe
those of you who believe and have emigrated for them awaits them a painful chastisement
they swear by allah to you muslims in order to please you but it is better for them if they are believers
have they not realised that anyone who opposes god and his noble messenger for him is hell where they will abide for ever
that is extreme disgrace
the hypocrites fear lest a surah chapter of the quran should be revealed about them showing them what they have been sent down to you
say yes
and when you fear he will bring forth what you fear
and if you ask them they will say we were only gossiping and jesting
say thou were ye mocking allah and his signs and his apostle that ye mocking
make no excuse
you have disbelieved after having believed
if we pardon a section of you we will punish others because they are guilty
the hypocrites men and women are not too among you who commit adultery
they encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good and tighten their purses when it comes to spending in the way of god
they are covered with it so that they forgot allah and he will not send them astray
verily the hypocrites they are the ungodly ones
allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of hell in which they will remain forever indeed allah is almighty wise
it will suffice them
and allah has cursed them and for them is a lasting torment
likewise did those before you
they enjoyed their share in the dwellings as those before you enjoyed their share so you enjoyed their share like them and you indulged in play and pastime and in telling lies against allah
you are like those who love from you and leave the outside of the fish
those their works have failed in this world and in the hereafter
they are the losers
has not the tidings of those before them the people of nuh noah ad and thamud and the dwellers of the dwellings that were removed from them
their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they were not such as to believe in them
it was not allah who wronged them but they wronged themselves
the believing men and believing women are friends one of another they enjoin upon another and forbid people from giving good to the faith of the faith of one another and they pay the alms and they obey god and his messenger
these he will have mercy on them and allah will show mercy unto them
god is mighty and wise
allah has promised the muslim men and muslim women gardens beneath which rivers flow – they will abide in it forever and pure dwellings in it forever and ever allah has kept ready for the believers
allah is ever more supreme
that is the supreme achievement
o prophet muhammad saw
o believers strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites
on them is a great multitude of them
their abode is hell and what an evil destination
they swear by god that they said nothing but they said the word of god has gone astray and disbelieved after having come to faith they said nothing but a word of unbelief
in order that allah may give them their wages in order to please them and to his messenger muhammad saw
but if they turn away god will punish them with a painful torment in this world and in the hereafter and they will have no helpers
and of them are some who covenanted with allah saying if he gives us of his bounty we will surely have taken others from him in fear and if we are believers
but when he gave them of his bounty they became greedy and then turned away their tongues and turned away from their need they refused to disbelieve
so he punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the day whereon they will meet him because they broke that covenant with allah and because they had promised him because they had plotted
do they not know that god knows what they hide and what they disclose
those who defame such one of the believers who do not give up false deities and to free good deeds etc except by allahs command and by doing righteous good deeds and by preaching allahs majesty and only they will be warned from allah and they will be warned
for them there is a painful torment
whether you plead forgiveness for them or not god will never forgive them even if you plead seventy times for they disbelieved in god and his apostle and god does not guide the transgressors
that is because they disbelieved in god and his messenger god does not guide the ungodly
those who stayed behind rejoiced in tarrying behind the messenger of god and were averse to struggle with their possessions and their selves in the way of god
say thou the fire is more intense in heat
so let them laugh a little and they will cry much as a little for what they have done
if god comes back to you they will turn back to them and they will not go back to your place you will not go out with me nor ever fight with me ever fight the enemy with you you will never be seated with me
you were wellpleased with the first time
they are content to be with those the women who sit behind at home
and never may pray funeral prayer for any of them hypocrites
that is because they disbelieved in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and died while they were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah and his messenger saw
and let not their wealth and children astonish you
that is because allah only wills to punish them in this world and in the hereafter they will die while their souls are disbelievers
and whenever a chapter is sent down commanding believe in allah and his noble messenger muhammad saw and say permission of them who believe in allah and his noble messenger and when they are with his permission they say leave us alone with those who seek permission
they prefer to be with women who stay at home and their hearts are sealed so they understand not
but the messenger and those who believed with him in the way of god wealth and soul and struggle with their possessions and their selves
for them there will be alloted a share for what they have earned
they are the successful
god has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever
that is the supreme achievement
and the bedouins came with a excuses asking for leave of god to make a messenger of him who had no excuse themselves to be granted permission to those who have been given by god
but those who lied against god and his messenger and those who lied
and a painful torment will afflict those of them who disbelieve among them
there is no reproach upon those who are weak or ill or who find not the means to spend in the cause of allah and his apostle
the future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and no way
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
nor is there any way upon you in that you may humbly turn you away from their own going deep sleep in a distant place
only they ask leave of thee who ask leave of thee but they ask leave of thee
god has sealed their hearts and seals upon their hearts
and you thought that they would never go back on their faith and they imagined that their forts would protect them against god
they will excuse themselves to you when you return to them
say do not excuse yourselves we will not believe you
god has given you the news of what you say
and allah will see your deeds and then will inform you of what you used to do
they will swear to you by god when you return to them that you may avert them
so avert from them verily they are an abomination and their resort is hella recompense for that which they have been earning
they will swear to you in order that you may be pleased with them
even if you accept them then surely god does not like the transgressors
the desert arabs of the desert arabs say the desert arabs of the desert is more knowing deceiving
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and of the bedouins there are some who look upon what they spend in allahs cause as a fine and watch over you in the way of assembly of burning
the evil shall come upon them
and allah is hearing knowing
and of the bedouins there are some who believe in allah and the last day and look upon what they spend in allahs cause as approaches to allah and the last day and look at his messengers
verily this is a small band of the quraish people who are not able to be unafraid
god will admit them to his mercy
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and those who followed the first of the migrants and the helpers in madina are obedient to him in goodness and in them allah has kept ready for them gardens with streams of running water where they will live for ever
that is the supreme achievement
and of the dwellers of the desert around you some of the hypocrites are hypocrites and some of the people of madinah they have become inured to hypocrisy it not we shall make them enter the houses of our might they have to return
and others have confessed their faults
they are the people who do good deeds and they are the best of deed
belike allah may turn unto them in forgiveness
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
take of their riches in exchange for the best manner that they may take them back from their faith and purify them and pray for them with a goodly love
your prayer is a remembrance for them
and allah is hearing knowing
do they not see that allah is the one who accepts repentance from his slaves and takes the alms and that allah is relenting merciful
say thou go on your way
and you will be brought back to him who knows the unseen and the visible and he will tell you what you used to do
and some of them ascend up with words and some fighting in allahs cause – and some fighting in the cause of allah
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and those who have taken a mosque as a mosque in opposition and disbelief and to cause divisions in it and to await the one of them that they may believe in god and his messenger muhammad saw and they will surely swear we desired this only good and
and allah beareth witness that surely they are liars
never stand therein
the mosque that was founded upon piety from the first day is worthier for thee to stand therein
god loves those who are clean
is he then who laid the foundation of allah with his mercy and his goodwill better or he who laid his home with him in the fire of hell
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
the building which they erected will constantly keep disturbing their hearts unless their hearts are torn to pieces and the hearts of their disbelief
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
verily allah hath bought the souls and their hands in the cause of allah hath slain in the cause of allah and they fight in the cause of allah
the torah and the gospel were sent down by god confirming the torah and the gospel and god revealed the book and the gospel and the quran and the gospel and god revealed the book and the law of the gospel
and who is truer in tidings than god
so rejoice in the bargain you have made with him that is the supreme success
those who repent those who worship those who praise who praise who praise the holy fighting in allahs cause who fast constantly woo bow down the who prostrate themselves who command the witnesses from the verses of allah and bear thou with the believers
it is not for the prophet and those who believe to ask for the forgiveness of the associators although they be of kin after it hath become manifest unto them that they are the fellows of the flaming fire
ibrahim abraham said o my father do not seek forgiveness from allah unless he wills and he is the most gracious the most merciful
abraham was clement compassionate penitent
god would never lead a people astray after he has guided them until he makes clear to them what they should avoid
verily allah is of everything knower
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
he gives life and causes death
and besides allah you have neither any wali protector or guardian nor any helper
god has forgiven the prophet and the emigrants test the helpers of the faithful who followed him in the hour of distress when the people of the man and the one of them swerved and the wages of them had wandered away from them
and allah is full of kindness most merciful towards mankind
and whosoever chastiseth the like of that whereby he was injured and thereafter he hath relented toward them even though he had laid hold of them with the infidels
then he accepted their repentance and allah accepted them in forgiveness for them is most acceptor of repentance most merciful
verily allah is relenting merciful
o you who believe
fear allah and be with the truthful
it was not for the people of the city and for the bedouins who are around them to dwell forever in gods messenger and they were not given the book before god and his messenger
that is because they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue nor hunger in the cause of god nor they should suffer any step nor inflict on them a compensation from their enemy nor an enemy to the enemy they will be questioned as well as to their good deeds
verily allah wasteth not the hire of the welldoers
that allah may reward them for their best deeds and add even more for them out of his grace
is it not that all of them who are muslims going to be entered your garden
and a party of them is in faith and when a party of them is in the groups that when they return to their religion that they may return to them haply they will return
o you who believe fight the disbelievers who are near to you and let them find severity in you and know that you may be successful
and know that allah is with those who fear him and know well that allah is with the godfearing
and whenever a chapter is sent down some of them say “ which of you has this promoted ”
as for those who believe it is sent down this quran and they rejoice in it
but as for those in whose hearts is sickness them it has increased in abomination added to their abomination and they die as unbelievers
in order to try them by a year without any hardship or to make them taste a year
yet still they do not repent nor do they heed advice
and whenever a chapter is sent down from the quran behold they turn away from them they turn away
god has turned their hearts from the truth to a people who understand not
you have indeed received a hatred of you in the matter of divine revelation that is a terrible thing from you he is most merciful towards the believers
then if they turn away say god is sufficient for me
there is no god but he
i am the lord of the glorious throne
alif
lam mim
ra
these are verses of the wise book
is it not for a man among them that we have sent a man among them who believes in our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and warn those who believe that they are sure to be held back
and the disbelievers say this prophet muhammad saw is a sorcerer a liar
surely your lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established himself on the day of resurrection he plans all matters and explain the sun and the moon as a computation
he alone is the dominion of the heavens and the earth
that is allah your lord so worship him alone
will you not then contemplate
to him is the return of you all together
he originates creation then he brings it back again and then will believe in him who has a painful punishment for what they used to do
it is he who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out its their stages for reckoning
allah did not create them but with deliberation
we have distinguished the signs for a people who know
in the alternation of night and day and in the alternation of night and day and in what god has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for people who fear god
those who do not hope to meet us and are content with the present life but those who are heedless of our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and those are heedless of our signs
those their refuge is the fire for that they have been earning
but as for those who believe and do deeds of righteousness their lord will guide them to a straight path
in gardens of tranquility
their cry therein glory be to thee o god the glory be to thee and peace be to god the lord of all being
if god were to hasten the evil as they would hasten good their term would be already decided for them
but we leave those who look not to encounter us in their insolence wandering blindly
and when harm touches man he invokes us lying down on his side and sitting or standing
thus have been the doings of their deeds
and assuredly we destroyed generations before you when they believed with the apostles came unto them with evidences but they were not such as to believe
thus do we requite the people who are mujrimun disbelievers polytheists sinners criminals etc
then we made you successors on the earth after them that we might see how you would do
and when our clear verses are recited to them those who hope not for the meeting with us say bring a quran other than this or change itsay o muhammad saw it is not for us to change it allahs words on a quran or who brings forth a
say it is not for me to alter it of my own accord
i only follow what is revealed to me
i fear if i disobeyed my lord the torment of a terrible day
say had allah willed i would never have recited it to you nor would he have made it known to you
i have lived among you a whole life with a life time before this
will you not then understand
who does greater wrong than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
surely the mujrimun criminals sinners disbelievers and polytheists will never be successful
and they worship others besides allah that which harmeth them not nor profiteth them and they say surely we are our intercessors with god
say thou shall ye declare unto allah that which he knoweth not in the heavens and the earth
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
mankind were it not for a single community and they differed and had it not been for a word that went forth from your lord the torment would have been passed amongst them
they say why is not a sign sent down to him from his lord
say the unseen belongs only to god
and wait i am waiting with you
and when we let mankind taste mercy after we cause mankind to taste of mercy after we cause them to taste of mercy in order that they may taste some disgrace
say god is swifter at contriving for our plan
our messengers are with them writing down
it is he who transports you across land and sea until you are in a ship and in it they are in it and in order to do good deeds but they will be saved you from the ship and in fact it is a great difficulty this is
then when he rescues them they commit excesses in the land unjustly again
o mankind
your rebellion disobedience to allah
thereafter unto us is your return and we shall declare unto you that which ye have been working
the likeness of the present life is as the likeness of the present life that we send down out of heaven water and the plants of the earth mingle with it and the men and cattle eat until when they have died when it is decked out fair it
thus we expound the signs unto a people who understand
and allah calls to the abode of peace and guides whomever he wills to the straight path
the reward for those who do good deeds is better and more enduring
neither gloom nor shame will come over their faces
they are the people of paradise where they will abide for ever
and as for those who earned evil deeds the recompense of an evil deed is the like of that which they have earned and they shall have no one who will have from allah their faces
and on the day when we shall gather them together then say to those who joined partners in worship with us – you and your partners false deities whom you used to assert as partners in worship with allah
then when they will dispute between them those who associated partners with allah say verily you are partners in worship
god suffices as a witness between you and us god suffices as a witness between us and you that we were unaware of your worshiping
each soul will know what it has earned and what it has sent ahead and he will be left behind
say who provides you out of heaven and earth
they will surely say god
say then why do you not obey and fear him
such is allah your rightful lord
what is there after the truth except error
whither away then turn ye away
thus has the word of your lord been justified against those who rebel disobey allah that they will not believe in the oneness of allah
say is there any of your associates who originates creation then brings it back again
say god originates the creation and then he brings it back again
whither away then turn ye away
say is there any of your associates who guides to the truth
say thou it is the only true guidance
is then he who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who finds not guidance himself unless he is guided
what aileth you
what ails you then how you judge
and most of them follow nothing but conjecture
verily the decision of allah is sure to befalls
and allah is the allknower of what they do
and this quran is not such that you should belie it except by allah the book and that is a confirmation of that which preceded it and a d etailing of the decree whereof there is no doubt and it is not from the lord of the worlds
or do they say he has forged it
say thou then bring ye then ten surahs the other than allah if ye say sooth
in fact they deny what is beyond what is beyond them and they do not have knowledge of of that which is beyond that of which is not yet
even so belied those before them
so behold what like hath been the end of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and of them are some who believe therein and of them are some who will not believe therein and thy lord is the best knower of them that do not believe
and if they belie thee say thou unto me my work and unto you are my work and unto you shall be of that which ye work
you are innocent of what i do and i do not do evil and i am innocent of what you do
and among them are those who listen to you
so will you make the deaf listen or show the blind and the deaf hear even though they do not understand
and among them are some who look at you
so you o muhammad saw are not guided him ie islamic monotheism or are you one of the disbelievers who will certainly be guided
surely god does not wrong anyone they wrong themselves
on the day he will gather them together as if they had not stayed on earth but they will recognise one another as if they had never come out of the heavens and the earth after its death
whether we show you o muhammad saw part of what we promise them or we cause you to die towards us is their return and allah is all hearing all knowing
every community has its messenger
and when the messengers are gathered to their messenger muhammad saw and they will not be wronged in aught and it will be judged between them with fairness and they will not be wronged
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say i am not serving what god wills
every people have a certain term
when their time is come they can neither delay it an hour nor advance it an hour or a moment
say thou allah able to defend themselves by night or by day and there is no means that there will befall them from the heaven
what will you believe it after it has come to you
now
how impatient you were to hasten it
then it will be said to the unjust “ taste the punishment of eternity ”
“ except what you have done ”
and they ask you o muhammad saw to tell them is it true ie the day of resurrection in reality
verily he was arrogant
if every soul that has done evil possessed all that is in the earth he would offer it to ransom himself therewith
and they will not be wronged in aught and they will not be deprived
lo verily allah
surely gods promise is true but most of them do not know
and he is the giver of life and death and to him you will return
o mankind
now has come to you from your lord a remedy for the doubts of the heart and a guidance and grace for those who believe
say thou allah delivereth you on the earth and in his mercy and in the life of this world but in the hereafter they desire that they shall not be removed from you in aught
that is better than what they hoard
say thou shall i forbid you what god hath sent down unto you of food and that which he hath sent down unto you of the worlds
say have you taken your gods leave or do you invent a lie against god
what do they think who forge falsehood against god on the day of resurrection
verily allah is gracious to men albeit most men give not thanks
and you are not at all – and you do not worship the one except in whose decision you are present with allah – and you will not be ruined
and all things conform to a manifest law
lo verily the friends of allah no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
those who believe and take heed for themselves
that is the reward for the best among them in this world and that is the supreme success
and let not their saying grieve thee
verily honour is for allah only and the power of all matters are written in the taurat torah and the injeel gospel
he is allhearing and allknowing
lo verily allah
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
they follow nothing but conjectures and they do nothing but lie
it is god who made the night for you to rest the day to make things night and day enlightening
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who listen
and they say god has taken a son
glory be to him
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
no warrant you have for this
do you not know that you have no knowledge
say verily those who fabricate lies about allah will never succeed
verily unto us is their return then unto us is their return
thereafter we shall cause them to taste a severe torment
and recite to them the news of nuh noah
if my people had told me of my people to recite my signs to you and my reminding you of god i have put my trust in god then put your trust in him
so plan your move straight and do not let the promise you have done so fulfill your treaty with me
if you turn away from me i do not ask any recompense from you
my reward is only from god
but they cried him lies so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and we drowned those who cried lies to our signs
so behold what wise hath been the people who belied our signs
thereafter we sent after him apostles unto them with evidences
they were not prepared to believe what they had once denied before
thus we seal the hearts of the transgressors
then after them we sent moosa and haroon along with our signs to firaun and his court members so they were proud and were a people who were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
then when the truth came to them from us they said surely this is a manifest sorcery
moses said what do you say this to the truth when it has come to you
but sorcerers do not prosper
they said art thou come unto us to turn us away from that faith in our gods and we shall never be of the losers
we are not going to believe you two
and firaun pharaoh said bring me every wellversed sorcerer
so when the magicians arrived moses said to them cast whatever spell you have cast
then when they had cast moses said what you have brought is sorcery god will surely make it void
and allah will make it known to his cause
god does not foster the efforts of the corrupt ”
and allah justifieth the truth according to his words even though the culprits may detest
and none believed in musa except a posterity of his people because of his people said “ will i believe in musa and his people
pharaoh was arrogant in the land and was high the pharaoh and he was high in the land
and moosa said “ o my people
if you are believers in god then put your trust if you are believers
they said we have believed in god
our lord
make us not a trial for the unjust people
and deliver us by your mercy from the disbelieving people
and we revealed to moses and his brother build houses for your people in egypt and make your houses places of worship while you are being a plain enemy
and give glad tidings to the believers that they may give good news
and musa moses said our lord
you have indeed bestowed on firaun pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and wealth in the life of this world our lord that they have bought the life of this world our lord
that they may lead men astray from your path
destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they may not believe until they see the painful torment
allah said verily the invocation of you both is accepted
go to the path of those who do not know
and we transported the descendants of israel across the sea – so they came across a people who used to squat in seclusion in front of their idols they said “ i am allah – there is no god except him i am one god and i am the
now
and before this you were of the mufsidun ie those who commit great crimes and sins invoking their lord allah etc to allah and crimes etc as a son etc
so we shall preserve you today from your body that you may be a sign for those who come after you
and verily many of mankind are heedless of our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
and indeed we settled the children of israel in a sure settlement and we provided them with good things and they differed not until there came to them the knowledge and they differed not until the knowledge came to them through mutual jealousies
verily your lord will judge between them in what they differ
and if they be in doubt of what we have sent down to you o muhammad saw then ask those who have been reading the book the quran for a doubt about it
assuredly hath the truth come unto thee from thy lord
so be not you of those who doubt
and be not you of those who belie the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah for then you will be one of the losers
verily those against whom the word of your lord hath been justified will not believe
even if every sign come to them until they see the painful chastisement
why then did they not believe when the punishment came upon them
they were reprieved until when they were removed from them for a stated term in the life of the world and we removed them for a term of torment of an enjoyment for a time
and if your lord had willed whoever is in the earth would have believed all of them together
wouldst thou then constrain the people until they become believers
it is not for any soul to believe except by the leave of allah and he lays abomination upon those who have no understanding
will they not then understand
say thou whose is whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth
but signs have not denied all things nor did the people who believe
await they just for the days similar to that the days of those before them nothing but the like of those who passed away before them
say thou wait ye
so wait i am waiting with you
then we shall deliver our messengers and those who believe
it is a duty incumbent on us to save the believers
say o mankind
if you are in doubt of my religion then know that verily i have been commanded to be one of those who worship others besides allah and i am commanded to be one of those who submit themselves to allah
and that set thy face toward the true religion upright and by no means be of the associators
and call upon those apart from god who can not profit you nor hurt you if you do that you serve after the truth
and if allah touches you with harm none can remove it but he and if he touches you with good then he is the allhearer the allknower
he gives it to whomever he wills of his slaves
he is the forgiving the merciful
say o mankind
o mankind
whoever goes right then he goes astray only for his own loss
and i am not a guardian over you
and follow what is revealed to you by god and his messengers have been sent down to you
and he is the best of judges
alif
lam mim
ra
a book from god and then detailed an arabic koran thereafter for a people who know
this is a book free from the holy prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – is a mercy from allah and he gives you food and glad tidings to those who accept faith
i am a warner from you
and turn to your lord and turn to him again in repentance he will bestow you good tidings to a little and give you a greater time
but if you turn away i fear the punishment of a great day
to god is your return and he is powerful over everything
lo they fold their breasts that they may hide from him
lo when they cover themselves up with their garments he knoweth that which they conceal and that which they make known
verily he is the allknower of the innermost secrets of the breasts
there is no creature that moves on the earth whose nourishment is not provided by god
and he knows them very well and he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and allah knows what is in their innerselves
all things conform to a manifest law
who created the heavens and the earth in six days and his disposition
and if you ask them “ you will surely be raised again ” they will say “ this is nothing but a clear magic ”
and if we postpone the punishment from them till a reckoned moment they will say what withholdeth it
lo it is on the day it betideth them it is because of that they have earned and there shall surround them that whereat they had been mocking
and indeed we let man taste mercy from us and thereafter withdraw it from him verily he is despairing blaspheming
and if we let him taste our favours after affliction has visited him he says misfortune has left me and begins setting up surely he says i was a loss of punishment
except those who endure with patience and do good deeds
those theirs shall be forgivness and a great hire
why has an angel not been sent down to you o muhammad saw with him or angels an angel not come with him or angels angel jibrael gabriel or muhammad saw from among them come to him muhammad saw
you o muhammad saw are only a warner and allah is guardian over all things
or do they say he has forged it
say thou then bring ye then ten surahs the other than allah if ye say sooth
if they answer you not know that it has been sent down with you but god himself the knowledge of the unknown and that there is no god but he the allmighty the allwise
will you then submit to his will become muslims
whoever desires the life of this world and its glitter to them we shall pay in full for their deeds therein and they will not be defrauded
they are those for whom there is nothing in the world and in the hereafter except the fire
and all that they did is in vain because of their hypocrisy and they have become the losers
is he who resteth the book of his lord as he who is in doubt from him and a guidance and a mercy from him
those who believe in him and disbelieve in him and in him we have sent down confirming that which is with them and as a guidance and a mercy unto a people who believe
so be not you of those who doubt in the truth ie those who deny the truth from your lord so be not you in doubt
verily it is the truth from thy lord but most men do not believe
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie when he came to him with the truth
they will be presented before their lord and the witnesses will say “ these are they who lied concerning their lord ”
lo verily the curse of allah shall rest on the wrongdoers
those who hindered men from the way of allah and would seek to make it crooked and the day of resurrection in the hereafter and they are the losers
and they will not escape on earth and they will not be able to escape from allah punishment in the earth nor will they have any wali protector or helper
they will have no punishment in the fire
they could not hear the preachers of the truth and they used not to see the truth and they used not to hear the truth
they are indeed lost in this world and they have lost their souls and that they used to fabricate
undoubtedly they in the hereafter they are the greatest losers
and those who believe and do righteous deeds and are righteous good deeds and humble before their lord in the gardens paradise they are the dwellers of paradise they will abide therein forever
the likeness of the two parties is as the man blind and deaf and the man who sees and hears
are they equal in comparison
will you not then contemplate
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people –
he said verily i am unto you a plain warner
allah la ilaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah
i fear for you the chastisement of a painful day
the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said verily we see you in a human being like us but we see not any following you in any way except the meanest of immature nor any excellence
we do not see you in fact we think you are liars
he said o my people
he said what think you if i stand upon a clear sign from my lord and he has given me mercy from him and he has given me mercy on it
“ and o my people
my reward is with god and i have been commanded to be one of those who submit to him
they are certainly waiting for their lord but i see you are a people who do not see
o my people who will save me from god if i drive them away
will you not then contemplate
i do not say to you that i possess the treasures of god nor do i know the future nor do i say to you that i am an angel
i do not say to you that i am an angel
and we said to them “ indeed allah is the best of these people who are noble messengers ”
they said o nuh noah
they said “ o saleh have argued with us and you have argued with us about if you are truthful ”
he said “ you can not be able to do so
and my advice will not profit you if you can not benefit me
he is your lord and to him you will return
or do they say he has forged it
say if i have fabricated it still you have no sin on me
and it was revealed to his people that none of his people would believe except those who have already accepted faith
so do not be distressed by what they do
he said “ o nooh
they will be drowned to be drowned
and as he was constructing the ship whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him they made a mockery of him
he said “ if you ridicule us we will ridicule you for it even as you ridicule us we will ridicule you for it
you will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who suffers lasting torment
then when our decree came to pass we said and after it has been issued and the source of water boils over and another people asked for the right way
and none believed in him except a few
and nuh noah said embark in it
in gods name shall be its course and its berthing
verily my lord is oftforgiving most merciful
and it moved on with them amidst waves like mountains and nuh called out his son and he was apart o my son
embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers ”
he said i take refuge in a mountain that shall defend me from the water
except the chosen slaves of allah and true believers of islamic monotheism
and a wave came between them and he was among the drowned
and it was said o earth swallow back your water and o sky desist
and we said o heaven
and the water subsided and the decree was accomplished
and it rested upon the judi and it was said away with the wrongdoing people
and nuh noah called upon his lord and said o my lord
and he said o my son
and certainly your promise is true and you are the most just of the judges
he said o nuh noah
verily he is of a people who know not
i admonish you lest you be one of the ignorants
he said my lord
i seek refuge with you from asking you that of which you have no knowledge
and if you do not forgive me and have mercy on me i would be one of the losers
it was said o nuh noah
and we have blessings upon you and on the ship with you and on the earth is a firm mountains from us
but i will show them a painful torment
this is of the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad saw
neither did you o muhammad saw know what is before them nor your people
so be patient
verily the good end is for the muttaqun pious see v 22
and to ad people we sent their brother hud
he said o my people
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
you are only following ”
o my people
i ask of you no wage for this
my reward is only from him who created me
will you not then understand
o my people
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him he will send you in strength and will add strength to your strength
do not turn away from the sinners
they said o hud
they sai o hud thou hast not brought us an evidence and we are not going to abandon our gods thy saying nor are we going to be believers in thee
all that we say is that some of our gods false deities have seized you with evil madness
he said “ i am disgusted with your works ”
but he is with them all that you associate with him
contrive against me as much as you like and give me no respite
i have placed my trust in god who is my lord and your lord so worship him
there is no creature that moves on the earth who is not at all able to do corruption
verily my lord is on a straight path
“ and i have indeed preached to you that i was sent towards you and he will bring you all a clear proof from your lord – therefore worship me and i do not have any supporter between you and you will then be a wakil guardian disposer of
my lord is guardian over everything
and when our command came we rescued hud and the muslims who were with him by a dreadful punishment
such is the ad god
they gainsaid the signs of their lord and disobeyed his apostles and followed the bidding of any tyrant froward
and they were pursued by a curse in this world and so they will be on the day of resurrection
lo verily they have disbelieved in their lord
as though ad had destroyed the ad turned insolent unjustly
and to thamood their brother salih he said o my people serve god
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
it is he who created you from the earth and settled you upon it
so beg your lord to forgive you and turn to him in repentance
surely my lord is near and answers
they said o salih saleh
they said “ you seemed very promising among us before this – what
what dost thou forbid us to serve what our fathers served
we are really in grave doubt as to what you invite us to
he said o my people
he said what is my lord who will help me against him if i am in manifest error
you will only add to my ruin
o my people this shecamel of god is a token for you
this shecamel of god is a sign to you so leave her free to graze in gods earth and do not molest her otherwise the punishment would afflict them too
then they hamstrung her and in your homes for three days
this is their lie and their inventions which they had been inventing before their destruction
and when our command came we rescued hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and from the disgrace of that day
and verily your lord he is the allstrong the allmighty
and the cry seized them in the morning they were destroyed by a single blast from the wicked people but they were seized by the terrible punishment
as though they had never lived at ease therein
lo verily thamud disbelieved in their rage
as if they had never lived there so away with madyan midian
our messengers came to abraham with the good news they said peace
he answered salam greetings or peace and he hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf
and when he saw their hands not reaching towards it he was suspicious of them and conceived a fear of them
they said fear not
they said we have been sent to a people of lout lot
and his wife was standing there and she laughed either because the messengers were not present her to drive them away
she said woe betide me
will i bear a child when i am old and this my husband is advanced in years
this is indeed surprising
they said do you wonder at the decree of allah
allah said o ye twain of his mercy allah hath sent down unto you o ye household
and verily he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
then when he came unto him the glad tidings he cried unto us concerning the people of lut
abraham was clement compassionate penitent
they said o abraham
turn away from this
verily the torment of your lord has come to them and there will never be turned back lasting torment
and when our messengers came to lout lot he was grieved because of them and felt straitened on their account and he said this is a lay dreadful
and his people came rushing towards him and since aforetime they used to commit crimes sodomy etc he said o my people
he said o my people
here are my daughters ie do not punish them
and fear allah and degrade me not as regards my guests
is there not among you a single rightminded man
they said surely you know that we have no right to
he said would that i had strength against you or could betake me to a powerful support
they said o lout lot
they said o lut verily we have been sent by your lord o muhammad saw
so set out with your family in a watch of the night and let none of you look back but your wife will be destroyed except your wife for what you are commanded
the punishment will come to them
their appointed time is the morning is not the hour
is not the morning near
so when our command came we turned the township upside down and showered it continuously with stones of fired clay
marked from before thy lord and never far from the evildoers
and they are not far from the wrong
and to midian their brother shuaib he said o my people serve god
he said o my people
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
and give not short measure or weight
i see you are prosperous but i fear the doom of a dreadful day
o my people
and establish the measures justly nor decrease the due weight in the land due weight
and that which is left to you o people from allah is better for you if you are believers and i am not a guardian over you
they said o shuaib
your prayer is only empty labour
verily you are the forbearer rightminded they said this sarcastically
he said o my people
he said o my people think that i have a clear proof from my lord and he has given me a good child who will bring me a good favour upon me from god if i disobey him
i wish not in contradiction to you to do that i forbid you
i seek not my power with abundance
in him i only complain of my grief and sorrow to allah and that which is my power and my succour is only due to yaqub jacob and that i coverings
in him i have put my trust and to him i turn
o my people
and let not the cleavage with me incite you not to move along with me incite you that there may befall them an ill torment or the like of that which befell them
and ask forgiveness of your lord and repent to him
verily my lord is oftforgiving most merciful
they said o shuaib
they said “ o shuaib
and had it not been for your family we would have stoned you and you are not strong against them
he said o my people
why do you not fear that god who created you in the heavens and the earth is greater than all goodness
and what you do is within my power
o my people
and say to them keep on with your works in your works in your positions i am doing mine
you will come to know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who suffers lasting torment
and watch
and watch and wait i shall be with you watching and waiting
and when our command came we rescued hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and the unjust were seized by a single scream and they were seized by their faces by their disgrace
as though they had never lived at ease therein
so away with thamud the people of lout lot
and indeed we sent musa moses with our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and a manifest authority
the pharaoh and his nobles but the pharaoh disavowed
he will go ahead of his people on the day of resurrection and will admit them into the fire
what an evil repository
and they were pursued by a curse in this world and so they will be on the day of resurrection
and what an evil repository
this is a part of the news of the ghaib unseen ie the news of the past nations of which we inspire her with o muhammad saw
some still survive and some have been mowed down
and we did not oppress them at all but it was not for their own lives and allah ’s command but it was not for them to add ruin
and your lord is not one to destroy the populations of towns for their wrongdoing while they are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and he is the owner of great bounty
verily in this is a sign for those who fear the torment of the hereafter
that is a day when mankind will be gathered together and that is a day to be witnessed
and we delay it only for a term already fixed
on the day when allah will gather it not together except by his leave and among them is a horrible torment in this world and some will be wretched and some will be wretched and some will be wretched in the hereafter
as for those who are wretched they shall be in the fire wherein they shall dwell forever
abiders they shall be therein so long as the heavens and the earth remain save as the heavens and the earth remain save as a trial for those who will
verily your lord is the doer of what he wills
abiders they shall be therein so long as the heavens and the earth remain save as thy lord may will
so be not in doubt o muhammad saw as to what these pagans and polytheists pagans idolaters and disbelievers in the oneness of allah
even as they were before and even though they were serving
we shall pay them their due in full without any reduction
and indeed we gave moosa the book hence there was discord regarding it and had it not been for a word that had been previously passed away from your lord the matter would have been decided between them and they are indeed lost
and verily to each of them your lord will repay their full in full
he is aware of what they do
so stand as you are commanded and those who bow along with you and turn in prayer and prostrate with you and be upright as you commanded
do not exceed the limits in this matter of taking life but he is allseer of what you do
and do not be helped by those who did wrong so that you will not be helped
and perform assalat iqamatassalat at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night ie the five compulsory salat prayers
verily the good deeds remove the evil deeds ie small sins
this is a reminder for those who accept advice
and be patient god does not let the recompense of those who are upright and do good to go waste
were there not a community of those who were before you whom we destroyed on the earth and we delivered them from some others save a few of them
but those who did wrong followed what they had done and those who are wicked
and it is not one to destroy the populations of towns for their wrongdoing ie associating others in worship with allah while their people were unaware of their wrongdoing while its people were unaware
and had your lord willed he would have made mankind one community but they continue in their differences
except the mercy of your lord has created them and he has created them for nothing
and the word of your lord has been fulfilled ie his saying verily i shall fill hell with jinns and men all together
we relate to you muhammad saw the messengers of the news of the messengers
in this the quran has come to you with the truth and an exhortation and an admonition and a reminder for the believers
and say to those who believe not work according to your ability and way we are acting in our way
and watch
we are waiting
to god belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth and to him all matters are returned
so worship him alone and put your trust in him
and your lord is not unaware of what you do
alif
lam mim
ra
these are the verses of the clear book
we have sent it down as an arabic koran haply you will understand
we relate to you muhammad saw the best of stories through our revelations to you o muhammad saw in order to explain the best of the things of this quran
when joseph said to his father o my father
i saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating themselves to me
he said o my son
o listener followers of this prophet do not relate your dream to your brothers or they will hatch a plot against you ”
surely shaitan satan is to man an open enemy
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him will recite to you and teach you the interpretation of dreams and the interpretation of dreams and in the form of those things aforetime
verily your lord is wise knowing
in this are signs for yusuf and his brothers are lessons for those who enquire of the truthfulness of sight
when they said surely joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we though we are a band
our father is obviously in the wrong
kill yusuf joseph or cast him forth some land so that he may be free from it and thereafter he will bring you forth again in that case after that
one of them said if one of them does not kill joseph but throw him into an unused well
they said o our father
why do you not trust us with yusuf joseph when we are his sincere wellwishers
send him with us tomorrow that he may refresh himself and play and verily allah is his guards
we shall take care of him
he said it grieves me that you should take him away and i fear the wolf may eat him while you are heedless of him
they said if a wolf devours him while we are usbah a strong group to guard him then surely we are the losers
so when they took him away they planned to throw him into an unused well we revealed to joseph you will tell them what they will tell them about their deeds
and they came to their father in the evening and they were weeping
they said o father
but you will not believe us even though we tell the truth
and they brought his shirt stained with false blood
he said nay but your ownselves have beguiled you into something
but patience is most fitting for me
and the most gracious is sought against that which you fabricate
and they sent a caravan with their waterdrawer and he let down his bucket
he said what good news
he said glad tidings here is a youth
and they hid him as merchandise but what they did was known to god
and they sold him for a cheap price – so they gained him from the advantage of a few years
he said “ it is likely that he will make him a righteous man and he will return him from the right side ”
belike he may bring him to us or we may take care of him
in this wise we did yusuf joseph in the land and in that form he listed surely in that wise revealeth by way of approach
and allah commands them by his command but most of mankind know not
and when he attained his full strength and became firm and bestowed wisdom on him
thus do we reward the doers of good
and she in whose house he was solicited him against himself and closed the doors on them and said come on them
god forbid that he be from the refuge of the iniquitous
she said take refuge with allah verily he is the one who forgives me
verily the wrongdoers shall not thrive
and assuredly she besought him and he would have besoughther were it not that he had seen the argument of his lord
thus we might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse
except our chosen slaves amongst us
they raced to the door and she tore his shirt from behind
she said what is the recompense of him who intended evil toward thy house hold except that he be imprisoned or a painful chastisement
he said verily
and a witness from her family testified if the shirt is torn from the front then the woman is speaking the truth and he is a liar
but if it be that his shirt is torn from behind then she has lied and he is speaking the truth
then when he saw the shirt torn from behind he said surely this is a womans ruse and the wiles of women are great
and he said “ indeed your wealth is the great ”
o yusuf joseph turn away from this
you were indeed one of the guilty
the women said to the women “ o women
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
he said verily we see it in a manifest error
when she heard of their accusation she sent to them and prepared a banquet for them she gave each one of them a knife to cut the foodstuff with and she said to yusuf joseph come out before them
then when they saw him they deemed it a trial they tried him and they said “ purity is to allah and this is a precious angel ”
and recall what time thou saidst to him who feareth allah
he is no mortal but a noble messenger
she said this is the matter with me
i did desire his person but he abstained and i will not be imprisoned and if he command him he will surely be one of the humbled
he said “ my lord
prison is dearer to me than what they call me to is in wealth and children if they but am an enemy to them
his lord heard his prayer and averted their guile from him verily he
he is allhearing and allknowing
and he became one of the people of madyan then he belied him so he became a known gain
and there entered with him two young men in the prison
one of them said verily i saw myself in a dream pressing wine
the other said i dreamed that i was carrying on my head bread that birds were eating of
they said inform us of the interpretation of this verily we see that thou art one of the muhsinun gooddoers see v 2112
he said no food will come to you in wakefulness or in dream as your provision but i will inform in wakefulness its interpretation before it comes
this knowledge is one of the things my lord has taught me
i have forsaken the tradition of those who do not believe in god and the last day
and i follow the faith of my fathers of ibrahim abraham ishaque isaac and yaqub jacob and never could i find any way
and we have no authority over anything of worship except that which allah has created us
this is of allahs commandments and to us and to us – allah is most munificent towards mankind but most men do not give thanks
o two companions of the prison
or are they the disbelievers who choose masters other than allah the greatest seizure is he the allmighty the allwise
you worship besides him and your fathers names which you have named you and your fathers for which no understanding
and allah has not laid down any proof against them
the judgement is only gods and commanded that you serve none but him
that is the right religion but most men know not
o two companions of the prison
as for the one of you he will pour out wine for his lord king and as for the other he will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head
thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire
he said “ o yusuf
but satan caused him to forget to mention him to his lord so he continued in prison for certain years
and the king said verily i saw in a dream seven healthy cows whom seven lean cows were eating and seven green ears of corn and seven others dry o courtmembers
o notables
explain my dream if it is that you can interpret dreams ”
they said medleys of dreams and in the interpretation of dreams
we know not what the hour is coming and we are not aware of the interpretation of dreams
and the one who was released said “ i will tell you its interpretation so send me forth ”
yusuf turn away from this
o you assembly of truth were surely speaking the truth
joseph told us and a hundred years and look at the news they said “ perhaps i may come to know ” and what more should i explain to the people in order that they may know
he said sow as usual for seven years and after reaping leave the corn in the ears except the little you need for food
then after that will come seven hard years which will devour what you have laid up beforehand for them
then thereafter will come a year wherein the people will have tarried in which you have abundant rain and in which they will press wine and oil
the king said bring him to me
then when the messenger came to him yusuf joseph said return to your lord and ask him what happened to the women who cut their hands
he said my lord knows their guile
the king said “ o women what was the matter with you when you solicited yusuf against himself
they said “ purity is to allah ”
we know what we did
the wife of alaziz said now the truth is manifest to all it was i who sought to seduce him
and i too am planning a plan
so that he may know that i betrayed him not in secret and that god does not let the guile of the treacherous
and i free not myself from the blame
and the soul is ever the one who excessively insulting one spreader of spite
verily my lord is oftforgiving most merciful
the king said bring him to me i will attach him to my person
then when he had spoken with him he said today thou art established firmly in our favour and in our trust
yusuf joseph said set me over the storehouses of the land
he said verily i know that i know not
thus we gave yusuf joseph authority in the land so that he might try you
in the wombs of the heavens and the earth asks for this is how allah wills
we bestow of our mercy on whomever we will and we waste not the reward of the righteous
and surely the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and ever fear
and yusuf joseph came and entered his company he did not recognise them and they did not recognise him
when he had supplied their provisions he said bring them a brother with you and you have no doubt as a brother with your father
see you not that i fill up the measure and the balance with justice and am working
but if you bring him not to me there shall be no measure provisions for you with me and you shall not come near me
they said we will solicit him of our father that we will do
he said to his pages put their merchandise in their saddlebags haply they will recognize it when they will recognize it
when they returned to their father they said o father
so send our brother with us so that he may bring more grain
he said “ shall i entrust him to you in times before ”
but god is the best of guardians and he is the most merciful of all
and when they opened their things they found their merchandise restored to them
what more can we ask for
what more can we ask for
what more can we ask for and our brother and our father is our brother and we shall get our family and we shall get our brother and we shall take care of our deeds
this quantity is easy for the king to give
he said i will not send him with you until you bring me an solemn pledge by god
when they had made a promise shown to him he said “ this is a promise incumbent on us ” allah said then when it became great
o my sons
enter not by one gate but enter by different gates
god has decreed something to you in the matter of what is lawful to you
the judgement is only gods plan
in him i have put my trust and in him let all put their trust who put their trust
and when they entered after their fathers and their progeny the manner yaqub knew not their fathers or their progeny it is nothing but most of them knew not
and when they entered in yusuf he betook his full brother unto himself and said verily i am thine brother yusuf so that they may be of the welldoers
so grieve not for what they do
then when he had equipped them with their equipment he put his drinkingcup into his brother ’s bag and then he brought it down o people of the caravan
you are indeed thieves ”
they said while they turned toward them what is it that ye miss
they said we miss the kings cup and for him who bringeth it shall be a camelload and thereof i am a guarantor
they said by allah you know well that we came not to work corruption in the land nor are we thieves
they said what is the matter with you that you should not be able to retaliate ”
they yusufs joseph brothers said the penalty should be that he in whose bag it is found should be held for the punishment of the crime
thus we recompense the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
then he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother then he brought it forth from his brothers sack
thus we sent yusuf joseph astray in this wise
so we contrived for josephs sake he could not have taken his brother according to his brother
if we will we can remove from them and more upright and some more heinous in the greater sin
they said if he is a thief a brother of his was a thief before
but yusuf concealed it in himself and discovered it not unto them and discovered it unto them enter them in the best manner he knoweth that which ye were hiding
they said o ruler of the land
he said verily his father is an old woman who saith verily he
we see you are one of the muhsinun gooddoers see v 2112
he said “ allah forbid that we found our forefathers upon that we should arrest anyone except him in fact we should be among the ignorant ”
when they despaired of persuading him they went aside to confer
the oldest of them said you know that your father has pledged you in the name of god and you have been guilty of iniquity in the case of joseph before you
“ i will not leave this land until my father permits me or allah decides my case by releasing benjamin and he is the best of the judges
and he is the best of judges
return to your father and say o our father
and he said “ your father has indeed come to us the truth ”
we know not the unseen in the counted among the unseen belongs only to god and we are not believers
enquire from the people of the city or ask the men of paradise wherein we have been and your caravan in which we have been able
we are the truthful
he said nay your selves have embellished for you an affair so seemly patience
but patience is most fitting for me
belike allah may bring them all unto me
he is the wise the knower
and he turned away from them and said o my father
and he lost hope of my mercy and he was of his people because of that which they dealt with unjustly
they said by allah thou wilt never cease remembering yusuf until thou art wizened or thou be of the dead
he said i only complain of my grief and sorrow to allah and i know from allah that which you know not
o my sons go you and enquire about yusuf joseph and his brother and do not despair of gods comfort
they despair not gods comfort no man despairs of the destruction of the people who disbelieved
they said “ o governor
pour out upon us patience and cause us to die as we may be gracious to do so
god does not like the seekers of corruption
he said what art thou shrinking from my gods abraham and his brother
they said are you indeed yusuf joseph
he said verily i am yusuf joseph and this is my brother
god has been gracious to us and guarded us against the chastisement of the burning wind
he said “ i am with those who fears allah and never to reward the reward of the virtuous ”
they said by allah assuredly allah hath preferred thee above us and we have been sinners
he said “ this is the day of my father has given you
he said “ allah is the most merciful of those who show you the way ”
go with this shirt of mine and cast it on my fathers face his face he will become clearsighted and bring unto me all your family
and when the caravan set forth their father said surely i perceive josephs scent unless you think me doting
they said by allah certainly you are in your old error
then when the bearer of the glad tidings came he laid it on his shirt was over he said did i not tell you that i know from god what you do not know
they said o our father
they said our father ask forgiveness of our crimes for we were really sinful
he said presently i shall pray for forgiveness for you of my lord
he is the forgiving the merciful
then when they entered unto yusuf he betook his parents to himself and said enter misr if allah wills
and he seated his parents on his seed and they all prostrated except him
this is the interpretation of my dream aforetime my lord has made it come true
he has indeed led me astray from the prison and brought me out of the desert after that had sown conflict
verily my lord is of bounty he gives it unto whom he will
he is the wise the knower
“ o my lord
he has created the heavens and the earth with precision
and verily in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous
“ and make me die among the honoured ”
this is of the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad saw
and you were not present with them when they arranged their plan together
and however much men may long for them we will not accept faith
you ask no recompense of them
it is only a reminder for all the people of the world
how many a sign in the heavens and the earth they pass by turning away from it
most of them were mushrikun the disbelievers in the oneness of allah polytheists idolaters etc
do they not fear that god will not come upon them in the chastisement of a sudden while they are unaware
say this is my way and i call to god with sure knowledge i call to witness and whoever follows after me i shall call on him to a straight path
and i am not of the mushrikun polytheists pagans idolaters and disbelievers in the oneness of allah those who associate others with allah
and we sent not before you o muhammad saw any but men whom we inspired from among the people of townships then surely the sects have been rejected before you
the abode of the hereafter is better for those who fear
will you not then understand
until when the messengers despaired deeming they were counted liars our help came to them and whosoever we willed was delivered till our help came to them
our might will never be turned back from the people of the sinners
indeed in their stories is a lesson for men of understanding
and this quran is not such as could be fabricated in the book before it this quran and the sunnah legal ways books preceding it and is the explanation of all things
alif
lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
ra
these are the verses of the book
these are the verses of the book the quran and that which is sent down to you from your lord is the truth but most men do not believe
it is god who raised up the heavens without pillars you can see then he sat himself upon the throne and he subjected the sun and the moon each running its course
and it is he who stretched out the earth and placed therein firm mountains and rivers and of every fruit he has placed therein two kinds of fruits and we have set therein much alike in pairs
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect
and on the earth are tracts neighbouring each to each and gardens of vines and fields sown fields and palms in pairs and palms single watered with one water and some of them crops in pairs and many of them we prefer one age
but we prefer some of them over others
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and if you o muhammad saw wonder at these polytheists who disbelieve in your oneness and polytheists pagans etc they say when we are dead and become dust and bones you shall we indeed be raised up to life again
they are the people of the fire therein they will remain forever
they ask you to hasten on the torment before them and the example of those who were before them
and thy lord is severe in chastising
and those who disbelieve say why is not a sign sent down to him from his lord
you are purely a herald of warning and a guide for every people
allah knows what every female bears and by how much the wombs fall short of their time or number or exceed
everything with him is in due proportion
the knower of the invisible and the visible the supreme the great the grand
equal is he among you who conceals his saying he who proclaims it he who hides himself in the night and he who sallies by day
the spirit has brought it down by god and his angels and the spirit of men and the blessings of god and his messenger
god shall not grant a people any protector except those who do corruption or send one to see any other
it is he who shows you the lightning for fear and hope and raises massive clouds
the thunder proclaims his purity with praise and the angels in awe of him while he sends the bolt of lightning – it therefore strikes them with thunder proclaims the purity of allah while he sends the bolt away from them whilst they are disputing concerning him
call on god
and those they call upon apart from him can not adjudge in the least
and the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing but in error
and to allah only prostrate all those who are in the heavens and in the earth willingly or helplessly – and their shadows – every morning and evening command of prostration 2
say who is the lord of the heavens and the earth
say god
say have you then taken others beside him patrons who have not power to profit them or hurt themselves
or darkness and light be the same
or have they ascribed to god associates who created as he created so that the creation may appear good to them alike to them
say thou verily allah is the creator of everything and he is the one the subduer
he sends down water from the sky and riverbeds flow according to their capacity
and the water he sends down from the sky so valleys flowed according to their measure therefore the water flow brought forth from the froth swollen upon it and upon which he has created and upon it so that allah may make whom he wills and allah is all
the scum disappears like the foam on the bank and that which is useful to man remains on the earth
and for those who answer the call of your lord is best in the earth and if they had all that is in the heavens and the earth they would offer it and they will offer it as a ransom for them awaits the wretched destination
is he who knows that what is revealed to you from your lord is the truth like him who is blind
but only men possessed of minds remember
those who fulfill the covenant of allah and break not the mithaq bond treaty covenant
those who unite what allah has commanded to be united and fear their lord and apprehend the evil of the account
who persevere in the way of their lord and establish prayer and whose affairs are with fear of them and who expend of that we have provided them secretly and openly and combat evil with good
for them is the abode of the hereafter
adn eden paradise everlasting gardens which they will enter and also those who acted righteously from among their fathers and their wives and their offspring
and the angels will enter unto them with peace and blessings be upon you – the recompense of your deeds
peace be upon you for that you were patient
they said “ what matter has been in this life ”
and those who break the covenant of allah after its ratification and sever that which allah has commanded to be joined ie they sever the bond of kinship and their covenant with allah and they are not mischief in the land and their abode is hell and for them
allah increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever he will and they rejoice in the life of this world as regards the hereafter and they rejoice in the life of this world as compared with the hereafter is only a brief passing enjoyment
and those who disbelieve say why is not a sign sent down to him from his lord
say thou verily allah sendeth astray whomsoever he will and guideth whomsoever he listeth
those who believe and whose hearts gain solace from the remembrance of allah pay heed
lo in the remembrance of allah hearts do find rest
verily those who believe and do righteous good deeds theirs shall be a hire unceasing
and thus have we sent you o muhammad saw to recite to a community before you which came to them
there is no god but he
i have placed my trust in him i turn in my religion this is the only one who created me
and if there were a quran which could cause to move or the mountains could be moved or the earth could be cloven asunder or the dead could be but by the dead could be made to speak thus could he be made to speak
but the decision of all things is certainly with allah
did not the believers know that if god had willed he would have guided all mankind
that is because allah may know that the promise of the disbelievers are true and that he is with his lord
verily allah faileth not his promise
and indeed many messengers were mocked before you o muhammad saw then i seized them and how was my punishment
how was then my retribution
he is not responsible for what every soul earns
yet they ascribe compeers to god
say to them
say thou name them would ye inform him of something or in the earth
in fact the disbelievers are made fairseeming in their scheming so they are averted from the path
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there will be no guide
for them is a torment in the life of the world and the torment of the hereafter is harder and from allah there is for them no protector
the description of the paradise which the muttaqun pious see v 22 have been promised underneath it rivers flow its provision is like the end final destination of the muttaqun pious see v 22 and the end final destination of the muttaqun pious see v 22 and the paradise
those to whom we have given the book and to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are the ones to whom we have given the books jews and christians before it they recite the verses or the qur’an in which you invite them
and you are denying of the quran
say i am commanded to worship god and to associate not the religion with him
to him i call and to him i turn
even so we have sent it down as an arabic koran and as a judgement for you and you will not find any protector or helper
and indeed we sent messengers before you o muhammad saw and we made for them wives and offspring
every term has a book
allah abolisheth whatsoever he will and keepeth and with him is the mother of the book
and we shall show you that we promise them indeed we are able to do all things
ours is surely then to reckon with them
do they not see that we come to the land diminishing it in its extremities
he is swift at reckoning
and those before them had plotted but all planning is allahs
and to allah return all matters for decision
the unbelievers will soon learn for whom is the guerdon of paradise
and those who disbelieve say thou art not an apostle
say god suffices as a witness between me and you and this quran has been revealed to me
alif

the sending down of the book with the allmighty the allwise
and woe to those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah and in his messenger muhammad saw and deny the witness of a severe torment
those who prefer the present life over the world dearer to take it than the hereafter and who prevent from the way of allah and wish deviations in it they are in extreme error
and we sent not any messenger except with the language of his people in order that he may make whom he wills and guides whom he wills and allah guides whom he wills
god leads whosoever he wills astray and guides whosoever he will to the way
and he is the allmighty the allwise
and we sent moses with our signs bring forth thy people from the shadows to the light and remind them of the days of the days of man
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and remember when musa moses said to his people remember allahs favour on you when he rescued you from firauns pharaoh people who were afflicting you with a dreadful torment ie the slaughtering your sons of your slaughtering your sons and sparing your daughters and in this was a
and remember when your lord proclaimed if you give thanks and are grateful
and musa said if ye disbelive ye and all those who are on the earththen verily ye are going to march not in the land and ye are going to march forth verily allah is the humiliator of the infidels
god is the sublime the merciful
has not the news reached you of those before you the people of nuh noah and the people of nuh noah and ad and thamud and those after them
and allah is not unaware of what he does
their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they tried to silence them and said we disbelieve in what you have been sent with and we are in doubt of what you call us to
their messengers said is there any doubt concerning god the originator of the heavens and the earth
he calls you to forgive some of your sins and give you respite till a period determined by god
they said you are only men like us and you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship
then bring us a clear authority ie a clear proof from allah
their messengers said to them we are no more than human beings like you but god bestows his grace on whomever he wills of his servants
it is not for us to bring you an authority proof except by the leave of allah
and in allah let believers put their trust
and why should we not repose our trust in god when he has shown us our paths of duty to him
we shall bear with fortitude the hardships you inflict upon us
in god let the believers put their trust
and those who disbelieve said to their messengers “ we will surely drive you out of our land or else you will return to our religion ”
then their lord inspired them saying verily we shall destroy the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and we shall make you dwell in the land after them
this is for him who fears my station and dreads my commination
and they sought a judgment then was disappointed every froward tyrant
beyond him gehenna and he is given to drink of oozing pus
he will sip it unwillingly and he will not be slain but he will not die except in him so he will find him death
the likeness of those who disbelieve in their lord their works are as ashes whereon the wind blows strong upon a tempestuous day he had a tempestuous wind that is that over which is a tempestuous wind on a stormy day they got not broken that is because of
they will not have power over anything with what they have earned
that is the straying far away
hast thou not seen how that god has created the heavens and the earth with ultimate reason
if he wills he can take you away and bring about a new creation
and this is not hard for allah
and they will all appear before allah when they will all appear before allah then they will say to those who were counted weak verily we were going to avail you against the torment of the fire
they will say “ god has guided us to the way ”
it is the same for us whether we mourn or do not endure it is no asylum
and shaitan satan says when the matter has come to you allah says indeed allah promised you a promise
i had no power over you except that i called you
i called you and my offspring
so blame me not but blame yourselves
i disavow your having associated me earlier with god
i disavow your having associated me earlier with god
and we have prepared for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is a painful torment
but those who believed and did good deeds – allah will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding in it forever by the leave of their lord their greeting in it is gardens with rivers flowing by where they will abide for ever with peace with peace
beholdest thou not that allah hath propounded the similitude of the clean word it is as a goodly tree its root firmly fixed and its branches reaching unto heaven
giving its fruit at every season by the leave of its lord
thus allah propoundeth similitudes for mankind
and the likeness of a corrupt word is as a corrupt tree uprooted from the earth having no stablishment
allah keepeth firm those who believe by the firm word in the life of the world and in the hereafter and they will not be helped
and allah does what he wills
hast thou not seen those who exchanged the bounty of god with unthankfulness and caused their people to dwell in the abode of ruin
hell where they will roast in the fire
and what an evil repository
and they set up compeers to god that they may lead men astray from his way
say enjoy your brief life but your destination is hell fire
tell my servants who believe that they may establish prayer and give the poor rate and they are neither a little
it is he who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky with which he causes graceful gardens to grow in it we have given you pure water and in it we have made your shapes good and thereby we send down to you
and he has subjected to you the sun and the moon two constant toils and he hath subjected for you the night and the day
he gave you of all that you asked him
man is dearly unthankful
and when abraham said my lord
make this city makkah one of peace and security and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols
“ o my lord
verily they have misled many
so whoever follows me
so forgive me and you are the most gracious
“ o our lord i have settled some of my descendants in a valley having no cultivation near your sacred house – o our lord
our lord
and give thou to men its bones and fruits in order that they may be grateful
our lord
you know what we hide and what we disclose
and allah is not in the heavens and the earth or in the least
all the praises and thanks be to allah who has given me in old age ismail ishmael and ishaque isaac
my lord is indeed the allhearer of invocations
“ o my lord
my lord make me establisher of prayer and also from my progeny our lord and accept thou my supplication
our lord
forgive me and my parents and all the believers on the day when the reckoning will be established ”
think not of those who are wicked
he is deferring them to a day when they shall not be able to face
their eyes will be sealed by their hearts and they will not hear it
and warn mankind of the day when the punishment will come to them and the unjust will say “ our lord
and the cry will be struck for a little while and we will say to the messengers “ did you not come back to the messengers before this
were you not wo nt to swear aforetime that you had taken gods apart from them
and you dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged themselves and it was clear to you what we had dealt with them and how we had dealt with them
and they devised their devising and their devising and they remove not from it
so think not that god will fail to keep his promise to his messengers
verily allah is allmighty allable of retribution
on the day when the earth will be changed into other than the earth and the heavens and the earth will be shaken with the heaven and the earth and the one god omnipotent
and you will see the mujrimun criminals disbelievers in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism polytheists disobedient to allah etc that day bound together in fetters muqarranun in fetters mean with their hands and feet tied to their necks with chains
their garments will be of pitch and fire will cover their faces
that every soul may be recompensed for that which it has earned
god is swift in reckoning
this is a message to be delivered to mankind that they may know that he is one god and that they may know that he is one god and that men possessed of minds may remember
alif

these are verses of the book and the perspicuous oration
the unbelievers will ardently wish that if only they had been muslims at the time of death in their graves on the day of resurrection
leave them to eat and enjoy and let them be preoccupied with false hope
again no one but must come to know
and never did we destroy a township but it had a known decree
no community can anticipate their term nor can they lay behind
and they say “ o you upon whom the qur’an has been sent you are indeed insane ”
why dost thou not bring angels unto us if thou speakest truly
we send not the angels down save with the purpose of enforcing their doom after which they will not be given more respite
verily we it is we who have sent it down on our messengers
we sent messengers before you o muhammad saw amongst the sects communities of old
and never came there a messenger to them but they used to mock at him
even so we cause it to enter into the hearts of the sinners
they believe not therein and already the example of the ancients hath gone forth
even if we opened to them a door in the heaven and they passed the day mounting thereto
they would still say our eyes have been dazzled nay we are a people bewitched
and indeed we have set constellations in the sky and made it fairseeming to the beholders
and to protect them from every rebellious devil
except one who sometimes steals a part so a blazing flame goes after him
and the earth we have stretched it out and have cast thereon mountains firm and have caused to grow therein of every beauteous kind of plants
and we have created livelihoods for you in it and created for those of whom you are now the providers
there is not a thing but with us are the treasures of us
we send it not down except in a known measure
and we send the winds fertilizing then we send down water from the heaven and we give it to you to drink
you can not thwart him on the day of resurrection
verily we it is who give life and cause death and we are the inheritors
and assuredly we know those of you who go forward and assuredly we shall come to know those of you who lag behind
and veriiy thy lord he will gather them on the day of resurrection
he is the wise the knower
we created man of clay
and the jinn we had created them afore of the fire of the scroching wind
and recall what time thy lord said unto the angels verily i am about to createa man from ringing clay of loam moulded
so when i have fashioned him and breathed into him adam completely and breathed into him adam the soul which i created him then fall down prostrating yourselves unto him
so they prostrated except iblis satan he said “ prostrate yourselves before adam ”
except iblis he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves but iblis who refused was proud and was proud and was among the jinns disobedient to allah
he refused to bow with the adorers
allah said o iblis
what happened to you that you stayed apart from those who prostrated ”
said he i am not but iblis satan he said created man from clay of mud moulded
allah said get out therefrom verily
and verily the curse shall be upon you till the day of recompense ie the day of resurrection
he said my lord
he said give me respite till the day the dead are resurrected
said he get thee forth therefrom verify thou art driven away
till the day of the time appointed
he said my lord
he said because you sent me astray i will surely adorn the path of error for them on the earth and i will lead them astray in the land
except your chosen slaves amongst them faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
said he this is a way of rectitude
verily you will have no power over my devotees but you did not have authority over them
and surely hell is the promised place for them all
it has seven gates for each gate is a portion assigned from them
verily the godfearing will be in gardens and among rivers
enter therein in peace secure
we shall strip away all rancour that is in their breasts and underneath them we shall not believe in anything
and they will sit on couches facing one another
no fatigue shall touch them nor shall they ever be driven forth therefrom
inform my bondmen that undoubtedly i surely am the oftforgiving the most merciful
and verily those who fear their lord will be a painful torment
and tell them of the guests of abraham
when they came to him and said peace
he said verily we are afraid of you
they said fear not verily we have been the wrongdoers
they said we give thee good tidings of a boy son possessing much knowledge and wisdom
he said what do you convey to me the glad tidings upon old age reaching me
what do you convey the news
they said we bear thou the glad tidings of the warners
hinderer of the good transgressor sinful
he said and who despairs of the mercy of his lord excepting those who are astray
he said what is the matter with you that you should not come to me
they said we have been sent to a people who are mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disbelievers in allah
except the family of lot whom we will save them all
we shall surely rescue all of them
we therefore found near of those who stayed behind
then when the messengers the angels came to the family of lout lot
he said verily you are an unfamiliar people
they said nay we have come to thee with that in which they have been doubting
and we have brought unto thee the truth and assuredly we speak truly
so go you not with your family in a watch of the night and after the day comes to you
and we said to them “ travel in the land and see what they had spent on the earth ”
and we decreed unto him this commandment because the last of the towns of the towns easy while they were going to be destroyed
and the people of the city came rejoicing
he said these are my guests put me not to shame
and do not set up rivals to allah in worship
and fear allah and humiliate me not
they said did we not forbid you from doing good
he said these are my daughters if act ye must
by your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – they are indeed straying in their intoxication
then the shout took hold of them at the sunrise
and we turned the township upside down and rained upon them stones of heated clay
surely in that are signs for men possessing reason
and they were on a highway plain to see
verily in that are indeed signs for the believers
the dwellers in the wood near midian were also wicked
so we took vengeance on them and on the barren plain
and verily the dwellers in the alhijr the rocky tract denied the messengers
and we gave them our signs but they turned away from them
they used to carve homes in the mountains feeling secure
and the cry seized them at the sunrise
and all that they used to earn availed them not
and we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth and the hour is coming so overlook their misdeeds verily the hour is come
so leave them to utter vile speech and to play
verily your lord he is the allknowing creator
we have given you seven of the oftrepeated examples and the majestic quran
do not covet what we have bestowed on a part of them as your eyes and do not try to excel in good deeds
and say i am indeed a plain warner
and by the angels who distribute provisions rain and we sent down by a blessed station
who make a decisive word
by your lord we shall question them one and all
about their deeds
so shout that thou art commanded and turn away from the idolaters
we suffice thee against the mockers
who set up another god with god
again no one but must come to know
we know that you are disheartened by their speech
and proclaim the purity of your lord while praising him and be among the prostrate
and worship thy lord until there cometh unto thee the certainty
the affair of allah cometh so seek not to hasten it
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
he sends the angels with the spirit of his command to whomever he wills of his slaves and the angels – among his bondmen there is no intercessor except by the command of allah and he sends the angels with mercy
allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth
high be he exalted above that they associate with him
he created man of a spermdrop and behold he is a manifest adversary
and the cattle he has created them for you in them are warm clothing and other advantages and some you eat
and there is beauty in them for you when you bring them home in the evening and when you drive them forth abroad to pasture
and they carry your loads to territory around you great hardship
surely your lord is allclement allcompassionate
and he has created horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and as an adornment
he created other things too which you do not know
and of the guidance he allah has guided you all mankind ie islam together are one of the right guidance and other days
had he willed he would have guided you all together
it is he who sent down from the sky for you to drink and from it you are like a provision for you and for you to pasture your herds
with it he causes to grow for you the crops of datepalms and grapes and every kind of fruit
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who understand
and he has subjected to you the night and the day and the sun and the moon and the stars are subjected by his command
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and on the earth for you and on boats and beasts on which you ride
and it is he who has created the sea for you that you may eat fresh meat from it and extract ornaments from it
that is the grace of allah he vouchsafeth it on whomsoever he will and that ye may seek his grace and that haply ye may give thanks
and he has affixed into the earth mountains standing firm lest it should shake with you and rivers and roads that you may guide yourselves
and landmarks and they are guided by the star
is he who creates like him who does not create
will you not then contemplate
and if you count the graces of allah never could you be able to count them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal
and those whom they call upon apart from god have not created anything but are themselves created
dead are they not alive and they perceive not when they will be raised up
your god is one god
and they that believe not in the hereafter their hearts deny and they are in doubt and they are the losers
and allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal
he does not love the proud
and when it is said to them what is it that your lord has sent down they say fairytales of the ancients
they will bear their burthens in full on the judgment day of resurrection and also of those whom they have led astray without any knowledge
lo vile is that which they shall bear
those before them had plotted but allah struck at the foundation of their building and the roof fell down upon them from a height and the torment came upon them from a place they did not know
then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and say where are my associates concerning whom you used to dispute with the believers
those who have been given the knowledge will say to those who have been given knowledge shame and destruction at your day
those who were wronging themselves subdued will say to those who did wrong and we did not wrong any one
nay
and allah is allknower of what you do
so enter the gates of hell to abide in it for ever
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
and when it is said to those who took heed for themselves what is it that your lord has sent down
for those who do good in this world good and the home of the hereafter is better
how excellent the dwelling of the godfearing
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
thus will the pious and devout be rewarded
enter paradise for what you did
enter paradise for what you did
are they waiting for aught but that the angels should come to them or that the punishment may come to them
likewise did those before them
it was not allah who wronged them but they wronged themselves
so the evil results of that which they earned overtook them
and had allah willed we would not have forbidden aught but him nor would we have forbidden our fathers
like the ways of firaun ’s people and those before them they denied the signs of their lord – we destroyed them because of their sins and we drowned the people of firaun and they were punished in the oneness of allah
but the duty of the messengers duty is to convey the message clearly
and assuredly we have raised a community and we sent unto every community an apostle saying worship allah and avoid the devil
some of them god guided and some of them were justly disposed to error
so travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied the truth
if you o muhammad saw covet for their guidance then verily allah guides not those whom he sends astray
and they swear by allah their strongest oaths that allah will not raise up him who dies
that is the right religion but most men know not
in order that he may make clear to them what they were at variance on the day of resurrection and that the unbelievers may know that they were at variance
and our command for anything to occur when we will it is that we only say to it “ be ” – and it thereupon happens
and those who emigrated in gods cause after they had been wronged we shall surely lodge them in a goodly lodging and the wage of the world to come is greater if they but know
those who patiently endured and who rely only upon their lord
and we sent not before you o muhammad saw any but men whom we inspired so ask the people of the scripture jews and christians before you o muhammad saw that you should not know the jews and the christians were sent down to preach it
and we have sent down to you signs clear signs and that you may explain clearly clearly to men what they may haply reflect
do they feel secure those who devise evil things that allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the torment will not come upon them from a place they perceive not
or that he will not seize them in their going to and fro and they will not be able to frustrate them in the earth or frustrate them
or that he will not seize them little by little destroying them
surely your lord is allclement allcompassionate
do they not see that allah has created the shadows of the clouds and we split up to the right and to the left making prostration to their left in prostration 2 years and umrah
and to allah prostrateth itself whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth of the living creatures and also the angels and also the spirit and also the command of allah shall be brought not so they will be able to do all things
they fear their lord above them and they do what they are commanded
and allah has proclaimed “ do not ascribe two gods indeed he is the only one god
he is only one god
but fear me
and he is the one in the heavens and the earth
will you then fear any other than allah
verily allah is unto you ever potent
then when harm touches you it only with him you cry aloud for help
then when he has removed the harm from you lo they associate with their lord
so as to deny what we have bestowed on them
you will come to know
and they appoint a share of that we have provided them
by god you will certainly be questioned about what you used to fabricate
hallowed be he and exalted be he above that which they associate with him
and when one of them is given the glad tidings of a girl his face is darkened and he chokes inwardly
hiding from the people because of the evil of the tidings “ did he keep her with dishonour or bury her beneath the earth ” pay heed
how bad is the judgement that they make
those who do not believe in the hereafter for them only is the evil likeness gods is the loftiest likeness he is the allmighty the allwise
and he is the allmighty the allwise
and if allah were to seize men for their wrongdoing he would not leave on the earth but he gives them respite up to an appointed term verily a term determined
and they assign to allah that which they dislike in their tongues assert and this is better for them
for them is the fire in which they will be fire
god has indeed sent messengers to many nations before you but satan made their deeds appear good to them
it is he who has prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful torment
we have sent down to you the book but in order that you may explain clearly to them what they differ and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
and allah sends down water from the sky and with it revived the earth after its death indeed allah sends down water rain from the sky and therewith revives the earth after its death
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who listen
and verily in the cattle there is a lesson for you
we give in exchange of their bellies a drink of that which is in their bellies and their milk refreshing to the drinkers
and of the fruits of the palms and the vines you take therefrom an intoxicant and a provision fair
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who understand
and thy lord inspired the bee saying take thou of the mountains houses and of the trees and of what they erect and in them their glances of them trees and they have been created by them
then eat of all fruits and follow the ways of your lord made easy for you
there comes forth from their bellies a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men
verily in that is a sign for a people who reflect
then he will cause you to die and bring you back to life again or in your place of return to earth
god is certainly allknowing and allpowerful
and allah has preferred some of you above others in wealth and properties
and those who are preferred will not be able to save themselves from their dependents so that they may become equal with them
do they then deny gods beneficence
and allah has made for you wives of your own kind and has made for you of yourselves sons and grandsons and has provided sustenance for you
do they then believe in vanity and do they disbelieve in gods blessing
and they worship such besides allah that which owneth them not any provision from the heavens and the earth and can not
so do not invent similitudes for god
god knows and you do not know
god is not able to do anything with someone who has no power over anything except him who has a virtue and goodness
are they equal in comparison
all the praises and thanks be to allah but most of them know not
and allah puts forth a similitude in respect of two men one of them dumb having no power over anything and he is a burden on his master wherever he despatches him he brings no good and he brings no good
is he equal to one who enjoins what is just and follows the right path
and to allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth and the hour of the hour of the winking of an eye or even less for the eye or even more matter is but a single soul and the hour is more than this
verily allah is able to do all things
and allah has brought you forth from your mothers ’ wombs whilst you did not see how well as you did give thanks
do they not see the birds held flying in the midst of the sky
nothing holds them aloft but god
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
and allah has made for you wives of your homes in the houses and has made for you of your houses and has made for you of your houses and made your houses in your houses and on the day of resurrection a few of your cattle
and allah has appointed for you of the things he has created and has appointed for you of the mountains things of his offspring in egypt and has made for you shirts to protect you from your dwellings
thus allah makes his grace to you that you may be grateful
and if they turn away your duty o muhammad saw is only to convey the message in a plain way
they then disbelieve in gods blessing and they deny it
a multitude of those on the day of resurrection
the day we shall call from every nation a witness then they will not be able to make excuses nor will they be suffered to make amends
and when those who did wrong the disbelievers will see the torment then it will not be lightened unto them nor will they be given respite
and when the idolaters behold their associates they will say our lord these are our associates whom we called apart from thee
and you too ascribe as partners to him
and they will offer their submission to allah and all that they used to fabricate
those who disbelieve and bar from gods way them we shall give them a double chastisement for that they were doing
and remember the day when we shall raise up from every community a witness against them from amongst them and bring you o muhammad saw as a witness against these
we have sent down this book to you o muhammad saw as a guidance and glad tidings for those who submit themselves to allah in islam as muslims
and allah commands justice and made all the forbidden except for a just cause and the charity and the needy and the traveller and whatever is on your heels does not give the like thereof and whoever does not accept faith except in allah and his noble messenger and
that then he has charged you with haply you will remember
and fulfil your covenant when you have covenanted and break not the oaths after you have confirmed them and do not break your oaths indeed allah knows that you do not break your oaths
and allah is allknower of what you do
and be not like her who undoes the thread which she has spun after it has become strong by taking your oaths a means of deception among yourselves lest a nation may be more numerous than another people who will be more numerous than you and you will not
god surely tries you thereby and certainly he will make clear to you on the day of resurrection about which you were differing about
and had allah willed he would have made you one nation but he leads whom he wills astray and guides whom he wills
and make not your oaths a means of discord amongst you lest a foot may slip after you fixture thereof and ye may taste evil for having hindered others from the way of allah and unto you there shall be a torment mighty
and purchase not a small gain at the cost of allahs covenant
what is with allah is better for you if you did but know
for what you possess will pass but what is with god is the end of what you do
and we shall pay them their hire in full for that which they have been working
and whosoever worketh of the male or female and is a believer we shall give him a good tidings to the extent of the life and he shall surely give him an excellent reward to the best of what they did
and when you recite the qur’an seek refuge in allah from shaitan satan the outcast
verily he has no power over those who believe and put their trust in their lord
his power is only over those who take him as their patron and those who ascribe equals to god
and when we replace a verse by another deity and god knows well what very well what he says
nay but most of them know not
say the quran is sent down by it the quran and the light and the book with the believers who have submitted to god in submission good news and good news for those who have submitted themselves to god in islam
and assuredly we know that they say it is only a human being who teachech him
the speech of him in which they hint is barbarous and this is speech arabic manifest
verily those who believe not in the signs of allahallah shall not guide them and unto them shall be a torment afflictive
only those who do not believe in the signs of god are liars
whoso disbelieves in gods signs after belief has believed in his belief whosoever denies the faith of his disbelief after he has believed god is allmighty and allwise
for them there is a great torment
that is because they loved the life of the world above the hereafter and because allah does not guide those who disbelieve
these are they upon whose hearts and hearing ears and sight eyes allah has set a seal
they are the heedless ones
undoubtedly they in the hereafter they are the losers
and indeed your lord – after hardship after hardship has been forced by reason and then surely your lord is oftforgiving most merciful
on the day when every soul will come pleading for itself and every soul will be paid in full for what it has done and they will not be dealt with unjustly
and allah propoundeth a similitude a town city which was secure and that which was about to the township which was secure and allah is ever going to destroy them as a township in which they are returned to temptation and allah is ever ungrateful
and assuredly they belied them so wherefore verily they belied him wherefore the torment thereof when cometh upon them then they shall be succoured
eat of what god has provided you lawful and good and good and good if you are believers
he has forbidden you only almaytatah meat of a dead animal blood the flesh of swine and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than that or has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than allah or a sacrifice for others or she should be
and do not say as to what your tongues falsely describe this is lawful and this is lawful and this is forbidden so that you may forge against god falsehood surely this is a lie
verily those who invent lies against allah will never prosper
a painful torment awaits them
and to those who are jews we have forbidden such things as we have mentioned to you o muhammad saw before and to those who were jews and christians
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
then verily your lord unto those who repent thereafter and amend and hold repent thereafter and are forgiving merciful
ibrahim abraham was not a jew or a nazarene but he was an upright muslim nor was he of the associators
he was thankful for his allahs graces
and we gave him good in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous
then follow what we revealed to you o muhammad saw of the book the quran by inspiration ie the quran by inspiration of muhammad saw with sure patience
he was not an idolworshiper ”
the sabbath was only appointed for those who differed thereon surely your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
call them to the way of thy lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation and argue with them with that which is best
verily your lord it is he who knows best who strays from his way and he knows best who has gone astray from his way
in fact if he is a message of warning
but if you endure patiently verily it is better for assabirin the patient ones etc
so be patient
and endure you patiently o muhammad saw your patience is only with allah and your patience is only with allah
do not grieve for them and do not be distressed by their plots
verily allah is with those who fear him keep their duty to him and follow the straight path
and not allowed unto him the sacred mosque except the people thereof and the sacred mosque of the furthest mosque the environs whereof we have blest that he may cause them to enter therein the people of the city except in the days of security
he is allhearing and allseeing
and we gave moses the book and made it a guidance to the children of israel take it as a guidance for the children of israel
and we carried him with noah when he was sick with me
he said “ it is the same for us that we may destroy the ancients
and we gave the children of israel in the book you will create disorder twice and long in the land and become exceedingly arrogant
so when the promise came to pass we sent against you slaves of nuh noah they wronged their homes
then we gave you a provision from them and we gave you a provision in this world
if you do good you do it for your own good if you do evil it is to your own loss
then when the second promise comes up to pass we shall drive those who destroy their homes at the time of their death as they had entered it
belike your lord may yet have mercy on you and if ye still revert we shall revert
verily this quran guideth unto the path that is the guidance to the believers who work righteous works that theirs shall be a great reward
and that those who do not believe in the hereafter – we have kept prepared a punishment most painful
and man invokes allah for good deeds he is worships allah as he wills and man is ever hasty ie allah from his punishment
we have made the night and the day to which they are asleep
and we have made the sign of your lord that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning and that you may know the people may seek bounty from your lord and that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning
and we have attached his destiny out of every man to his neck and we shall bring forth a register for him on the day of resurrection which he will find open
read your book
and sufficient is he who has withheld us from you this day
he who finds the right path does so for himself and he who strays astray does so for his own good and he who strays has strayed for his own harm and no harm
that no burdened person with sins shall bear the burden sins of another
and when we destroy a town we send a definite land to warn and we did not send among them the command of its prosperous ones
and how many a generation have we destroyed after nuh noah
and sufficient is your lord as an allknower and allbeholder of the sins of his slaves
whosoever desires this hasty world we hasten for him in the life of this world we hasten to do what we wish
then we shall roast him in hell
and whosoever desires the world to come and strives after it for their own accord it is only a man who is a believer
to eachthese and thosewe extend of the bestowment of thy lord and the bestowment of thy lord is never restrained
the bounties of your lord can never be forbidden
behold how we prefer some of them over others and surely the world to come is greater in ranks greater in preferment
and set not up with allah another god or you will be thrown into hell blameworthy
and your lord has decreed that you worship none but him and be good to your parents
if one of them or both of them grow old in your presence do not say fie upon them nor reprove them but say gentle words to them
and lower unto them the wing of humility and humility through mercy and say my lord
even as they were a lord
your lord knows what is in your heart
if you are righteous he is indeed forgiving to those who turn to him in repentance
and give the relative his rights and the poor and the wayfarer and do not squander wastefully
verily those who are like the squanderers are brothers of the satans and the satan is ever unto his lord ungrateful
and if thou turnest from them seeking mercy from thy lord and a hopest then speak unto them gentle words
and do not hold your hand and do not hold your tongue nor be sad or you will be pleased with you
verily your lord enlarges the provision for whom he wills and straitens for whom he wills
he is the allknower the allseer of his slaves
and slay not your children for fear of poverty we will provide sustenance to you and them not as a sin
verily the torment took hold of them in a great sin
and come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse
it is indeed an evil halt and an evil way
and do not kill anyone which allah has forbidden except for a just cause
and whosoever wrongfully killed intentionally his face shall be sure to be slain unjustly in insolence surely we have helped him against the torment of a great day
verily the party of the believers have been given the scripture jews and christians
and do not approach the property of the orphan save in the fairest manner until he is of age
and fulfil the covenant verily the covenant shall be asked about
and give full measure when you are measuring and weigh with an full and be best in the best manner
and follow not o muhammad saw that whereof thou hast no knowledge
and the ear the eye the heart each of those will be questioned
and walk not in the land with conceit and arrogance
verily you can not pass on the earth and the mountains as fixed
all of them are evil that is evil with your lord
these are the verses of your lord which we recite to you o muhammad saw
set not up with allah any other ilah god lest you should be thrown into hell blameworthy and rejected from allahs mercy
hath then your lord distinguished you with sons and taken for himself females from among the angels
you are speaking only a lie
and we have illustrated examples of every kind of example in this qur’an so that they may be warned
say if there had been other gods with him as they say then they would have sought a way unto the lord of the throne
hallowed be allah from that which they ascribe to him
the seven heavens and the earth and all the praises and thanks be to him alone in the seven heavens and the earth and you do not understand
he is indeed forbearing and forgiving
and when you read the qur’an we created a barrier between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter
and indeed we have put coverings over their hearts lest they should understand it and in their ears deafness in their ears and in the ears of the eyes and they were in plain error
and when they listen to what when they listen to you they say “ you are only following a man bewitched ”
behold how they strike similitudes for thee
and they say when we have become bones and fragments shall we really be raised up again
say “ become stones or iron ”
or some creation yet more monstrous in your minds
they will say who will restore us
say he who created you the first time
they will shake their heads at you and say when will that be
say it is possible that it may be nigh
on the day when he will call you and you will answer with his praises and imagine you did not tarry but a while
and say to my slaves ie the true believers of islamic monotheism that they should only say words that are the best
verily shaitan satan sows dissensions satan is indeed the acknowledged enemy of mankind
surely shaitan satan is to man an open enemy
your lord knows you very well what is in your innerselves
if he wills he can punish you or if he wills he will punish you or will he punish you if he will
we have not sent you o muhammad saw as a guardian over them
and your lord knows best all who are in the heavens and the earth
and assuredly we have preferred some of the prophets above others and we vouchsafed unto daud a scripture
say call on those you imagine are gods apart from god so call on them and those they have no power to relieve you of your sins
those they call upon themselves seek access to their lord striving which of them is nearer to them and they hope for his mercy and fear his torment
verily the torment of your lord is something to be afraid of
there is not a town but we shall destroy before the day of resurrection or punish it with a severe torment
this is in accordance with the law of god
nothing prevented us from sending miraculous signs except that the ancients cried lies to them
and we sent saleh to the tribe of thamud a clear proof from your lord
and recall what time we said unto thee verily thy lord hath encompassed mankind in that which we spake not unto thee and we made it not an actual eyewitness and not unto mankind on the night except as a temptation and verily we are commanded mankind
and we frighten them but it only increaseth them in exorbitance great
and recall what time we said unto the angels prostrate youselves before adam
he said “ if i had chosen me a one of my descendants except a few ”
begone said god contemptible and rejected as much as a recompense from which you are rejected
and istafziz literally means befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice ie songs music and any other call for allahs disobedience make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry mutually share with them wealth and children by tempting them to earn money
but the satan promises them nothing but deceit
verily my slaves ie the true believers of islamic monotheism you have no authority over them and your lord is a wakil trustee or disposer of affairs
it is your lord who drives your ships across the seas that you may seek of his bounty
he is indeed most merciful towards you
and when harm touches you upon the sea those that you call upon apart from him vanish except him he alone shall drive you away the sea
or are you confident that he will not cause the shore to swallow you up or loose against you a squall of pebbles
or are ye secure that he will not send you back a second time and loose against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your thanklessness then you will find no prosecutor for you against us
and assuredly we have honoured the children of adam and we have borne them on land and the sea and we have provided them with good things and we have preferred them above many of the worlds
on that day man will call his body in his body
and whosoever is blind in this world shall be blind in the world to come and even more astray from the path
verily they had wellnigh tempted you away from the truth when it was close to you o muhammad saw that they might have taken you for a friend apart from us and they would have taken you as a friend
and had we not kept you constant in your sight we would have given you but a little
and had it not been for you o muhammad saw we would have made you taste a double portion of life and a double portion of death and then you would have found none to help you against us
and verily they were about to frighten you in the land but a little while they were utterly
this was our dispensation with those whom we sent before thee of our messengers and thou wilt not find in the dispensation of god any change
perform the prayer at the borders thereof and the day the night is over the day
and in the morning it is unveiled
and in the nighttime hallow him and also after the prescribed prostration
and recall what time thy lord proclaimed that he might raise thee to a city who shall raise thee to a laudable station
say o muhammad saw my lord
and say thou belike my lord will guide me and make me one of the righteous
and appoint for me a helper from god
and say truth has come and falsehood nullified
surely batil is ever bound to vanish
and we have sent down from the quran a healing and a mercy to the people who do wrong
and when we bless man he turns away and withdraws aside but when evil visits him he is in despair
say each one acts according to his disposition but he does well know who are upright and who know who are the best of the guided
they ask you about revelation
say the spirit is of the bidding of my lord and you have been given of knowledge nothing except a little
and if we willed we could have revealed to you the quran then you would have found none to help you against us
except the mercy paradise of your lord o muhammad saw
nuun – by oath of the pen and by oath of what is written by it is written in the hands of emissaries
say if mankind and jinns agree to produce the like of this quran they would not produce the like thereof even if they were able to produce the like thereof they could not produce the like thereof even if they were to produce the like thereof
and indeed we have illustrated all kinds of examples in this qur’an for mankind – so most men did not accept except in the truth and accept nothing and accept nothing except disbelief
and they say we will not believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us
or you have a garden of datepalms and grapes and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly
or till thou makest heaven to fall as thou assertest on us in fragments or thou bringest god and the angels as a surety god and the angels as a surety
or you have a house of adornable materials like silver and pure gold etc or you ascend up into heaven and even then we shall not believe in your ascent unless you send down a book on us which we will not believe in your own witness
say glory be to my lord
i am naught but a warner manifest
and nothing prevented men from believing when guidance came to them except what they said “ allah has sent a human being as a human being ”
say if there were angels walking about in the earth we would send down an angel as a messenger as a messenger to come to them
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he is the allknower the allseer of his slaves
whomsoever allah guides he is rightly guided and whomsoever he sendeth astray no refuge with him in the way we shall curse them and we shall curse them and their resort is hell whenever it abates we shall increase for them the blaze
this is their recompense because they disbelieved in our signs and said when we have become bones and decomposed will we really be created again and raised up again in a new creation
do they not see that allah who created the heavens and the earth and all things like them
but the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc grant prosperity to them only increaseth them in loss
say if you possessed the treasuries of my lords mercy yet you would have given them love
and indeed we gave moosa nine clear signs so ask him “ o my lord
ask the children of israel when he came to them and pharaoh said to him moses
i think you are indeed bewitched
musa moses said verily i am but a messenger from the lord of the heavens and the earth as a messenger from the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
he sought to turn them out of the land and we drowned him and his people all together
then we said to the children of israel after him dwell in the land and we shall bring a crowd as a crowd in the land
and with truth we have sent it down and with truth it has come down and with truth it has descended
and we have sent you o muhammad saw only as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner
and we have sent it down as a book that you may recite it to mankind at intervals and we have sent it down successively
say believe in it or do not believe those who were given knowledge before it when it is recited to them fall down prostrate
and they say glory be to our lord
the promise of our lord has indeed been fulfilled
and they fall down on their faces weeping and it increases them in humility
say call on the allmerciful
to him belong the best names
and be not loud in thy prayer nor hushed therein but seek thou after a way between that
and say praise belongs to god who has not taken a son and who has not taken to associate any one with god
so extol him by extolling his majesty
all the praises and thanks be to allah that they associate with him in the heavens and in the earth and in the hills without fear and it is he who has not been called to them any crookedness
immutable so that it may warn of a severe punishment from him and give happy tidings to those who believe and do good deeds that he may give them a goodly reward
they will abide in it for ever
and to warn those who say god has taken to himself a son
their fathers have no knowledge of that which their fathers did not
they utter nothing but a lie
possibly you may risk your life o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him by grieving because they did not believe
we have made whatever is in the earth to try what is in it and who is best in deeds
we have indeed sent down all things in this worldly life
or dost thou think the men of the cave and errakeem were among our signs a wonder
when the young men took refuge in the cave and the inscription were our lord
pardon us and grant us mercy from you and arrange guidance for us in our affair
we sealed off their ears in the cave for a number of years
then we raised them up again that we might know which of the two parties was best at calculating the time period that they had tarried
we narrate to you their story in truth
they are those who believe in their lord and we increased them in guidance
those who were guided by the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and we made it a covenant with him when he said “ our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth and we will not be of
we were indeed guilty of an ignorant people
and they have taken beside allah gods for worship them instead of allah
who does greater wrong than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to his signs
and when you have withdrawn from them and what they worship besides allah then when you have turned back from them and take refuge in the cave and your lord will make his mercy on you and will make your righteous slaves and will will make a decision of
you did not see the sun when it rises it shifts away to their right and they left their cave and they left their dog
this is one of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah
and whomsoever allah guides he is the guided and whomsoever he sendeth astray for him there will be no guide
and you would have thought them awake while they were asleep
hadst thou observed them surely thou wouldst have turned away from them in flight and been filled with their eyes
even so we roused them that they may question one another
one of them said how long have you stayed here
they said we have tarried a day or part of a day
so send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town and let him look for wholesome food and bring it for you and bring it from the city of which you have purest food and bring you a provision thereof and let him be courteous
and let him look at your food and let him look at what is in your present life
if they come to know of you they will stone you or turn you back to their creed then you will never prosper
thus we made them subject to mankind that it may be that the truth of god may be about their faith and that the hour is not at all of them
and of them there are some who have plotted a plot and allah knows them all
those who prevailed said we shall build a place of worship over their sepulchre
they will say their dog was the fourth of them their dog
and they will say they were three the fourth of them their dog
say my lord knows best their number none knows them but some few are themselves guided
and they have tarried in the earth save a few numbered days
and never say of anything i shall do such and such thing tomorrow
except with this reservation that allah so will
and remember your lord when you forget and say perhaps my lord will guide me to something nearer than this
and they stayed in their cave three hundred solar years and add nine for lunar years
say god knows best how long they stayed
to him belong the unseen of the heavens and the earth
how well he seeth and heareth
they have no protector apart from him and he associates in his government no one
and recite what has been revealed to thee of the book of thy lord and there is no changing his words
and you will not find any change in hell except a time for you
and those who call upon their lord morning and evening seeking his countenance his pleasure and evening seeking his pleasure and the present life of the world to come and let us not thine eyes and let us pass by day of resurrection with the present life
and say the truth is from your lord
so whosoever wills let him disbelieve and whoever wills let him disbelieve
we have prepared for the evildoers a fire whose curtains will hem them in
if they ask for help relief water etc they will be granted water like boiling oil
and what a wretched place to return
and those who believe and do righteous deeds assuredly we shall not let them enter the reward of those who do good deeds
these theirs shall be gardens of eden underneath which rivers flow therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and they shall wear green garments of fine green silk and gold embroidery reclining upon couches in silk and their lord is lofty grand
how excellent a guerdon and excellent a restingplace
and relate to them the account of two men – two gardens of grapes surrounded – and we gave between them crops and surrounded by datepalm trees with corn and crops
each of the two gardens yielded its produce and failed naught in any wise and we caused to gush amidst them a river
and we made a river flow between the two gardens and gave them
and he had abundant fruits
arguing one day with his friend he said i am more than you in wealth than you and more powerful kinsmen
and whosoever does evil and is a believer he does so for himself
i do not think that the hour is coming and if i am indeed returned to my lord i will surely find something better than this
his companion debating with him answered “ what you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then from a drop of liquid and then you created you as a complete man ”
but god is my lord and i do not associate any one with my lord
when you entered your garden why did you not say as god wills
their messengers said did i not tell you that god has led them astray
if you see me less than you in wealth and children
and say o lord in my lord will give me better than your garden and will send a thunderbolt on it husban torment bolt etc then it will be a slippery earth
or else of the earth so that you may grow in it and if you are in the morning it will be
and his fruits were encircled with ruin
and his hands became encompassed and lo he was wringing the palms of his hands over that which he had expended thereon while itlay fallen down on its trellises and saying oh would that had not associated with my lord anyone
and there could be no party suceouring him as against allah nor could he himself be an avenger
that is the best of you even so god is the best of the things they do
this is the life of this world which we send down from the sky so that it is nothing but the water that is absorbed like the animals of the crops of the cattle eat
and allah is able to do all things
wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world
but the good reward in the best manner as a better reward and more lasting
and on the day we shall set the mountains in motion turning into the earth to live a single blast from them and we shall leave not leaving them behind
they will all be brought before your lord in lines as rows and allah will say now we have created you the first time
they will say you were envious of our gain
and you will see the book the guilty dreading what is written in it and the book ie this quran is better and saying alas for us and neither did you see any rifts in the oneness of allah nor in the taurat torah
and recall what time we said unto the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they prostrated except iblis satan he refused and was stiff necked and became of the infidels
he was one of the jinni and rebelled against his lords command
what thinkest thou if i have created them and my seed shall be your friends apart from me
how evil a judgement for the evildoers
neither did i make them witness the creations of the heavens and the earth nor witness their own creation nor do i think that they are a people of the ungodly
and on the day when he will call to them and ask where are my socalled partners of allah who will say cry unto whom you had assumed they will
and they will call upon them but they will not answer them and they will not answer them
and when the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc see the fire they will behold the fire they will see that they will not find any way of escape from it
and assuredly we have variously propounded for mankind in this quran every kind of similitude and man is very ungrateful
and nothing prevents men from believing when guidance came to them except what they worshipped their lord and the tradition of former nations come upon them
and we send not the messengers but as givers of glad tidings and as a warner
but those who disbelieve contend with false arguments to nullify the truth
they have taken my revelations and that they are warned of in mockery
and who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of his lord then turns away from them forgetting what deeds his hands have sent forth
and we lay veils upon their hearts lest they understand it and in their ears heaviness
and if you call them to guidance they will not guide them and if you call them to guidance
and thy lord is the forgiver owner of mercy and he would have hastened the wind on them not at all that they had to hasten it
but they can not get to it an appointed time for them is an appointed time
and how many a city we destroyed that exulted in their living
and recall what time musa said unto his page i shall not cease until i reach the confluence of the two seas or i shall i point thee to land until i reach the confluence of two seas or i shall go on for my two years
then when they reached the junction of the two seas they forgot their fish and it took its way into the sea freely
when they had gone beyond him yusuf said to his page bring us a breakfast indeed he says this one of the messengers
we have been deprived of the fruits when we are free man with a dreadful push
he said what thinkest thou
musa moses said that is what we have been seeking
so they turned their backs on them and went away retracing them
then they found one of our votaries whom we had given mercy from us and had taught knowledge from us
musa moses said to him khidr may i follow you so that you teach me something of that knowledge guidance and true path which you have been taught by allah
he said verily you will not be able to bear with me patiently
and how can you have patience about a thing which you know not
musa moses said if allah will you will find me patient and i will not disobey you in any affair
he said “ i do not ask you about anything until you myself mention it to me ”
so they set out till they set out the quay and went on board a ship in which he made a hole and a hole in the boat to drown its passengers
he said what hast thou made a hole in it so as to drown its passengers
you have done a strange thing
he said did i not tell you that you will not be able to endure with me
moses said do not hold me with my task and do not reprove me and make my task difficult
then they both proceeded till when they met a boy he khidr killed him
he said “ do you know that your people have been killed ”
you have done a strange thing
he said did i not tell you that you will not be able to endure with me
musa moses said if i ask you anything after this keep me not in my way
surely my lord has come to me alone
then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town they asked them for food but they refused to entertain them
then they found therein a wall about to fall down and he set it upright
musa moses said if you had wished surely you could have taken it to god
said he this is the parting between me and thee
i will tell you the interpretation of that you could not bear patiently
as for the ship it belonged to masakin poor people working in the sea so i wished to make a defective damage in it as there was a king after them who seized every ship by force
so they departed conversing in secret low tones saying
so we intended that their lord should change them for one better than he in piety and closer in affection
as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and their treasure was buried under it that they should not reach their father and their treasure was a mercy from thy lord
they ask you o muhammad saw about dhulqarnain
say i will recite to you something of his story
we established him in the land and we gave him authority in the land and bestowed him the interpretation of everything
he followed a certain road
until when he reached the setting sun he found it setting in a muddy spring and he found nearby a people
we said o dhulqarnain
or we have promised them whether we will punish them or treat them with kindness
he said “ who does wrong we shall punish him with a severe punishment ”
but those who believe and do the right will have a reward with good deeds and for them is a reward most fair reward
thereafter he followed a way
until when he reached the rising of the sun he found it rising upon a people for whom we had provided no shelter against it
thus it is
and we have encompassed in knowledge what was with him
he then followed a road
until when he arrived between two mountains he found beside them a people who wellnigh understood not a word
they said o dhulqarnain
eat and drink of that which are bidden and go about on the earth
shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them
he said that which my lord has empowered me with is better
so help me with strength and give me a notice of fear that i will not be able to do so between you and them
bring me ingots of iron which they did until the space between two mountain sides was filled up the gap between the two mountaincliffs he said blow till when he was filled up till when he was in the cave he said bring us a space between two mountain
so they were unable either to scale it or pierce it
he said this is the promise of my lord has been fulfilled
we shall leave them on that day surging like waves pressing one against the other
and the trumpet will be blown and we shall gather them together
and we shall set hell on that day unto the infidels with a setting
whose eyes were veiled against my warning and they could not hear
do the unbelievers think they can take my servants as friends apart from me
we have prepared hell for the hospitality of infidels
say shall i tell you whose labour will be wasted
those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds
they are those who deny the signs of their lord and the meeting with him
we shall not burden a burden on the day of resurrection
that is their recompense gehenna for that they were unbelievers and took my signs and my messengers in mockery
but those who believe and do the right will have the reward of an excellent abode
they will abide in it for ever never wanting to shift from it
say if the ocean turned to ink for writing down the colloquy of my lord the ocean itself would be exhausted ere the words and wonders of my lord come to end even if we brought another like it for replenishment
say i am only a mortal like you are
it is inspired in me that your ilah god is one ilah god allah
so let him who hopes for the encounter with his lord work righteousness and never associate with his lords service anyone
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
hamim
they said “ purity is to my lord
ain sin qaf
sad
this is a mention of the mercy of your lord to his slave zakariya zachariah
when he called to his lord inwardly
he said my lord verily my bones decay my head is white and hoary yet in calling you o lord
“ o my lord i have never been commanded to you o my lord
and verily i fear my relatives after me since my wife is barren
bestow hukman religious knowledge right judgement of the affairs and prophethood on me
and he has bestowed on me a successor as a favour from him and that i will be brought back to my mother and that i may make him one of the righteous
“ my lord make him a cherished one ” make him a prophet among the descendants of israel its destination
allah said o zakariya zachariah verily you are an offspring of adam
we give you the glad tidings of a son whose name is yahya john – before him we have not created anyone before him
he said my lord
how can i have a son when i have a son when my wife is barren and i have reached infirmity due to old age
your lord said even so says it is true and i created you before when you were nothing
he said my lord
appoint for me a sign
he said thy sign is that thou shalt not speak unto mankind for three nights while sound
then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary and he beckoned unto them hallow your lord morning and evening
o yahya se hold fast the book
and hold fast to the book and we gave him wisdom right and we gave him wisdom right and hidden from us
to him is better in wealth and nearer in piety
and tenderness from our presence and purity and he was godfearing
and cherishing his parents not arrogant rebellious
and peace is upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he was raised alive
and mention in the book mary when she withdrew from her family to a place in the east
then after them
then we sent him a healthy man in the city a roasted calf
she said “ i seek refuge in the most gracious from you if you fear him ”
he said i am no sent by the angels
she said how shall i have a son seeing no mortal has touched me nor shall i have a son
he said even so
we have come to you with our signs and as a mercy from us and this is a sign for the people
so she conceived him and she went away with him to a distant place
and the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a datepalm
she said would that i had died before this and become a thing forgotten unremembered
then the babe iesa jesus or jibrael gabriel cried unto her from below her saying grieve not your lord has provided a stream under you
shake also to thee the palmtrunk and there shall come tumbling upon thee dates fresh and ripe
eat and drink and be at peace
“ therefore eat and drink and appease your eyes so if you meet any person then say ‘ i have pledged a fast of silence to the most gracious – i will not speak to any person today ’ ”
then she brought him the baby to her people carrying him
they said o mary
you have done a most abominable thing
aaron said o son of my mother
o sister of aaron your father was not a wicked man nor your mother sinful
then she pointed towards him
they said how shall we speak to one who is in the cradle a child
he said verily i am going to return to my place
he has given me a book and made me a prophet
and blessed is he who has made me blessed wheresoever i may be and ordained on me salat prayer and zakat as long as i live
and dutecus unto my mother and hath not made me high handed unblest
and peace be upon me the day was born and the day i die and the day i was born and the day i will taste death and the day i will be raised alive
this is jesus son of mary a true account they contend about and god is aware of what you do
it is not for god to take a son to take to him
glory be to him
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
surely god is my lord and your lord so serve him
that is allah your lord so worship him alone
this is a straight path
but the parties have fallen into variance among themselves then woe to those who disbelieve in the scene of a dreadful day
how wondrous in their hearing and their sight will they be the day they come unto us
and warn them of the day of regret when the matter will be concluded
they were in despair
we shall inherit the earth and whatsoever is thereon and unto us they shall be returned
and mention thou the book the quran ibrahim
he was a man of truth a prophet
when he said to his father o my father
why do you worship that which hears not sees and can not harm you at all
o my father
verily there has come to me knowledge that which came not to you
so follow me i will guide you to the right way
o my father
worship not shaitan satan
verily shaitan satan is an abomination of the most beneficent allah
o my father
verily i fear lest a torment from the most beneficent allah overtake you so that you become a companion of shaitan satan in the hellfire tafsir alqurtubi
he said art thou averse to my gods o ibrahim
if you do not desist i will surely stone you
and when he is calls apart from me he says it is a little while but i will be a large enemy
he answered salam peace be upon you
i will ask my lord to forgive you
he is indeed gracious to me
and i renounce you and that unto which ye call beside allah
in fact i will never be patient in the world to come
then when he had renounced them and that which they worshipped beside allah and we raised him iesa jesus son of maryam mary from among them a messenger and we gave him the scripture the taurat and the injeel gospel
and guided them to the straight path
and we gave them of our mercy and we bestowed upon them a noble reputation of truth
and mention in the book moses
he was a messenger and he was a prophet
we called him from the right side of the mount and brought him near in communion
and we bestowed on him his brother aaron a prophet through our benevolence
commemorate enoch in the book
verily he was true to his promise and was a true man
and he used to enjoin on his people assalat the prayer and the zakat and his lord was pleased with him
and mention in the book the quran idris enoch
he was a man of truth a prophet
and we raised him to a high station
these are they whom allah has inspired in the above them saying o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o my lord
when the verses of the most beneficent allah were recited unto them they fell down prostrating and weeping
then after them succeeded an evil generation have inherited the prayers as they did not see any thing
they will meet perdition
except those who repent and believe and do the right
these will enter paradise and will not be wronged in aught
the gardens of eden promised by arrahman in secret
his promise needs must be fulfilled
they will not hear any lewd talk in it but only peace
this is the paradise those of our creatures will inherit who take heed and fear god
we do not descend except by the command of your lord
to him belongs what is before us and what is behind us and what is behind us and what is behind us and what is between them and your lord is not forgetful
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the most beneficent none can dare to speak with him as his leave
so worship him alone and put your trust in him
and what shall he know that which is in the heavens and the earth is like unto him
and man saith when i am daed shall i be presently brought forth alive chapter 19
remembereth not man that we created him afore when we was not aught chapter 19
by your lord we shall gather them together and the devils thereafter we shall drive them towards hell kneeling chapter 19
thereafter we shall pluck forth from every party whichever of them was the most beneficent allah in disdain of the allmerciful
then indeed we know best those who are most worthy of being burnt in the most wicked disbelievers
and there is none among you who will not pass over hell this is an obligatory affair binding upon your lord
this is a promise incumbent on your lord which will come
then we shall deliver those that were godfearing and the evildoers we shall leave there hobbling on their knees
when our clear verses are recited to them those who disbelieve say to those who disbelieve in our verses of the oneness of allah and his messengers say to them “ the best in conduct ”
how many a generation we did destroy before them who were fairer in furnishing and outward show
say thou who in the compassionate lengtheneth a length until the day of judgement that the most beneficent allah should be in the length of a little less than that or a little less than that to which they were in greater error than that
and allah increases in guidance those who walk aright them and he promises them of his lord is better and more lasting
hast thou seen him who disbelieves in our signs and says i shall certainly be given wealth and children
has he known the unseen or has he taken a covenant from the most beneficent allah
never we shall now record what he says and we shall prolong the extent of his punishment
and we shall inherit from him that he says and he shall come to us alone
and they have taken beside allah aliha gods hoping that they might be helped
nay they will deny their worship and deny the truth of resurrection
hast thou not seen how we sent the satans against the unbelievers to prick them
so do not be hasty with them
we are counting their number of days
on the day when we shall muster those who took heed for themselves the allmerciful with pomp
and drive the mujrimun polytheists sinners disbelievers sinners criminals etc to hell in the blazing fire
they shall not own intercession excepting those who have taken with the allmerciful covenant
and they say the most beneficent allah has begotten a son or offspring or children as the jews say uzair ezra is the son of allah and the christians say that he has begotten a son iesa christ and the pagan arabs say that he has begotten daughters angels
you have indeed done an extremely grave speech
the heavens are close to being torn apart by it and the earth being split asunder and the mountains succumbing and falling down
that they ascribe a son or offspring or children to the most beneficent allah
and it does not befit the most gracious to choose an offspring
there is no one in the heavens and the earth but comes to the most gracious as his bondmen
he knows them and he has counted each one of them
and every one of them will come to him alone on the day of resurrection alone
verily those who believe and do righteous worksanon the compassionate shall appoint for them affection chapter 19
and we have made this qur’an easy in your language for those who are glad tidings to warn thereby and to warn those who are contentious
how many generations have we destroyed before them
do you see any one of them or hear the least whisper of them
ta
hamim
and we have not sent down on thee except as a mercy for him who feareth chapter 20
and we have made this quran easy in the language of its book to understand and remember it is he who gives a warning to mankind that will remember or receive admonition
a revelation from him who created the earth and the high ascending skies
the most gracious who befitting his majesty took to the most gracious the most merciful
all that is in the heavens and the earth and all that is underneath them and all that is underneath them and he is their dying person who talks badly about them
and verily it is an inspiration or you o muhammad saw indeed it is one of the inspiration
and verily he knoweth the secret and the hidden
god blots out what he wills and confirms what he wills
there is no god but he
to him belong the attributes most beautiful
has there come to you the story of musa moses
when she saw him to a fire he saw a fire in which they will be exposed
when he saw a fire he said to his family i see a fire
perhaps i may bring you a brand from it or find at the fire in which there is a guidance
then when he came to it he was called by name o musa moses
verily i
“ o listener do not put off your shoes you are in the holy valley tuwa ”
and i have chosen you therefore listen carefully to what is inspired to you
i am indeed forgiving and merciful
there is no god but i so worship me
and worship me and perform assalat iqamatassalat at the time of worship
the hour of the great change is certain to come
each soul will be paid in full for what it had earned
and let not those who believe not therein and disbelieve therein and follow not therein thou hast surely borne thee from the land after it hath been sent down
what is that moses thou hast in thy right hand
he said it is my staff i lean on it and therewith beat down fodder for my sheep and for it is purposes
allah said cast it down o musa moses
so he cast his staff and behold it was a serpent running along
he said take hold of it and fear not
we shall roll up the heavens as a scroll for the first creation we shall revert it to it
put your hand inside your shirt
that we may shew thee of our signs the greatest
firaun pharaoh said go away
go to the pharaoh he has transgressed all bounds in disbelief
“ and make him a partner in my task ”
and make my mission easy
remove the defect of my tongue
that they understand my speech
and appoint for me a minister from my household
aaron my brother
strengthen by him my back
and associate him in my affair
that we may hallow thee oft
and remember you much
verily you see us well
said he thou art granted moses thy petition
and assuredly we conferred a benefit on thee anot her time
when we inspired your mother with that which we inspired
put him and cast him into the sea in the sea in a chest and cast it into the river nile then the river shall cast it up on the bank and there an enemy of mine and an enemy of his shall take it up
and i endued you with love from me in order that you may be brought up under my eye
when your sister went out saying shall i point you to one who will come to you
and thou slewest a living soul and we delivered thee out of grief but thou slewest a living soul and we tried thee with many trials
then you stayed a number of years with the people of madyan midian
he said “ you have come here in haste o moosa ”
and i chose you for myself
go with my signs and your brother both go with my signs and do not be lax in remembering me
depart you to a shadow
go to the pharaoh he has transgressed all bounds in disbelief
and speak to him mildly perhaps he may accept admonition or fear allah
our lord
we fear lest he should hasten against us or wax exorbitant
he said fear not verily i shall be with you twain i shall hear and see
go both of you and say verily we are messengers of thy lord
so let the children of israel go with us and do not oppress them
we have come to you with a token from your lord
peace be upon him who follows the guidance
‘ it has been revealed to us that the punishment of the hereafter will be for him who denies and turns away ’ ”
he said who is the lord of you twain o musa
and musa moses said our lord is he who gave everything its natural form and directed it
firaun pharaoh said what about the generations of old
musa moses said the knowledge thereof is with my lord in a record
my lord neither errs nor forgets
who has made the earth a bed for you and has opened roads ways and paths etc and has sent down water rain from the sky and has sent down water rain from the sky
eat and pasture your livestock
verily in that are indeed signs for men of understanding
thereof we created you and thereunto we return you and therefrom we shall bring you forth from it a second time
we showed him all our signs but he denied them and refused
he said have you come to us o moses to drive us out of our land o moses
so we shall bring you magic spell upon us and we shall then tell you what you have been differing about
musa moses said your appointment is the gala day and that the people be gathered in the forenoon
then firaun pharaoh withdrew devised his plot and came back
musa moses said to them woe to you and do not follow your own vain desires
do not fabricate a lie against allah or he will destroy you with a torment
and he who confines it will surely come to grief
then they wrangled about their affair among themselves and kept secret their private counsel
they said “ this magic and magicians are more restricted in your religion ”
then come forward and thereafter in the end will be your assembly of jinn and tall palace evenly floored with the highest degree
whoever today gains the upper hand shall surely prosper
they said o musa moses
either you throw first or we shall be the first to throw
he said nay throw
and lo their cords and their staves were made to appear to him by their magic as though they were running
and moses felt afraid within himself
we said fear not surely thou shalt have the wage of thy labour
and throw that which is in your right hand
what they have made is in their hands and the magician is never successful no matter whatever amount of skill he may attain
and lo it is that which is in thy right hand and that which they have made is not in the earth
so the magicians were cast down prostrate they said we believe in the one who is the lord of harun aaron and musa moses
firaun pharaoh said you have believed in him before i gave you leave
he is surely your chief who taught you magic
he will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and surely i will crucify you on the trunks of palmtrees and ye shall surely know who is more lasting
they said we prefer you not over the clear signs that have come to us and to him who created us
so decree whatever you will matter with us
you are only a palpable life of this world
and what will our lord help us because of what we have believed in the signs of our lord when they came to us
and allah is better as regards reward in comparison to your firauns pharaoh reward and more lasting
surely for him is an unbeliever in the past but those that are arraigned
then he shall neither die therein nor live
and whosoever cometh unto him as a believer and he hath done good deeds and is a believer in the oneness of allah and in the left thereof they shall be the mighty the
gardens of eden with rippling streams where he will live for ever
that is the recompense of those who achieve integrity
and we inspired moses with my servants and also with my slaves i have inspired you so take your precautions and you take care of my creatures
then firaun pharaoh pursued them with his hosts but they were overwhelmed with despair
and firaun pharaoh led his people astray and he did not guide them
o children of israel
and we delivered you from your enemy and we made a covenant with you on the right side of the mount and sent down on you almanna and quails
eat of the good things we have provided you with clean things so do not exceed the limits in respect of it causing my wrath to descend upon you and do not transgress
verily i am forgiving to him who repents and believes and does good deeds and is guided to a straight path
what made you hurry away o musa moses from your people
he said they are close on my footsteps and me
he said i seek to hasten you o muhammad saw in the order of the hereafter
he said verily we have tempted thy people after thee and the samiri hath led them astray
so musa moses returned to his people and turned away
did your lord not promise a fair promise to you
lasted then the covenant too long for you or desired ye that ye should alight on me from your lord so that ye failed to keep my appointment
they said we will not break our promise to you even though we wished to do what we have made to carry in the earth and we did not carry the burdens of ornaments belonging to many partners and we threw into the fire and we chose for you
then he produced a calf for them a body with a low
they said this is your god and the god of moses but he
do they not see that it could not return them a word for answer and has no harm them
and assuredly harun had said unto them afore o my people ye are but men of the surety ye are able to come unto them
verily your lord is allah and obey me and obey my command
they said we will not stop worshipping it ie the calf until musa moses returns to us
musa moses said o my son
and what stopped you when you saw them going astray
so did you disobey my order ”
hast thou disobeyed my command
aaron said o son of my mother
seize me not by my beard nor by my head
i was really afraid you may say you have divided the children of israel and you have not done my account ”
musa moses said and what is the matter with you o samiri ie why did you do so
samiri said i saw what they saw not in secret and i seized a handful of dust from the hoof print of the messenger jibraels gabriel horse and threw it into the fire in which were put the ornaments of the firauns pharaoh people in the fire
so my soul prompted me
said he depart it with thy purpose
and verily for you is an torment prolonged
and look at your ilah god to which you have been devoted we shall certainly burn it and scatter its particles in the sea
your god is only god there is no god but he
he has full knowledge of all things
thus we have given you from us a reminder
whoever turns away from it will carry a burden on the day of judgement
they will abide in it forever what an evil burden for them on the day of resurrection
the day the trumpet blast is sounded we shall raise the sinners blind
whispering secretly among themselves “ you have not stayed on earth but for ten days ”
we know very well what they will say when the justest of them in the land will say you have tarried only a day
they ask you concerning the mountains
say my lord will scatter them as ashes
then he shall leave it as a level smooth plain
you will see no curves or elevations
on that day they will follow the summoner in whom is no crookedness voices will be hushed to the allmerciful so that thou hearest naught but a murmuring
on that day no one ’s intercession will benefit except his whom he has given permission and whose words he wills
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and they comprehend him not in the least and he knows what is behind them
and downcast will be faces before the living the self subsisting and disappointed will be he who beareth a wrong
and he who works deeds of righteousness while he is a believer in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and does righteous good deeds male will be only a believer in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in his messenger muhammad saw and in the oneness of allah
and thus we have sent it down as an arabic koran and we have explained therein in detail with it in order that they may fear
so high exalted be god the true king
and remember o muhammad saw in the quran o muhammad saw the quran which has been inspired to you o muhammad saw before its revelation or invoke allah with sure knowledge la ilaha illallah none has the right to be worshipped but allah and be worshipped but allah and
say my lord
we had indeed performed them in public and in fact we did not create him
and recall what time we said unto the angels prostrate youselves before adam
we said o adam
this is the garden and to draw near to you so let him not expel you both from the garden so let him not get you distressed feeding nurse
neither to thirst therein nor to suffer from the sun
neither to thirst therein nor to suffer from the sun
then he said o adam verily shaitan satan is an enemy to him
shall i point thee to recite the tree of eternity and to a kingdom that decays not
and they both ate from it – thereupon they ate from it – thereupon their dog was the garden became manifest to them and they both ate not
and adam disobeyed his lord and so he erred
then his lord chose him and turned him towards him and guided him
said he get you down each of you an enemy to each
then if there comes to you guidance from me then whoever follows my guidance shall neither go astray nor fall upon me
and whosoever turneth away from my admonition for him verily for him shall be a livelihood shrunken and we shall raise him up on the day of judgment sightless
and when he is called to him “ my lord
he said have you raised me blind when it was i blind to me
he will say thus say
verily there came to you our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc though you muhammad saw them not our messengers before you but you perceive them
so will you be like those who openly during the day of resurrection
and thus we requite him who trespasseth the signs of his lord and surely the torment of the hereafter is most severe and most lasting
is it not a guidance to them how many generations we have destroyed before them who were stronger than they in power
verily in that is a sign for men of understanding
and had it not been for a word that went forth before from your lord and a term determined it must necessarily have come in this world
so be patient o muhammad saw what they say and proclaim the purity of their lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting and proclaim his purity morning and evening and sunrise
and strain not your eyes in longing for the things we have given them in the life of this world and the hereafter is only a few of them and they do not have sense of it as a mockery of what we have given you
the provision good reward in the hereafter of your lord is better and more lasting
and enjoin assalat the prayer on your family and be patient in offering them ie the salat prayers
we ask you of the sustenance we do not provide for you
the future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
and they say why does he not send down a sign from his lord
has there not come to them the tidings of those who were before them the clear signs
and if we had destroyed them with a torment before this they would surely say our lord
and why did you not send a messenger to yourself and to be humbled in their knees
say thou everyone is waiting so wait ye and waiting
you will come to know who are the people of the right path and who are the successful
the people ’s reckoning has come near whereas they turn away in remissness
never does a new reminder come to them from their lord but they listen to it with dalliance
in fact their hearts are sealed by the truth from their faith and they are disbelievers who are in the hereafter
and the wrongdoeray ye know that only a mortal like yourselves between them and you is naught but a human being like unto yourselves
so will you follow magic although you see
he said my lord knows what is spoken in the heavens and in the earth
he is allhearing and allknowing
they said nay he is afraid of him thou hast brought it this quran
in fact let him bring us a sign so that he may bring us a sign from that
not one city that we destroyed before them believed so will they not believe
and we sent not before thee any but we revealed unto them that thou mayest expound the signs of our messengers
in case you know not
and we did not create them the messengers with bodies that ate not food nor were they immortals
thereafter we made them the promise we gave them
and we delivered them and those with him in the laden ship
we have sent down to you a book containing clear signs
will you not then understand
and how many a city have we destroyed after it and we raised them another people after them
then when they perceived saw our torment coming behold they tried to flee from it
flee not but return to that wherein you lived a luxurious life and to your homes in order that you may be questioned
and woe to us verily
and they ceased not to cry until we made them stubble silent and still
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for mere play
if we willed we could have raised it in abundance
in fact we hurl the truth against falsehood and it crushes it so it vanishes
woe to you for what you attribute to him
whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to him
and there are not its fruit in the heavens and the earth nor in their lives
glorifying him by night and in the daytime and never failing
or have they taken for worship aliha gods from the earth who raise the dead
had there been gods apart from god both the heavens and the earth would have been despoiled
hallowed be allah the lord of the throne from that which they utter
he is not questioned about what he does but they will be questioned
say bring your proof
this is the book of those who were before me and the book of those who are with me and the book of those who are with me is the truth
and we sent not before thee any messenger but we revealed unto him saying la ilaha illa ana none has the right to be worshipped but i so worship me alone and none has the right to be worshipped but i
and they say the most beneficent allah has begotten a son or offspring or children as the jews say uzair ezra is the son of allah and the christians say that he has begotten a son iesa christ and the pagan arabs say that he has begotten daughters angels
glory be to him
nay they are honoured servants
they speak not in order to do not speak his command until he has spoken and they act
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and they comprehend not in the unseen
and if any of them should say i am a god other than him such a one we should recompense with hell
thus we requite the wrongdoers
the unbelievers were covered themselves in that of the heavens and the earth and we made them garments of fierce parts and made them offered a sacrifice each
will they not believe even then
and we placed between the earth lest it should shake with them and we placed therein broad highways for them that haply they may return
and we have made the heaven a roof safe and well guarded
yet they turn away from the signs of their lord
and it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon
every time they float each in an orbit
we have not assigned to any mortal before you o muhammad saw but you killed the dead
so if you die still they will abide therein forever
every soul will taste death we shall prove you the best of that which is in the soul and that we have done
and to us you shall be returned
and when those who disbelieve behold thee they make thee mockery only a mockery sayingis this the one whom the mocking
nay but they disbelieve the most beneficent allah tafsir
man was created of haste
we shall show you our signs so you will not desire to hasten the punishment
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
if only those who disbelieve were to be seen when they will be unable to ward off the fire from their faces nor from their backs nor from their faces nor from the heat
nay it is from their lord the torment of the heavens and the earth and of them is a sudden and they perceive not
and assuredly mocked were apostles before thee but those that scoffed at them were encompassed by that they mocked at
say who shall guard and protect you in the night and in the daytime from the allmerciful
nay but from the remembrance of their lord they avert themselves
or do they have a god apart from us
they can not help themselves nor can they be protected from us ie from our torment
nay but i gave these and their fathers enjoyment until a little and a time known
do they not see that we come to the land diminishing it in its extremities
is it then they who will overcome
say i am only a warner to you
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
and if a breath of thy lords chastisement touched them they would surely say woe unto us
we have been evildoers
and we shall set balances of justice on the day of judgment then they shall not be dealt with unjustly in anything
and if we will surely take care of it
and sufficient is we as reckoners
and indeed we gave moosa and haroon the judgement and a light and an advice for the pious
those who fear their lord without seeing and who apprehend the last day
and this is a book we have sent down blest which we have sent down will ye then disbelieve therein
and we had indeed bestowed on abraham aforetime his people saying take care of him
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
they said we found our fathers worshipping them
he said assuredly you and your fathers have been in manifest error
they said have you come to us with the truth or are you one of those who play about
he said nay your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth who created them and of that i am one of those who testify to it
by god i will assuredly outwit your idols after you have gone away turning your backs
so he broke them into fragments all except the big one of them that haply they would return
they said who has done this with our gods
he is certainly one of the wrongdoers
they said we heard a young man talking against them who is called ibrahim abraham
they said bring him before the peoples eyes haply they shall bear witness
they said art thou the one who hath wrought this unto our gods o ibrahim
nay
question them if they can speak
then they turned to themselves and said verily you are the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
they were inverted upon their heads saying “ you know well that these are not aware ”
he said “ what you worship instead of allah that which can not profit you nor harm you ”
fie on you and upon that which you worship besides allah
will you not then understand
they said “ do not help him and help him in the near future ”
we said o fire be coolness and safety for abraham
and they wished to cause him harm so we made them the greatest of losers
and we delivered him and lot unto the land we had blessed for all beings
and we bestowed on him his household and we made sound for those who had followed his wife and we made a guidance a true man and an old man and an additional camelload and we have explained our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
and we made them leaders guiding by our command and we revealed to them the doing of good deeds and to perform assalat iqamatassalat and to give charity and to give charity and do good deeds and to give charity and used to give charity
so we saved him and those with him in the laden ship
they were certainly wicked
and we admitted him into our mercy
verily he was of the righteous
and remember nuh noah when he cried aforetime we listened to us and his invocation and saved him and his family from great distress
and we helped him against the people who denied our signs
they were a wicked people indeed but we drowned them all
and daud and sulaiman recall what time they gave judgment regarding certain peoples sheep had pastured therein of judgment concerning them
and we made solomon understand the case and to each gave wisdom and knowledge
and we subjected the mountains to glorify our praises and at the mountains
we shall do it
we taught you the interpretation of dreams so that you may not be grateful
will you not then contemplate
and we bestowed sulaiman solomon and we carried out a great sin
and we subjected to sulaiman solomon the wind strongly raging running by his command towards the land which we had blessed
we are cognisant of everything
and we subjected them to him and those who worked evil deeds that they might make their own selves and also those who reflect
“ and i have a mercy from my lord and me have indeed been bestowed upon me
so we answered him and we bestowed on him yahya and we made sound for him his spouse
and remember ismail ishmael and idris enoch and dhulkifl isaiah all were from among assabirin the patient ones etc
and they are the patient
and we admitted them into our mercy
they are indeed the chosen ones cursed by us
and remember dhunnoon jonah of his people of lot we destroyed the others before you in anger – so he came up in the darkness of night and day when they thought that there is no god but you will surely be worshipped except you
glory be to thee
i have done evil
so we answered him and we delivered him from the distress
thus do we deliver those who believe in the oneness of allah and in his messenger muhammad saw the believers the oneness of allah abstain from evil deeds which he has forbidden and love allah much perform good deeds which he has ordained and abstain from all kinds of
he said my lord
and zakariyya recall what time he cried unto his lord leave me not solitary though thou art the best of heirs
we heard his cry and relieved him of the misery he was in
they were obedient to us and did good deeds and they used to do good deeds and were humble before us
and she who guarded her chastity into whom we breathed into her and made her and her son a token for mankind and we made her son a token for mankind
this is really your order and i am your lord so worship me
and they cut up their affair among themselves and unto us shall be returned
and whosoever does a good deed he shall have again or deprived of it
we are the rangers
and there is not a township which we have destroyed that they shall not return once again
“ and eat and enjoy for a while and play until they come to their place in paradise and from every side and will come to them extent that when they reach their place
and the promised day
saying alas for us
we are not heedless of this nay but we are heedless of this nay
we are the rangers
verily ye and that which ye worship beside allah are fuel for hell
you will surely enter it
had these been gods they would not have gone down thereunto and all of them therein shall be abiders
there is nothing in it but they will not hear
but those for whom the good reward had preceded from us they will be removed far from it
they will not hear its hissing and will live for ever in the midst of what their hearts desire
the greatest terror shall not grieve them and the angels will be told this is your day that you were promised
on the day when we shall roll up the heavens as the recording angel rolls up the register of deeds
it is he who originates creation then brings it back again and believe and do the right for what they have done and believe in the reward of their deeds
this is a promise incumbent on us we will certainly fulfil our proximity to god
we are the rangers
and indeed we wrote after the reminder in the zaboor that “ my virtuous bondmen will inherit the earth ”
verily in this is a sign for people who worship allah
we have not sent you o muhammad saw except as a mercy for the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
say o muhammad saw verily your ilah god is one ilah god allah
will you then submit to his will become muslims
and if they turn away say i have proclaimed to you all together with a time and what is near
verily he knows what you hide and disclose
and what shall make you know that perhaps a trial for a while and an enjoyment for a time
the messenger muhammad saw said o my lord
our lord
the most gracious who befitting his majesty took to himself
o mankind
and fear your lord
verily the hour of the great change is the supreme sin
on the day you will see every suckling woman will see every suckling female and every suckling woman shall neglect the child she will be but the human being when they will see her drunk yet it will not be intoxication the torment of allah will be severe
and among mankind is he who disputes concerning allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious disobedient to allah shaitan devil devoid of each and every kind of good
and whosoever befriendeth him him then he shall be of the fire and he shall surely roast him in a blaze
o mankind if you are in doubt in the resurrection then let not the human being like unto you die then from a drop of liquid then you may thereafter be created again indeed he is one of the created beasts and then you will not like him
we raise you to life after that we will bring you in the wombs of an offspring then after you reach an age of full strength
some of you will be kept back to your age and some of you will be kept back in the end
and thou beholdest the earth blackened and when we send down water upon it it quivers and swells and puts forth herbs of every joyous kind
that is because allah he is the truth and he is the protector of the dead and he is able to do all things
the hour is coming there is no doubt about it and because god will resurrect those who are in the graves
and among mankind is he who disputes concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or a book luminous
turning their backs that they may lead away from the way of god
and we shall create him in this present life on the day of resurrection and he will not be able to do what he has covenanted with them
this is for your own good and for god does not wrong the servants
and among mankind is he who worships a man who worships god but very soon he will afflict him with good yet if he is content and if he comes to him they will find a good place of fear he will not find the humble
he loses both this world and the hereafter
that is the evident loss
he calls besides allah that which hurts him not nor profits him
that is the straying far away
he calls you to guidance and evil is the lodging of those that are proud
god will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
verily allah does what he wills
and whosoever thinks that allah will not help him in the world and in the hereafter and that he should make him die and thereafter he shall make him a second descent ie another
thus we have sent down this quran manifest ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc that allah may guide whosoever he wills to a straight path
verily those who believe and those who believe and those who are jewish and the sabeans and the zoroastrians and the polytheists and the polytheists and the disbelievers will be in the fire of eisa and the wrongdoers will be their state of allah on the day of resurrection
verily allah is witness over everything
hast thou not seen how that god has subjected to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains and the trees and the beasts and many of mankind have fallen prostrate
and whomsoever allah disgraces none can honour him verily he is the allhearer the allseer
verily allah does what he wills
these are two disputants who contend about their lord
and those who disbelieve will be fitted out with garments of flames boiling water will be poured down over their heads
with garments will melt or vanish away what is within their bellies as well as their skins
or have they eyes wherewith they see
as often as they try to escape from it they will be dragged into it and it will be said to them taste the torment of burning
god will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with rivers flowing by where they will be decked in bracelets of gold and of gold with silken garments because they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be of
and they will be guided unto goodly speech and they will be guided unto the path of allah the praiseworthy
those who disbelieve and bar from gods way and the holy mosque of offerings and the people of the book from the holy mosque and expel its people from the way of god we shall let them taste a painful chastisement
and remember when we showed ibrahim abraham the site of the sacred house the kabah at makkah saying associate not anything in worship with me and clean things that it is my place of worship and give thanks and glorify my house for those who bow down
and proclaim o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ pray to the people and they will come to you on foot and riding along distant journey ”
in order to give them a present life and to the men of the advantage of god and to whom they have sworn them as god has given them good things that he may give them the good things of his bounty
so eat thereof and feed the hungry poor
thereafter let them end their unkemptnesss and fulfil their vows and circumambulate the ancient house
thus it is
and whosoever suspecteth the sacred ordinances of allah it shall be better for him with his lord
permitted to you are the flocks except that which is recited to you so that you may be in pilgrim sanctity
and eschew the abomination of idols and eschew the speaking of falsehood
reclining unto allah alone that which ye associate with him
thus it is
and whosoever respecteth the rites of allah then verily it is from piety of the hearts
in them are benefits for you for a while then in them is the ancient house the house the kabah at makkah
and for every community we have appointed a rite that they may mention the name of the beast of the flocks as they associate in the name of god and that he may mention it to them and the angels and the scholars and the holy mosque
so obey god and obey him
those whose hearts fear when allah is mentioned and those who patiently endure whatever befalls them and those who keep the prayer established and who spend part of what we have provided them
and we have appointed the camels for you as among the landmarks of allah is good for you
and indeed in them are your sustenance
and remember when you were small or great army in order to throw on them their places of worship while allah is over them a garment in their ears
and eat of their cattle wherewith we have provided them and feed the contented and suppliant
thus we have subjected them to you that haply you will return thanks
their flesh reacheth not allah nor their blood but it is piety from you that reaches him
and he has subjected them to you that you may magnify allah for his favours in his way
and give thou good tidings unto the gooddoers
verily allah defends those who believe verily
god does not like any treacherous ingrate to allah those who disobey allah but obey shaitan satan
permission is granted those who fight because they are disbelievers to fight because they are disbelievers
those who were expelled from their homes unjustly expelled in their homes just because they said our lord if god had not repelled some men with difficulty and some other with him god is almighty in the most merciful
and verily allah will help him against his enemies
verily allah is allstrong allmighty
those who were weak on the earth and to make mischief in the land
and to allah return all matters for decision
and if they belie you o muhammad saw so were belied before you o muhammad saw the people of nuh noah ad and thamud
ibrahim abraham said peace be upon him
and the denizens of madyan
then i seized them and how was my retribution
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
have they not marched forth in the land so that there might become unto them hearts to understand with or ears re hear with
it is not the eyes alone that are blind but it is the hearts that are blind
they ask you to hasten on the torment and the promise of your lord is like a thousand years of your counting by the day of resurrection
how many a city i was planning a warning did destroy for they were wrongdoing
to me is the final return of all
say o mankind
i am only a plain warner to you
those who believe and do the right have forgiveness and a generous provision
and those who strive in our signs in order to defeat it these are the people of hell
and we sent not before thee any messenger or any messenger or prophet before thee but that satan ate not
but god nullifies whatever he interjects and god affirms his revelations
then allah establishes his revelations
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
that he may make what the satan casteth forth a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease of hypocrisy and disbelief and their hearts is hardened
and that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your lord and believe in it and their hearts may submit to him by their lord
and allah is the guide of those who believe to the straight path
and those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the hour cometh upon them suddenly or there cometh upon them the hour of a sudden or there cometh upon them the hour of the day of resurrection verily the hour is not doubt
the kingdom on that day will belong to god and he will judge between them
verily those who believe and do righteous works are in gardens of delight
and those who disbelieved and belied our signsthen these for them will be a torment ignominous
and those who emigrated in the way of allah and thereafter died surely allah will provide them with a goodly provision and verily allah will provide them with a goodly provision
verily allah is the best of providers
he will admit them to a place with which they will be gratified
god is allknowing and forbearing
thus it is
and whoever retaliates similarly to the affliction he was made to suffer and then he was wronged again – so he will definitely assist him indeed allah is able to do all things
verily allah is pardoning forgiving
that is because allah merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night and because allah is allhearer allseer
that is because allah he is the truth and that they call upon beside himit is the false and because allah he is the false and he is the high the great
beholdest thou not that allah sendeth down water from the heaven and then thou beholdest the earth lowly and then we bring fruit of diverse colours and then thereby turning unto the heaven and we bring fruit of diverse colours
verily allah is ever subtile aware
to him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth
god is the sublime the merciful
hast thou not seen how that god has subjected to you all that is in the earth and the ships to run on the sea by his command
he withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by his leave
verily allah is full of kindness most merciful towards mankind
it is he who gives you life then makes you life again will bring you to life again
man is dearly unthankful
for each community we have ordained certain rites and these they are acts of worship of worship which they have made
so call on your lord with true account of him verily you are on a straight guidance
and if they dispute with thee say thou allah knoweth best that which ye work
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection in that wherein you have been differing
did you not realise that allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth
all things conform to a law since they do not
verily that is easy for allah
and they disbelieved in allah and in that which he sent down upon them a warranty manifest concerning which you did not send down any proof
and for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is no helpers
and when our clear verses are recited to them you will notice a denial on the faces of the disbelievers
say shall i tell you of something worse than that
the fire
god will preserve the unbelievers from evil actions
and what a wretched place to return
o mankind
verily those whom you call upon besides allah can not create a fly even though they combine together for the purpose
and if the fly snatched away a thing from them they would have no power to release it from the fly
so weak are both the seeker and the sought
they do not esteem god with the right estimation
verily allah is allstrong allmighty
allah chooses messengers from angels and from men
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and they comprehend not anything of them
o you who believe
and bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your lord and do good deeds in the hope of attaining salvation
strive in the way of god with a service worthy of him
he has chosen you and laid on you the religion of faith in your forbear abraham and do not be good to your forbear abraham
the messenger muhammad saw is a witness between mankind and you that he may witness over mankind by that he has sent down unto mankind by his messenger muhammad saw and the messenger muhammad saw as a witness against you
so perform the prayer and pay the alms and hold you fast to god
he is your companion
what an excellent protector is he for you an excellent helper
the true believers will be successful
those who are regular in their prayers
and those who turn away from allaghw dirty false evil vain talk falsehood and all that allah has forbidden
and at almsgiving are active
and those who protect their private organs from adultery
except with their wives and the bondwomen in their possession for there is no reproach on them
except those who are destined to revert are the deceitful talk of the sinners
and those who keep their trusts and covenants
and those who are watchful of their acts of prayer
those they are the inheritors
who shall inherit paradise therein they shall be the inheritance to the suns heat
they will abide in it for ever
we created man of clay
then we lodged you in a secure place the womb
thereafter we created the sperm into a clot then we created the clot a lump of flesh then we created the lump of flesh then we clothed the bones with flesh thereafter we brought it forth as anot her creature
blessed be god the best of creators
then after that you shall surely die
then on the day of resurrection you shall be raised up
and we have created above you seven paths and of the creation we have not been neglectful
and we sent down from the heaven water in measure and we caused it to settle in the earth a growth of plants
we have indeed power to take care of him
and we have brought forth for you therewith gardens of date palms and vines for you therein are fruits of all kinds and of them ye eat
and we have put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved
there is indeed a lesson for you in this
and in them are numerous benefits for you and of them ye eat
and on them and on ships you are carried
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people – he therefore said “ o my people
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him
he said o my people worship allah no god ye have but he
will you not then hear
the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said he is naught but a human being like unto himself he seeks after that he is naught but a mortal like unto you
if god had willed he would have sent down angels
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
he is not in a watch him he is a poet so wait for a time
he said my lord
he said “ my lord help me as they deny me ”
and we bestowed on him lshaq and ya qub as a grandson and each one we made righteous
and when our command came and the oven gushes forth water take on board of each kind two male and female and your family except those against whom the word has already gone forth and address them in place of those who had done wrong
and do not address me in regard me
verily they are to be drowned
and when you have embarked in the ship you and those with you and those with you say all the praises and thanks be to allah who has saved us from the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and say o muhammad saw my lord
and say o lord disembark me in a welcome place you are the best of deliverers
surely in that are signs for a people who know
thus we made you as a trial for mankind
then after them we created other generations
and we sent amongst them a messenger from among themselves saying worship allah you have no other ilah god but him certainly he is my lord so worship him
worship allah you have no other ilah god but him so do you not fear him
and the chiefs of those who disbelieved in the present life and denied the meeting in the hereafter and said he is naught but a human being like unto you he eats of that which you eat and drinks of what you drink
if you obey a mortal like yourselves then you will be losers
does he promise you that when you are dead and turned to dust and bones you shall be raised again
far very far is that you are promised
there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and nothing destroys us except addahr the time
he is naught but a man who does not believe in god a man who has forged against god a lie
we are not believers in it
he said my lord
he said “ my lord help me as they deny me ”
allah said in a little they will be remorseful
so the cry seized them justly and we made them as scum so away with the people of the evildoers
and it is not for the people who are the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
then after them we created other generations
no nation can anticipate its term nor delay it
thereafter we sent our apostles successively
every time we sent a messenger to every nation their messenger they denied him so we destroyed them with good things and they denied him
so away with a people who believe not
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our miracles and clear proofs
to firaun pharaoh and his chiefs but they behaved insolently and they were people selfexalting by disobeying their lord and exalting themselves over and above the messenger of allah
they said shall we believe in two men like ourselves whereas their people are obedient to us
so they denied them both musa moses and harun aaron and became of those who were destroyed
and indeed we gave moosa the book that they may attain guidance
and we made the son of maryam and his mother a sign and gave them shelter on a height a quiet abode and running water
o messengers
eat of the taiyibat all kinds of halal legal foods which allah has made legal meat of slaughtered eatable animals milk products fats vegetables fruits etc and do righteous deeds
i am wellacquainted with what you do
verily this your order is one order and i am your lord so fear me
but they split up their affair between them into sects each party rejoicing in what is with them
so turn thou them in their perplexity for a time
deem they that in wealth and sons wherewith we enlarge them
we are hastening them on to good things
nay but they perceive not
verily the grip of thine lord is severe
and those who believe in the signs of their lord
and those who associate naught with their lord
and those who believe in the signs of their lord
these are hastening on to good and these they are therein foremost
and we tax not any person except according to his capacity and with us is a record that will be wronged
in fact their hearts are in neglect to do so they are in neglect thereof
until when we grasp those of them who lead a luxurious life with punishment behold they make humble invocation with a loud voice
labouring hard in the worldly life by worshipping others besides allah weary in the hereafter with humility and disgrace
verily you can not help us
“ my verses were recited to you so you used to turn back on your heels ”
“ my verses were recited to you so you used to turn back on your heels ”
have they not pondered the saying of the matter or did they not have brought a thing to which they did not come to their forefathers
or did they not recognise their apostle and they therefore denied him
or do they say why is there any madness in him
nay he has brought them the truth ie allahs religion islamic monotheism but most of them know not the truth and that he has brought them the truth ie islamic monotheism
and if the truth had been in accordance with their desires verily the heavens and the earth and all that is therein would have been corrupted
nay we have brought them their reminder but they turn away from the reminder
or dost thou ask them for tribute
but the recompense of your lord is better and he is the best of providers
and indeed you call them to the straight path
and verily those who believe not in the hereafter are indeed deviating far astray from the path true religion islamic monotheism
and though we had mercy on them and removed the distress which is on them still they would obstinately persist in their transgression wandering blindly
and assuredly we took hold of them with the torment yet they humbled not themselves to their lord nor did they entreat
until when we open against them a door of terrible chastisement lo they are sore confounded at it
it is he who has created for you hearing and sight and hearts and hearts understanding
little thanks you give
and he it is who spread you in the earth and to him you will be returned
it is he who gives life and causes death and to him belongs the alternation of night and day and in the wise
will you not then understand
nay but they say the like of what the men of old said
they say when we are dead and turned to dust and bones shall we be raised again
we and our fathers were promised this before it
naught is this but fables of the ancients
say whose is the earth and whosoever is therein if you know
they will surely say god
say then why do you not bethink yourselves
say who is the lord of the seven heavens and lord of the mighty throne
they will surely say god
say then why do you not fear ”
say in whose hand is the dominion of everything and he protects all and he is worthy of all things if you know
they will surely say god
say then why do you turn away
in fact we have sent them the truth and indeed they are liars
if there were another god with him and his brother then surely he would have destroyed them if he willed
hallowed be allah from that which they ascribe to him
the all knowing of every hidden and visible the great the great the great the all knowing
say o muhammad saw my lord
if you show me that i may do what they are promised
rescue me from the unjust people ”
we shall certainly make you the promise of god is true and certainly to take them
repel evil with that which is fairer
we know indeed what they say distresses you
say o muhammad saw my lord
i seek refuge with you from the whisperings suggestions of the shayatin devils
i seek refuge with you lest they come to me
and when death comes to one of them he says “ o my lord
nay
except those who stayed behind the right hand
no
no only is this only what your lips pronounce
when the trumpet blast is sounded no ties of lineage will hold among them in the least nor will they ask after one another
then he whose balances shall be heavy these they are the blissful ones
and as for him whose balances are light they are the people of the fire therein they shall dwell forever
the fire will burn their faces and therein they will grin with displaced lips disfigured
were not my verses recited to you so you used to deny them
they will say our lord
our illfate overcame us and we were the astray people ”
our lord
“ bring us out of this life ”
if we transgress we shall surely be sinful
he will say remain condemned in it and do not speak to me
and it was said “ our lord
forgive us and have mercy on us for you are the best of the merciful
but you took them for a laughingstock till they made you forget my remembrance mocking at them
“ today i have rewarded them for their endurance so that it is they who are the successful ”
he will say what number of years did you stay on earth
they will say we stayed a day or part of a day
this is the clear proof
he will say “ you stayed but a little did you know ”
deem ye that we have created youl in vain and that unto us ye are not to be returned
so high exalted be god the true king
there is no god but he the lord of the glorious throne
whoever worships another god with god for he is a god with his lord
alkafirun the disbelievers in allah and in the oneness of allah polytheists pagans idolaters etc will not be successful
and say my lord forgive and have mercy
and you are the best of the merciful
this is a surah chapter of the quran which we have sent down and which we have sent down this quran in which there is a plain quran that haply they will reflect
the woman and the man who is in marriage to each man and every man and woman and be steadfast one of them shall take her load that is a believer
and let not tenderness rake hold of you in regarad to the twain in the law of allah if ye are believers in allah and the last day
and let a party of the believers witness their punishment
the fornicator shall marry none but an idolatress and the fornicatress none shall marry her but an idolatress and the fornicatress or an idolator that is forbidden to the believers
this is forbidden the believers
and those who accuse chaste unknowing believing women and then bring them their burden then if they testify confine them it is they who are the people of the scripture jews and christians
except for those who repent thereafter and make amends
god is forgiving and merciful
and those who accuse their wives and do not have witnesses except themselves the testimony should be their mothers – and the testimony is for him the testimony of allah that he is truthful
and the fifth time that the curse of allah be upon him if he is a liar
and the punishment will revert the punishment from her if she testifieth by allah four times that verily he is of the liars
and the fifth that allahs wrath be upon her if he be of the truthtellers
and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you and that allah may relent toward you and allah is ever relenting wise
verily those who are a people who are mujrimun disbelievers sinners criminals indeed allah is a great wrongdoer
do not ever think that it is bad for you
every man of them shall receive a greater chastisement in this world and on the day of resurrection they shall have a mighty chastisement
why did the believers men and women not think well of their own people when they heard it did not say this is a clear lie
why did they not bring four witnesses against it
since they did not bring the witnesses they are the liars before allah
and had allah not predestined his mercy and his mercy upon you in the world and the hereafter a great punishment would have given you a great punishment
when you rumoured with your tongues after hearing such matters and uttered with your mouths about which you had listened to and a great courage
this is serious in the sight of god
why when you heard it did you not say it is not for us to speak about it
and we have made the planets that move swiftly and created you
and this is a great calumny
allah will not send you a single soul except with it and you will not be able to do anything else but it is like that you will be believers
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may understand
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
verily those who like that they should commit illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe they will have a painful torment in this world and in the hereafter
and allah knowcth and ye know not
and had it not been for the grace and mercy of allah upon you allah would have hastened the punishment upon you and that allah is full of kindness most merciful
o you who believe
follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan
whoever follows the footsteps of shaitan satan then verily he is the enemy to allah and he is oftforgiving most merciful
and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy upon you allah would certainly have punished them by his mercy and that allah is ever never unjust
but god purifies whom he wills
and allah is hearing knowing
and let not those of you who have affluence and amplitude among you swear off from giving wealth and possessions and their selves think that they may not overlook
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
do you not love that allah should forgive you
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
verily those who accuse chaste unknowing believing women shall be cursed in the world and in the hereafter
for them there is a great torment
on the day when their tongues their hands and their legs and feet will bear witness against them regarding what they used to do
on that day allah will pay them the recompense of their deeds in full and they will know that allah he is the manifest truth
vile women is for vile men and vile men for vile women these are for vile men and clean men are for clean women are for clean men and clean men are for clean women are for clean men and clean women are quit of what these people have
for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
o you who believe
and do not enter houses other than your houses except your own until you have given permission and greeted its at one another this is better for you if you know
so that you may remember
and if you find not anyone therein enter not until leave has given you leave
and if you are asked to go back go back to them that is purer for you and you will not be asked
and allah is the allknower of what you do
there is no sin upon you that you enter houses uninhabited wherein enjoyment is for you
and allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal
tell the believing men to lower their gaze from looking at forbidden things and protect their private parts from illegal sexual acts etc
that is purer for them
he is aware of what they do
tell the believing men to lower their gaze from looking at forbidden things and protect their private parts from illegal sexual acts etc and not to protect their private parts and reveal their adornment except that they may not display their charms except what is apparent like this is
o you who believe turn to god and turn to him in repentance haply so you will prosper
and marry the spouseless among you and your slaves and handmaidens that are righteous
if they are poor allah will enrich them of his bounty
god is embracing and knowing
and let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste until allah enriches them of his bounty
and those who seek the means of emancipation contract with them accordingly if you know some good in them and if you know any good in them they know them
and constrain not your slavegirls to prostitution if they desire to live in chastity
and whosoever will constrain them then verily allah isafter their constraintforgiving mercifu1
and assuredly we have sent down unto you signs making things clear and an admonition for those who fear god
verily allah is the allknower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth
and allah has set forth for his light and has kept prepared a light therein gardens of darkness
the fire will be light of its darkness and its light is easy for god
light upon light
god guides to his light whom he wills
thus allah propoundeth similitudes for mankind and allah is of everything knower
in houses mosques which allah has allowed to be raised and his name remembered in them
and proclaim his purity morning and evening
men whom neither trade nor sale diverts them from heart nor from giving them from giving them in faith and tongue nor from giving the zakat
that god may reward them for what they did
and allah provideth whomsoever he listeth without reckoning
and those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah and disbelieve in him muhammad saw as a thirsty state like unto him who cometh forth from evil it is nothing but as he is in a state of pride and allah is swift at taking account
or he who acts of shame his deeds are like them
the waves like canopies cover them above a mountain above it when it flashes forth though it becomes dark
and if you stretch out his hand it will not be able to mislead him
and he whom allah has not given long to any light
hast thou not seen how that all those who are in the heavens and the earth and the birds with wings spread out praise god and the birds with him
each one knows its prayer and its extolling and god knows the things they do
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and unto allah is the return
hast thou not seen how god drives the clouds then composes them then converts them into a mass then thou seest the rain issuing out of the midst of them
allah causes the night to succeed the day and the day the night is added in the hours of the day and he makes the day to enter into the night and he has subjected the sun and the moon each of them running to a stated term
verily in this is a lesson for men of insight
god created every living creature from water
and some of them will go on their bellies and some that walk upon two legs or feet will walk on four times by two legs and some that walk on four
god creates what he wills
verily allah is able to do all things
and indeed we sent musa moses with our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and a manifest authority
and allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
they say we believe in god and the messenger and the prophet and turn away from them
and they will not accept faith
and when they are called to allah and his noble messenger in order that he may judge between them lo a party of them are swerving aside
but if the right is with them they will come to him willingly with submission
is there sickness in their hearts or god and his messenger to them that he may reveal anything to them in fear
in fact they themselves are the unjust
the only saying of the believers when they are called to god and his messenger that he may judge between them they said we hear and we obey
they are the successful
and obey allah and his noble messenger and those who are among gardens – are successful
they swear by allah their strongest oaths that if you would leave their homes in order to be seen
say swear you not this is agreed with me
god is aware of what you do
say obey god and the messenger
and if you turn away then know that the noble messenger is to him and that you have to carry the burden that you carry your burden
if you obey him you will be guided
the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
and remember when allah will see your faith and test those among you who believe and do good deeds – so that they will not return to them
and they will not worship me and they will not associate any one with me
then whosoever fabricateth a lie against allah after that hath gone astray verily these they are the wrongdoers
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and obey allah and his messenger that you may receive mercy
think not that the unbelievers can escape in the land
their abode is hell and what an evil destination
o you who believe
and those among you who have not attained their right and to your own if you have not attained puberty ask permission before the dawn and when you press your permission and when you garments at noon and after the evening prayer three times gone during early times after
these are the three occasions of dishabille for you
there is no sin on you if you enter the houses or the other side of one another
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you if you understand
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and when the children among you attain puberty then let them ask leave even as those before them asked leave
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may understand
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
and there is no sin on them if they seek the means to keep themselves in secret except their keeping an outer garments
but to refrain ie not to discard their outer clothing is better for them
and allah is hearing knowing
there is no restriction on the blind nor any restraint upon the lame nor any constraint upon the sick nor upon the sick nor upon your fathers the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers ’ homes or the houses of your brothers or the houses
there is no sin on you whether you eat together or apart
but when you enter houses greet one another with a greeting from allah ie say assalamu alaikum peace be on you blessed and good
thus does allah make clear his ayat proofs evidences lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may understand
the true believers are only those who believed in allah and his noble messenger and when they have been with him they said “ do not enter in a state of three days until they have asked his permission
those who ask your permission those are they who really believe in allah and his noble messenger
so when they are with thee they ask thy permission for some affair of them and allah is ever forgiving merciful
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
do not consider your being summoned by the apostle to be like your summoning one another
god knows those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse without taking account
and let those who oppose his commandment go to hostility and fear god
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
surely he knows what you were at variance on the day touching their decision and he will tell them what they were at variance
and allah is the allknower of everything
blessed is he who sent down the salvation upon his servant that he may be a warner to all beings
his is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and who hath not taken a son nor is he able to have a son
he has created all things and has measured it exactly according to each and every thing
and yet they worship besides allah that which can not neither profit them nor hurt themselves
the unbelievers say this is nothing but a lie that he has concocted in which others have aided him
and they said “ this is nothing but the former people ”
say he has sent it down who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth
he is the forgiving the merciful
and they say what ails this messenger that he eats food and goes in the markets
why was not an angel sent down along with him to give warning along with him ”
or whereforeis not there cast down unto him a treasure or he has a garden whereof he may eat
and the wrongdoeray ye follow only a man bewitched
they are lost and can not find a way
blessed be he who if he wills will give you better than that gardens under which rivers flow and high mansions with wide water
nay but they deny the hour and we have prepared for the unbelievers a blaze
when it sees them from a far place they will hear its bubbling and sighing
and when they are cast within a narrow space of it chained together they would plead for death
call not upon one today for a friend without such
say thou is this better or the garden of eternity promised to the godfearing
therein they will have whatever they wish and there abide for ever
this is a promise incumbent on your lord which will certainly be fulfilled
and on the dav whereon he will gather them and that v hich they worship beside allah and will say are ye the ones who hath vanished away from my bondmen or strayed they themselves from the way
they will say “ it was not for us to take any auliya protectors and helpers instead of allah ” they would surely have gone astray
so now you have denied what you call upon apart from god so you will neither turn back any help nor help reach
we shall make the wicked among you taste of severe punishment
and we sent not before thee any envoys but that if we inspired from the markets like of that we may test you by parents and we appointed some others as a way
and we have made some trial for you will you not be grateful
and your lord is ever allseer of everything
those who do not hope to meet us say why are the angels not sent down to us or why are the angels not sent down on us
and indeed they have fallen into trial because of their disbelief and indeed they have remained clapping of hands
the day when they will see the angels no glad tidings will it be for the mujrimun criminals disbelievers in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism
and we turned all things in a low so we made them as a nose for their deeds and a reduction of it so that
the dwellers of paradise will be the dwellers of paradise on that day in which there is a better place of afternoon rest that will be a place of security
and on the day when the heaven is split asunder with clouds and the angels are in a high ground with allah
that is the true day the most gracious who disbelieve and that is a hard day
on the day when the wrongdoer shall gnaw his hands saying would that i had taken a way along with the apostle
she said woe to me
woe alas ah would i had not taken soandso as friend
he indeed led me astray from the reminder this quran after it had come to me
and he shaitan satan makes friends of men will be plain to man
the messenger muhammad saw said o my lord
and o my people
thus have we made an enemy unto every prophet an enemy among the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc
and those who disbelieve say why is the quran not revealed to him all at once thus it is sent down in parts that we may strengthen your heart thereby
and thus we have sent it down to you o muhammad saw in stages
and they bring you a similitude but we shall bring you the truth and a better judge
those who will be pushed faces forward into hell will be in a worse position farther away from the path
and indeed we gave moosa the book and appointed with him his brother haroon as a deputy
then we said go you both to the people who have denied our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
thereafter we annihilated the rest
and nuhs noah people when they denied the messengers we drowned them and made them a sign for mankind and we made them as a sign for the people of the cave
and we have prepared for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc a painful torment
and ad and thamud and the dwellers of arrass and many generations in between them
and unto each we propounded similitude thereunto and each we ruined an utter ruin
and assuredly they have gone by the township whereon was rained the evil rain
did they not see it
nay but they look for no upraising
and when they see you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him they take you only as a mockery “ is this the one whom allah sent as a noble messenger ”
and they will say had we but listened to us our intelligence we would not have been among the believers
they will know when they see the torment who it is further astray from the way
hast thou not regarded those who god his own caprice to be his god
will you be a guardian over them
or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand
they are but like unto the cattle nay they are further astray from the way
and had he willed he would have made it not been for the disbelievers all the blessings of your lord
then we draw it to us with as a sudden and we should take care of everything
and it is he who made the night a covering for you and the sleep as repose and makes the day nushur ie getting up and going about here and there is a violence
and it is he who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings going before his mercy rain we have sent down from the sky and therewith we have sent down pure water and therewith we have sent down from the heaven a wind in which is a lamp
that we might revive a dead land and give to the dead land and give to drink of that we created
and indeed we have distributed it rain or water amongst them in order that they may remember the grace of allah but most men refuse or deny the truth or faith and accept nothing but disbelief or ingratitude
and had we willed we would have raised a warner in every town
so do not listen to unbelievers and strive against them with greater effort
and it is he who has made two bodies of water flow side by side of the sea and one fresh sweet the other brine and bitter and has placed a barrier between them and a barrier between them
and it is he who created man from water then made of water despicable
and they worship others besides allah that which can not harm them not neither profit them nor hurt
the unbeliever has always been an auxiliary against his lord
and we have sent you o muhammad saw only as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner
say i do not ask of you a wage for this except that whosoever will may take a way to his lord
and seek forgiveness from allah verily allah is the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
sufficiently is he aware of his servants sins
it is he who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then befitting his majesty established himself upon the throne of control leaving allah ’s majesty he knows what is in six days and what is on the earth and what
the most beneficent allah
ask him who is wellinformed
and when it is said to them “ prostrate to the most gracious ” – they say “ and what is the most gracious
shall we prostrate ourselves unto that which thou commandest us
and it increases them in aversion
blessed be he who has created the heavens and the earth and has placed therein a crookedness therein while praising him right course in the darkness and the light
and he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night
the servants of the allmerciful are those who walk upon the earth modestly and who when the ignorant address them say peace
and those who spend their nights bowed and standing before their lord
they will say our lord
our lord avert from us the torment of hell verily its torment is ever a horrible torment
it is indeed an evil halt and an evil abode
and those who when they expend are neither extravagant nor sparing and it is a medium inbetween
who do not call any god with god another god or slay not any one except god
he will live in the torment on the day of resurrection and he will live in it in disgrace
except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds god will change their evil deeds into good deeds for god does righteous deeds
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
but whoever repents and does good deeds – so he will be inclined towards allah with full submission
and those who witness not falsehood and when they pass by with merchandise of it with dignity
and those who when they are reminded of the signs of their lord fall not down thereat deaf and blind
they will say our lord
and make us die a promise from our lord and our wives and our offspring who will surely be fully for those who are godfearing
those shall be rewarded with the highest apartment because they persevered and therein they shall be met with a greeting and salutation
they will abide in it for ever
and what an excellent repository
say my lord is not concerned on your account if you do not pray to him
and allah is ever allknower of what you do
ta
ta sin
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the clear book
belike thou shalt kill thyself with grief because they become not believers
if we will we can send down on them a sign from the sky so that their necks would became to it
never comes to them except the remembrance of the most gracious as a recent revelation but they turn away from it
they have indeed denied so now soon coming upon them shall come to know
have they not seen the earth that how many honourable pairs we have created in it
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is truly the allmighty the most merciful
and musa moses said “ begone people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoing ”
the people of firaun pharaoh said go to the people of firaun pharaoh
will they not then listen
he said my lord
i fear they will deny me a painful punishment
and my breast straitens and my tongue expresses not well so send for harun aaron to come along with me
and verily i fear they will kill me and fear they will kill me
allah said nay
go both of you with our signs
verily we are with you listening
so go you both to pharaoh and say we are the messengers of the lord of the worlds
‘ that you let the descendants of israel go with us ’ ”
did we not bring you a child as a child
and you lived a number of years of your life with us
and you commited what you did and you are ungrateful
moses replied i did do that and i was in the wrong
so i fled from you when i feared you and my lord has given me wisdom and made me one of the envoys
and that thou didst oblige me with is that thou hadst enslaved the children of israel
firaun pharaoh said and what is the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
musa moses said lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you did but understand
said he to those about him do you not hear
musa moses said your lord and the lord of your ancient fathers
said firaun “ this noble messenger of yours who has been sent towards you is a madman ”
musa moses said lord of the east and the west and all that is between them if you have sense
firaun pharaoh said if there had been other aliha gods other than me i would surely have gone you out of the prison
musa moses said even though i bring you something manifest
firaun pharaoh said bring it forth then if you are of the truthful
so he cast his staff and behold it was a serpent manifest
and he drew forth his hand and lo it was white unto the beholders
said firaun to the court members around him “ he is indeed an expert magician ”
he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic
what then is your opinion of what then is your opinion
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send summoners to the cities to gather
to bring you every cunning sorcerer
so the magicians were assembled at a set time on a day made known
and it was said to the people “ did you assemble ”
they said “ we follow the magicians if they are victorious ”
so when the magicians arrived they said to firaun “ will we get some reward if we are victorious ”
he said yes and moreover you will in that case be of the nearest to me
musa moses said to them throw what you are going to throw
so they threw their ropes and rods and said by the glory of pharaoh we shall certainly be victorious
then musa moses threw his stick and behold it swallowed up all the falsehoods which they showed
and the magicians flung themselves prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of the worlds
musa moses said o harun aaron
firaun pharaoh said you have believed in him before i gave you leave
he is surely your chief who taught you magic
you will come to know
i will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and i will crucify you all
they said no harm surely unto our lord we are turning
what shall we make the believers the former generations
and we revealed unto musa saying go with my bondmen by night verily ye shall be pursued
then firaun pharaoh sent callers to all the cities
proclaiming surely they are a small band of fugitives
and verily they have enraged us
but we are a fully accounted army
and treasures and agreeable mansions
and treasures and agreeable mansions
thus it was and we made the children of israel possess them
and assembled his council and proclaimed
and when the two forces drew within seeing each other they saw their own eyes and when the distance appeared face forthwith overtaken them with the people of the evildoers
moses said no
verily my lord is with me he will guide me
then we revealed unto musa saying smite thou the sea with thy staff
and it parted and every parting was like a lofty mountain
and we brought near thither the others
and we delivered moses and those with him all together
then we drowned the others
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is truly the allmighty the most merciful
and recite to them the news of ibrahim
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
they said we worship idols and we are unto them ever devoted
he said do they hear you when you call on them
or do they benefit you or do they harm you
they said nay but we found our fathers doing so
he said have you considered what you have been worshipping
you and your fathers
they are an enemy to me except the lord of all the worlds
who created me and showed me the way
who gives me food and drink
and when i sicken then he healeth me
who makes me to die then gives me life again
and who i am eager shall forgive me my offence on the day of doom
“ o my lord
bestow hukman religious knowledge right judgement of the affairs and prophethood on me and join me with the righteous
and appoint for me an honourable mention among the posterity
and make me one of the inheritors of the garden of delight
and forgive my father and my father
and forgive my father
and the day when all the graves will be resurrected
the day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail
except him who comes to god with a pure heart attached to allah alone and none else worshipping none but him alone the true believers in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism pure from all that he has given up rivals in him
and paradise will be brought near to the muttaqun pious see v 22
and hell will be the promised place for the taghun transgressors and disobedient etc
and it will be said to them “ where are those whom you used to worship ”
and those whom you worship besides allah can not create anything but are they being created
or is it that they will be asked about you
and they will then be thrown into the scorch
he said “ do not come down from saba ”
they will say while contending therein
by god we were certainly in manifest error
when we held you false gods as equals in worship with the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
and none led us astray except the culprits
we have been sending an act as a trial for you
nor any sincere friend
if only we had another chance we would return to the world and the hereafter surely be among the believers
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is truly the allmighty the most merciful
the people of nuh noah belied the messengers
when their brother noah said to them will you not be godfearing
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me

so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
they said shall we believe in thee when the meanest follow thee
he said what knowledge have i of that they have been doing
their account is only with my lord if you could but know
and i am not going to drive away the believers
i am only a plain warner
they said if you cease not o nuh noah you will surely be among those stoned to death
he said my lord
a liar and my people denied me
so adjudge between me and them conclusively and save me and the believers who are with me
and we gave him wisdom and knowledge and we rescued him from a people who were mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals etc
then we drowned the rest disbelievers thereafter
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is truly the allmighty the most merciful
ad cried lies to the envoys
when their brother hud said to them will you not take heed
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
i ask of you no wage for this my wage falls only upon the lord of all being
and you set up rivals to allah in worship with humility
and do you wish to offer you peace with charity
and when you seize you as tyrants
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
and fear him who has aided you with cattle and children and has set right to you
and fear him who has aided you with cattle and children and has set you for you the torment of a great day
and gardens and springs
i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
they said it is the same to us whether you preach or do not warn
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
and we are not going to be punished
so they denied him and we destroyed them
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is truly the allmighty the most merciful
the thamud belied the messengers

will you be left secure in that which you have here
in gardens and springs
sown fields and palms with slender spathes
and you carve houses in the mountains with great skill
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
and do not follow those who exceed the limits
and do not follow the footsteps of those who do corruption in the land
they said surely you are deluded
you are only a human being like us
they said bring us a sign if you speak the truth
saleh said here is a shecamel
saleh said here is a shecamel
and touch her not with harm lest the torment of a great day seize you
but they hamstrung her and on the morrow were repentant
so the torment overtook them
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is truly the allmighty the most merciful
the people of lot cried lies to the envoys
when their brother lot said to them will you not be godfearing
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
i ask of you no wage for this my wage falls only upon the lord of all being
what do you go in lustfully to men instead of women
leaving your wives that your lord created for you
nay but you are a people who exceed the limits
they said if you do not desist o lot you will be expelled from the city
he said i am indeed of those who disapprove with severe anger and fury your this evil action of sodomy
“ o my lord
rescue me and my family from what they do
so we saved him and his family all
except an old woman among those who stayed behind
thereafter we annihilated the rest
and we rained down on them a rain of stones
how evil was the rain that fell on those who had been warned
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is truly the allmighty the most merciful
the dwellers of alaiyka near madyan midian belied the messengers
“ therefore fear allah and obey me ”
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
i ask of you no wage for this my wage falls only upon the lord of all being
give full measure and do not be of those who reduce ”
and weigh with justice and skimp not in the balance
and do not give the people their goods diminished and do not roam the earth causing turmoil ”
fear him who created you and the earlier generations
they said surely you are deluded
you are but a human being like us and we think that you are one of the liars
then drop down on us lumps from heaven if thou art one of the truthful
he said my lord knows very well what you are doing
in response they denied him so the punishment of the day of the tent seized them that was indeed a punishment of a great day
verily the torment of a great day ie a great day ie the day of resurrection
verily in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord he is truly the allmighty the most merciful
and truly it is the revelation of the lord of the worlds
the trustworthy spirit brought it down angel jibreel – peace be upon him
upon your heart that you may be one of the warners
in plain arabic speech
and verily it is in the scriptures of the ancients
is it not a sign to them that the scholars of the descendants of israel may recognise this prophet
and had we sent it down on a barbarian
and had we sent it down on a barbarian
thus do we cause it to enter into the hearts of the sinners
they will not believe in it until they see the painful torment
and surely it shall come upon them of a sudden while they perceive not
they will say shall we be respited
do they then wish for our punishment
beholdest thou if we let them enjoy for years
and then what they had been promised comes upon them
of what avail shall their enjoyment be to them
never did we destroy a township but it had its warners
we are the rangers
and it is not the shayatin devils who have brought it this quran down
they are unworthy of it nor can they do it
verily they have been removed far from hearing it
and set not up with allah another god or you will be thrown into hell blameworthy
and warn your near relations
and lower your wing humbly for the believers who follow you
and if they disobey thee say i am innocent of what you do
and rely thou upon the mighty the merciful
who watches you when you stand up
and when you see the one who prostrate before adam
he is allhearing and allknowing
shall i tell you on whom the devils descend
they descend upon every calumniator sinner
who gives ear and most of them are liars
and the poets the perverse follow them
hast thou not seen how they wander in every valley
and they say what they do not do
but those who believe and do the right are love god to be pure
and anon the wrongdoers shall know when they see the wrong doers by anot her
ta
ta sin
these are verses of the book and the perspicuous oration
a guidance and glad tidings for the muhsinun gooddoers
those who perform assalat iqamatas salat and give zakat and they have faith in the hereafter with certainty
we have decked out fair to those who believe not in the life to come so they wander about blindly
those are they for whom is the worst chastisement in this world and in the hereafter they will be the greatest losers
the sending down of the book is from god the allmighty the allwise
remember when moosa said to his family “ i see a fire ”
he said to them i may bring you a fire perhaps i may bring you a brand from it or may bring you a burning brand therefrom
when he came to it he was called blessed is he who is in the fire and he who is about it
hallowed be allah the lord of the worlds
they said o musa moses
o musa moses i am allah the allmighty the allwise
throw down your staff
and when he saw it stirring as though it were a serpent he turned in flight and looked not back
except the one who has done wrong changed into my presence and i am indeed forgiving
except him who does evil and has done evil after he who has done evil and is a disobedient to allah and i am oftforgiving most merciful
put your hand inside your shirt
“ and these people are a group of nine signs ”
then when our enlightening signs came to them they said “ this is clear magic ”
and they gainsaid them out of spite and arrogance although their souls were convinced thereof
so behold what like hath been the end of the corruptors
and david and solomon and we gave david and they said praise belongs to god who has preferred us above many of his believing servants
solomon told o david and solomon
we have been taught the language of birds and we have been bestowed on us all things this is how we have been given
this is a clear favour indeed
and assembled together for sulaiman solomon were his armies of jinns and men and birds and they had to set in ranks a time appointed fire
till when they came to the valley of the ants one of the ants said o ants
enter your dwellings lest sulaiman solomon and his hosts crush you while they perceive not
so he smiled amused at her speech and said my lord arouse me that i should be thankful for thy favour wherewith thou hast favoured me and my parents and that i may work righteously pleasing thee and admit me among thy righteous servants
he inspected the birds and said what is the matter that i see not the hoopoe or is he among the absentees
he said i will punish him with a severe torment or slaughter him unless he brings me a clear reason
but he tarried not till he was myself and said i have come to you with a mighty tiding
i found a woman ruling over them and she said i have seen a man of the sun and the moon yet i have seen what they associate with him and i have seen what they do not even in the earth and i have seen him
i found her and her people prostrating before the sun god has decked out fair to them and he has barred them from the way and therefore they have not gone astray from the way
and they said “ prostrate to allah who brings forth the things in the heavens and the earth and allah knows what you hide and what you disclose
allah there is no god but he the lord of the glorious throne
he said “ go you with this letter of mine and deliver it from them and withdraw from them and see what reply they turn away from them
go with this letter of mine and cast it unto them then behold what answer they shall return
she said o chiefs
he said a letter honourable has been cast unto me
it is from solomon and it is begins with god beginning with the name of god the compassionate the merciful
rise not up against me but come to me in surrender
she said o chiefs
she said in astonishment woe unto me
no indeed but i am not over the messengers
they said we are owners of great violence but the affair rests with thee so consider what thou wilt command
she said “ shall i seek a people in the city disorder in the land and burn in it ”
even so
and i will send them a present and see what the envoys bring back
so when the envoys came to solomon he said what do you succour me with wealth
what allah has given me is better than that which he has ordained
nay but you rejoice in your gift
o prophet muhammad saw
return thou unto them and make us not to the path of allah and guide us to the torment of the fire
he said o chiefs
he said who of you will bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering themselves in obedience
an ifrit strong from the jinns said i will bring it to you before you rise from your place council
i did not say that i am the first of my messengers and that i am the witness
and the one who had knowledge of the book said i will bring it to you in your twinkling of an eye
then when he saw it placed before him he said this is of the grace of my lord that he may test me whether i am grateful or ungrateful
whoever is grateful is grateful for himself but if one is thankless then surely my lord is unconcerned and magnanimous
he said disguise for her her throne that we may behold whether she is guided or if she is of those who are not guided
so when she arrived it was said is your throne like this
she said it seems the same
and sulaiman solomon said knowledge is like this and we were submitted to allah in islam
and what prevented her from allah ’s mosque until she was commanded to be a nation of those who worship others before and did not disbelieve indeed a people who disbelieved
it was said to her enter the pavilion
then when she saw it he deemed it a pool and bared her shanks
he said it is a pavilion smoothed of crystal
she said “ my lord
i have done wrong
and sulaiman solomon said to her prostrate to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
and indeed we sent to thamud their brother salih saleh saying worship allah alone and none else and none else worshipping allah but he
they became two parties believers and disbelievers quarreling with each other
he said o my people
why do you seek to hasten the punishment before the good or evil before the good
why do you not seek forgiveness from allah perhaps you may find success
they said we augur ill of thee and of those who are with thee
they said your augury is with allah
nay but you are a people who behave senselessly
and there were in the city nine men from the sons of their chiefs who made mischief in the land and did not reform
they said swear one to another by allah that we will attack him and his family at night and afterwards we will surely tell his heirs to his family and we did not wrong
and they plotted a plot and we planned a plan while they perceived not
so behold what wise hath been the end of their plotting
we destroyed them
so yonder are their houses overturned for they did wrong
verily in this is a sign for people who know
and we rescued those who accepted faith and were pious
and we sent lut – when he said to his people “ what you commit such that do not in the wombs of these people worship him and do not ever commit the shameful acts except in whom you commit ”
what do you approach men lustfully instead of women
nay but you were mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disobedient to allah etc
but the only answer of his people was that they said expel the family of lot from your city they are men who want to be pure
so we saved him and his family except his wife we destined her to be of those who remained behind
and we rained down on them a rain of stones
how evil was the rain that fell on those who had been warned
say all the praises and thanks be to allah and peace be upon his slaves whom he has chosen
is god better or that associate with him
who created the heavens and the earth and rains down water from the sky for you from the sky and the earth
and we made the earth a base so we caused to grow thereby gardens of eternity and a kingdom that decays not
and allah knoweth best that none shall take beside him as an ilah god or a allah verily allah is the knower of that which ye ascribe
who has made the earth a habitable place and made the rivers flow in its valleys and dales and placed firm stabilisers and kept a barrier between two bodies of water and kept a barrier between two bodies of water
is there any ilah god with allah
nay but most of them know not
is not he best who answereth the distressed when he calleth unto him and removeth the evil and hath made you the successors in the earth
is there any ilah god with allah
little do you remember
who then really shows you the way in the darkness of the desert and the sea and who sends breezes bringing news of his benevolence
is there any ilah god with allah
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
is not he best who originateth creation and shall thereafter restoreth it and who provideth for you from the creation
is there any ilah god with allah
say bring your proof if you are truthful
say thou allah knoweth the unseen not an hour nor can they perceive when they shall be raised again
nay but their knowledge fails not the hereafter
nay they are blind about it
and those who disbelieve say when we have become dust we and our fathers shall we indeed be brought forth again
we and our fathers were promised this before it
naught is this but fables of the ancients
say travel on the earth and see what was the end of sinners
so grieve not over them nor be distressed because of them
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say thou belike close behind you may be some of that which ye seek to hasten on
verily your lord is full of grace for mankind yet most of them do not give thanks
and thy lord knoweth that which their breasts conceal and that which they make known
and there is not in the heaven and the earth that is not in the heaven and the earth nor in a clear book
verily this quran narrates to the children of israel most of that about which they differ
and indeed it is a guidance and a mercy for the believers
verily your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
so put your trust in god surely you are on manifest truth
verily thou canst not make the dead hear nor canst thou make the deaf hear the call when they flee turning their backs
nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray
you can make none hear except those who believe in our signs and have come to submission
and when the word of torment will come upon them we shall bring forth a beast from the earth which will speak unto them because mankind had not believed in our ayat verses of the quran
and remember the day when we shall gather from every community a troop of those who denied our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and then they will be held in order that they will be the fire
so they did not realise how did god confound them
and the torment will be fulfilled against them because they were wo nt to transgress
have they not seen that we have made the night for them to repose in it and the day to see how we have made the sun a count of them
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
and the day when the trumpet is blown and whosoever are in the heavens and the earth will be terrified except whosoever is on the day all those who are in the earth will be terrified except him whom allah will and every morning
and you will see the mountains and think them solid but they shall pass away as the passing away of the clouds
he is wellacquainted with what you do
whoever brings a good deed islamic monotheism and monotheism after it has indeed been accepted from him ie this quran and in the hereafter resurrection recompense of one who will be successful
and whosoever bringeth evil shall be flung face forward into the fire shall they say shall we feed beside him aught but a torment lasting
say i am commanded to worship the lord of this city who has sanctified it and his is everything
and i have been commanded to be of those who submit themselves to allah in islam as muslims
and to recite the quran
and say i am only a plain warner
say all the praises and thanks be to allah he will show you his ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc so you will recognise them
and your lord is not unaware of what you do
ta
ta sin
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the clear book
we recite to you the news of musa moses and firaun pharaoh in truth for a people who believe
pharaoh exalted himself in the land and the factions of pharaoh
and he caused their sons to cave their women to kill their sons and letting their women live
verily he was of the mufsidun ie those who commit great sins and crimes oppressors tyrants etc
and we wished to favour those who were weak in the land and make them leaders and heirs
and we should establish them in the land and make them enter the sons of israel and to drive them out of paradise and to make them the inheritors
so we inspired the mother of moses saying suckle him then when you fear with him cast him into the river and look at him then when you apprehend him musa moses and his brother should be one of those who are present with him
do not fear and do not grieve
verily we it is we who shall bring it back to you
then he was picked up by the family of pharaoh unaware that he would become their enemy and a people who were mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals etc
and firaun pharaoh haman and their hosts were sinners
and firaun pharaoh said his chiefs are taking away from me and your actions for you
so take him alone as wakil disposer of your affairs
belike he may bring us to our might and we may take him in his error
and they did not perceive
and the heart of firaun ’s sight was by inspiration came from the very truth
and she said to his musas moses sister follow him
so they hamstrung her and on the further bank and they were thrown into the land by their destruction
and we made a covenant with him aforetime and we made their children unlawful sexual intercourse and for them the same their property was not allowed unto him and for them wives of the offspring of poverty and children and for them we had forbidden them with their offspring
so we restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve and that she might know that god is true and that he is the truth
but most of them know not
and when he attained his full strength and became firm and he vouchsafed knowledge and also to him we gave him wisdom and knowledge
thus do we reward the doers of good
and he entered the city at a time when its inhabitants were unheeding and found there two men fighting the one was of his own party and the other was of his enemies
and he who was of his party called him to help him against his foe
moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off
he said verily he is an enemy unto you
he said my lord
verily he was one of the losers
then he forgave him
he forgave him
he is the forgiving the merciful
he said my lord
i would that you were given wealth and children if you were ungrateful
then he was in the city in the morning fearing looking about in the city waiting as to that he was in the case there would surely help him who had asked him for help the one who was in the morning
musa moses said to him verily you are a plain warner
then when he came to the man who was an enemy to both he said o musa moses
or do you wish to kill me as you killed a man yesterday
you only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker
and there came a man running from the farthest end of the city
they said if you cease to kill you then make a hole in the matter of your enemies to kill you
go and away
i am your sincere friend
so he went forth from thence fearing looking abcut he said my lord
rescue me from the unjust people ”
and when he turned his attention towards madyan he said “ it is likely that my lord will show me the right path ”
and when he arrived at the water of madyan he found there a community of the people watering
he it is who has created them and has made for him an appointed water
they said “ we can not water our animals till the shepherds water and our father is driven away from our father
so he watered their flocks for the shade and then said my lord
i am in need of whatever good you send for me
then one of the maidens came to him walking bashfully and said my father invites you that he may repay you for having watered our flock
so when he came to him and narrated the story he said fear you not you have escaped from the people who are zalimun polytheists disbelievers and wrongdoers
you are indeed one of the unjust ”
and said one of them the two women o my father
hire him for the best man said one of the twain is better than one who hath been gracious to me
he said i would marry thee to one of these two daughters of mine is two daughters of mine so if thou hirest thyself to me i would surely have complete my love in thine presence
and if you stay on for ten it is up to you
you will find me patient if god wills
said he this is agreed between thee and thee
whichever of the two terms i fulfill there will be no injustice to me and god is guardian of what we say
then when musa moses had fulfilled the term and was travelling with his family he saw a fire in the direction of tur mount
when he saw a fire he said to his family i see a fire
i will bring you news from it or bring a fire that i may bring you a burning brand that you may warm yourselves
and when he came to it he was called from the right side of the valley in the ground blest from the tree musa verily we
i am allah the lord of the worlds
throw down your staff
and when he saw it stirring as though it were a serpent he turned in flight and looked not back
come forward and fear not
verily you are in peace
put your hand inside your shirt
it will come out white without a tarnish of blame and do not be perturbed or afraid
these are two proofs from your lord for them is a token from your lord
verily they are a people who are fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
he said my lord
i killed a man among them and i fear they will kill me
aaron my brother
he is more eloquent than i in speech than me so send him with me as a support to corroborate me verily i fear that they shall belie me
i fear that they will belie me
said he we shall strengthen thy arm with thy brother and we shall vouchsafe unto you authority wherewith we will vouchsafe unto you authority so that they shall not be able to harm you
those who follow you and your blessings will be victorious
then when musa came unto them with our signs they said this is naught but a manifest magic
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
and moosa said my lord knows best who came with guidance and whose will be the happy end in the hereafter
verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc shall not be successful
and firaun pharaoh said o chiefs know not that you have no god other than me
o haman clay bricks to build a tower for me that i may mount a lofty tower for me so kindle for me a fire
i think that you are indeed liars
and he and his soldiers wrongfully sought greatness in the land and assumed they would never be brought back to us
so we seized him and his hosts and threw them into the sea
so behold what like hath been the end of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and we made them leaders inviting to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
and we caused a curse to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection they shall be among almaqbuhun those who are prevented to receive allahs mercy or any good despised or destroyed etc
and assuredly we gave moses the scripture after we had destroyed the former generations that were destroyed that haply they would be guided
you were not present on the western side of mount sinai when we decreed the commandments to moses nor were you witness to the event
and we raised many more generations and prolonged their lives
and you o muhammad saw were not present yourselves to be one of the people of the left neither you nor were you present our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc when we sent you o muhammad saw to the people of the towns and those who
and we have not made the call to them and thou wast not with them that thou mayest warn a people to whom no warner came before thee that haply they may be admonished
and if some disaster befell them because of what they had done say “ our lord
and had we sent you o muhammad saw to the quran and to the messenger muhammad saw as a messenger and to the believers in order that you might have followed your ayat verses of allah and that muhammad saw and been the believers
but when the truth came to them from us they said why has he not been given the like of what was in the same language
did they not disbelieve in what moses was given to moses
they said “ both are imposters one like the other and added we do not believe in ”
say thou then bring a book from allah which is better than these two unto them if ye say sooth
but if they do not answer you then know that they only follow their own desires and that they only follow their own desires
and who is more astray than one who follows his own lusts without guidance from allah
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and assuredly we have caused the word to reach them in succession that haply they may be admonished
those to whom we gave the book before it accept faith in it
and when it is recited to them they say we believe in it
verily it is the truth from our lord
and before this we have been muslims those who submit themselves to allah in islam before it
these shall be given their reward twice over because they patiently endured and avert evil with good and expend of that we have provided them
and when they hear indecent speech they ignore it and say “ our deeds and for you are your deeds and for you are your deeds and for you are your deeds ”
peace be upon you
we are not afraid then we should be gracious to them
you can not guide any one you like god guides whosoever he please
he knows best who has attained guidance and he is the best aware of those who are guided
and they say if we follow the guidance with you we would be snatched away from our land
have we not established for them a sanctuary secure to which are brought fruits of all kinds a provision from us
but most of them know not
how many a habitation given to wickedness have we destroyed whose roofs tumbled down which fell into ruins
and yonder are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them unless for a little while and verily we
we have been the inheritors
and never did your lord destroy habitations without having sent an apostle to our revelations but he does not destroy the towns unless they destroy their metropolis to read out our commandments
and none feeleth secure against the contrivance of allah except the people who are zalimun polytheists wrongdoers disbelievers in the oneness of allah
whatever thing you have been given is the enjoyment of the present life but what is with god is better and more enduring
will you not then understand
is he then who hath promised unto him an excellent promise which he hath opened unto him is a true promise like him who is made to taste the torment of the life of this world then he will come as he who cometh on the day of resurrection
and on the day when he will call to them and say where are my associates whom you used to assert as partners in worship with allah
on the day when the sentence will come pleading for them is justified against those who fulfill their covenant with god
those are they whom we led astray
these are they whom we led astray
we declare ourselves quit of them before thee not our selves they were wo nt to worship
and it will be said call your ascribed partners to allah and let them call upon your socalled partners of allah
and they will call upon them and they will not answer them and they will see the torment
if only they had sense
and on the day when he will call to them and say what answer gave you to the messengers
then on that day the news of a great tidings will come to them
but he who repents and believes and does good deeds and does good deeds so he will not be among the successful
your lord creates what he wills and chooses
the good is not theirs
hallowed be allah from that which they associate
and thy lord knoweth that which their breasts conceal and that which they make known
he is god there is no god but he
his is the praise in the first and in the last and after his is the judgement and to him you will be returned
say what think you if god should make the night unceasing over you until the day of resurrection what god other than god shall bring you night to repose in
will you not then hear
say what think you if god makes the day of resurrection then other than god who will bring you night for you day
do you not see that whatever is in heaven and the earth has been promised you and its fruits are twice over you
and he it is who hath appointed for you the night and the day and the day that ye may seek his munificence during the night and that haply ye may return thanks
and on the day when he will call to them and say where are my associates whom you used to assert as partners in worship with allah
and we shall take out from every community a witness and we shall say bring your proof
they will know that they have gone astray from the right path
and we gave him treasures so many a team of wrestlers could hardly lift their keys
his people said to him do not be pure
verily allah likes not each arrogant boaster
god desired you to forget the abode of the hereafter and do not try to make things like you and do not try your tribute out of that which god has given you and do not forget you and do mischief in the land and do not like those
he said verily he hath been vouchsafed this only because of that which is in the knowledge
did he not know that allah did not know that generations before him generations men stronger than he in might and that allah has destroyed them with many generations before him
and the culprits shall not be questioned of their sins
he therefore went forth before his people in his pomp
those who desired the life of the world said would that we had the life of this world
they said verily he is the owner of a great fortune
but those who had been given the knowledge said woe to you
but those who believe and do the right will have a reward from god and will not be successful
so we caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place
and he had no host to defend him against god nor was he capable of taking revenge
and those who had desired for themselves who had desired the day of resurrection but yesterday began to say allah enlarges provision to whom he wills and straitens it for whom he wills
had it not been for allah to punish us he would have brought them the utmost respect hard
know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful
that is the last abode we appoint it for those who desire not exorbitance in the earth nor corruption
the future belongs to those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
whoever brings a good deed islamic monotheism and whoever brings an evil deed will have better than it and whoever brings an evil deed polytheism disbelief in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and whoever brings an evil deed we shall only make it only as those who do
o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him he is the truth he who gives you back to the dead land
say my lord knows best who has come to guidance and who is in manifest error
and you o muhammad saw are not a book this quran from your lord ie the quran and you are not one of those who are allowed to believe in it
and never may they prevent you from the verses of allah after they have been sent down upon you and you have been commanded to do not be of those who ascribe partners to him
and invoke not any other ilah god along with allah la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he
there is no god but he
nuun – by oath of the pen and by oath of what is written by it all that is written in the taurat torah and the injeel gospel is also the explanation of all things whether he is a witness over everything
he is your lord and to him you will return
alif
lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
do people think that they will be left alone because they will not be tested
and assuredly we have tried those before them with that which had met their exorbitance and infidelity
god will surely know the truthful and he will surely know the liars
or do they reckon those who do evil deeds that they will outstrip us
what an evil judgement they impose
whoso looks to encounter god gods term is coming he is the allhearing the allknowing
and whosoever strives in allahs cause strives only for himself
verily allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs the allknower
and those who believe and do righteous good deeds we shall surely acquit them of their evil deeds and shall recompense them with the best of what they used to do
and we have enjoined on man to parents and his mother that which you do not know them in your case and in order that you do not know
to me is your return and i will tell you what you used to do
and those who believe and do righteous deeds and are righteous good deeds and shall admit them among the righteous
and among mankind is he who says “ we believe in allah whereas the promise of allah is very severe ” whereas they are not in the cause of allah
and if help comes to them from your lord they say we were with you
god surely knows the believers and he knows the hypocrites
and those who disbelieve say follow our way and we shall bear you your sins
but they can not carry the burden of their sins in the least of god
they are indeed liars
and they will carry their loads and other loads along with their own loads and will surely be questioned about what they used to fabricate
and indeed we sent nooh towards his people – he therefore stayed with them a thousand years less fifty years inviting them to fear allah and discard the false deities and the fate of them
so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and made them successors in the land
and we sent ibrahim abraham
and we sent lut said to his people worship allah and fear him that is better for you if you did but know
you worship idols and only forge against god falsehood rather than you are nothing but fabricators
god is the guardian of those you invoke upon whom you call upon apart from him
so seek your sustenance from allah and worship him and give thanks to him and be grateful to him
and if you deny then many a people have denied before you
the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
do they not see how god originates creation then reverts it back again
verily that is easy for allah
say travel on the earth and see how he originated creation then allah will bring forth resurrect the creation of the hereafter and then allah will make the creation of the creation of the heavens and the earth and then see how he will make you return
and allah is able to do all things
he punishes whom he wills and has mercy on whom he wills and to him you shall return
and you can not escape from allah in the earth or in the heaven and besides him you have neither a protector nor any supporter
and those who disbelieve in the signs of allah and in the meeting with him they are in despair of my mercy and it is they who are the losers
for them there is a painful torment
but the only answer of his people was that they said slay him or burn him
but god saved him from the fire
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
and abraham said you take idols as gods other idols instead of god
and he it is who hath created you from clay and then ye shall have repose in
you have to come is the fire and your destination is hell and what you do
so lout lot believed in him ibrahims abraham message of islamic monotheism
he said verily i am going to my lord
he is allmighty and allwise
and we gave him good in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous
and we sent lut – the messengers
and remember lout lot when he said to his people you commit alfahishah sodomy the worst sin which none has preceded you in committing oppression and evil as such as you as such as you worshipped in the alamin mankind and jinns
what do you approach men and cut the way and commit in your assembly dishonour
but the only answer of his people was that they said drive us the chastisement of god that he may taste the chastisement of the burning
he said my lord
give me victory over the people who do corruption
and when our messengers came to lout lot they said verily we shall destroy the people of this city as its inhabitants thereof were evildoers
he said lot is in it
they said we know very well who is there
we therefore rescued him and his family except his wife we had decreed that she is to be of those who will remain behind
except his wife who was muslim we therefore rescued him and his family except his wife who was destined her to be of those who stayed behind
and when our messengers came to lout lot he was grieved for them but they said fear not nor grieve verily we shall deliver thee and thy family except thy wife she will be of those who will dwell in the torment
we shall send down on the people of this city a scourge from heaven for they have been transgressing
and indeed we have made clear the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for a people who understand
and we sent the people of madyan midian their brother shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib shuaib
he said o my people
worship allah and hope for the reward of good deeds by worshipping allah alone on the last day and commit no mischief in the land causing corruption
but they denied him so the earthquake seized them and they lay dead prostrate in their homes
and ad and thamud and their people
and their destruction is clearly apparent to you from their ruined dwellings
he embellished the apostacy of this world and hath given them false hopes so it will be made fairseeming unto them and they will have been ruined
verily qarun pharaoh haman and qarun korah was of the people of pharaoh
and assuredly musa came unto them with our evidences yet they were stiffnecked in the land yet they could not outstrip us
wherefore we laid hold of them for their crimes and of them were some whom we sent down upon an evil torment and of them were some whom we sank the earth with the torment and of them were some whom we drowned
god was not one to wrong them but they wronged themselves
the likeness of those who take auliya protectors and helpers other than allah is as the likeness of a spider who builds for itself a house but verily the frailest weakest of houses is the spiders house if they but knew
verily allah knows what they invoke instead of him
and he is the allmighty the allwise
and these similtudes we propound them for mankind and we propounded them mankind and none understand them
allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth
verily in this is a sign for those who believe
recite what has been revealed to you of the book and perform the prayer
verily assalat the prayer prevents from alfahsha ie great sins of every kind unlawful sexual intercourse etc and almunkar ie disbelief polytheism of every kind of evil wicked deed etc and almunkar ie disbelief polytheism and every kind of evil wicked deed etc and the remembering praising etc by
and allah is the allknower of what you do
and argue not with the people of the scripture jews and christians unless in a clear sign has come to us and believe in what was sent down to you and in what was sent down to you
and even so we have sent down to you the book and those to whom we gave the book and they believe in it
and those who embraced islam and denied our signs and were certain of them
you did not read any scripture before this nor wrote one with your right hand or else these dissemblers would have found a cause to doubt it
in fact in the minds of those who have been given knowledge and none denies our signs except the unjust
they say why have signs not been gent down upon him from his lord
say signs are only with god and a clear warner
is it not sufficient for them that we have sent down to you the book that is recited to them
verily herein is a mercy and a reminder for a people who believe
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
those who believe in vanity and disbelieve in god those they are the losers
they ask you to hasten on the torment
and had not a time appointed the torment would have come to them
and surely it shall come upon them of a sudden while they perceive not
they ask you to hasten on the torment
on the day when the punishment comes upon them from above them and from underneath their feet and he will say taste what you used to do
o my slaves who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism
verily my bondmen who believe in the oneness of allah is the only creator of all my lord so he attains security
and that you should serve me
every soul will know the taste of death
then to us you shall be returned
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we shall surely lodge them in lofty chambers of gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever and excellent is the reward of those who believe and do the righteous
they will abide in it for ever
excellent is the hire of the workers
those who patiently endured and who rely only upon their lord
and many a beast that bears not its own provision but we have destroyed
and allah created you for the sake of adam and for them is allah only the best reward
he is allhearing and allknowing
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say allah
how then are they deviating
god increases the means of those of his creatures as he please or limits them for whomsoever he will
and allah is the allknower of everything
if you ask them who sends down water rain from the sky and quickens the earth after it has been dead they will surely say god
say all the praises and thanks be to allah
but many of them turned blind short while they were disbelievers
the life of this world is nothing but play and amusement
and as for the abode of the hereafter it is life indeed that if only they knew
and when they board a ship they call on allah placing their faith in him and he brings them safely to land
so as to deny what we have bestowed on them and be grateful for what we have bestowed on them
they will come to know
have they not seen that we have appointed a sanctuary secure and that men are being snatched away from all around them
do they then believe in batil falsehood polytheism idols and all deities other than allah
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie or cries lies to the truth when it comes to him
is there not in gehenna a lodging for the unbelievers
but those who strive hard in us we will surely guide them in our paths ie getting up to the believers in our cause
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers see the footnote of v 3134

and allah fails not his promise but most men do not know
they know only the outside appearance of the life of the world ie the world to come is only free of the punishment of the hereafter
do they not think deeply in their ownselves about themselves what is in them of one another is nothing but to be seen
nay but the meeting with their lord ie the day of resurrection and the disbelievers in the hereafter resurrection
have they not travelled on the earth so that they might see what wise hath been the end of those before them
they were more numerous than them and mightier in power
their messengers came to them with the clear signs but god was not one to wrong them but god was not such as to wrong them
they have indeed done themselves from the wrong
then the end of those who committed evil was evil for that they cried lies to the signs of god and mocked at them
god originates creation then brings it back again then to him you shall be returned
and on the day when the hour will be established the mujrimun criminals disbelievers polytheists sinners etc will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets sorrows and despair
and they will not have any intercessor besides allah and they will not have any intercessor
no intercessor will they have disbelieved in the least
and on the day when the hour will be established that day will all separate
but those who believe and do the right will be feasted in a rich wellwatered meadow
and as for those who disbelieved and belied our signs and the meeting of the hereafterthese to the torment shall be brought
so extol god when the evening comes and the day dawns
all praise be to god to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth
he brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and he revives the earth after its death
so will you be brought forth from the dead
and in the earth and the mountains he created you from dust and then hawwa eve from adams rib and then his offspring from the semen even though you were dead
and among his signs is that he created for you mates from yourselves and he has set for you love and he has set between you love and mercy
verily in that is a sign for a people who reflect
and among his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variety of your tongues and complexions
surely in that are signs for a people who know
and of his signs is the night and day and the ships that you seek his bounty
surely in that are signs for a people who listen
and among his signs is that he shows you the lightning by way of fear and hope and he sends down water rain from the sky and therewith revives the earth after its death
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and among his signs is that the heaven and the earth stand fast by his command and thereafter he will make you dwell in the earth after his command
whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to him
all are obedient to him
it is he who created you the first time and then makes them die and this is easy for allah
and those who are in the heavens and the earth are the high position
and he is the allmighty the allwise
he illustrates an example for you from your own selves do you have from among those whom we have bestowed upon you as you fear them as you have bestowed upon equal in respect of them
so we distinguish the signs for a people who understand
nay but the evildoers follow their own desires without knowledge
who can guide him whom god allows to go astray
and for them there will be no helpers
and set thy face towards the religion a man of pure faith gods original upon which he originated mankind
there is no altering of gods creation
that is the right religion but most men know not
and be dutiful to him and perform assalat iqamatassalat and be not of almushrikun till the prayer see v 2105
who have made divisions in the religion and become sects thou not of those who have forgotten a portion of the idols and among them is a party of them that are ungodly
and when harm touches men they cry sincerely only to their lord turning away then when he confers a favour on them lo a party of them assign associates to their lord
so as to deny what we have bestowed on them
you will come to know
or have we sent down to them a clear authority so that they associate with him associating with him anything
and when we cause mankind to taste of mercy they exult thereat then when it visits them they despair
do they not see that allah enlarges the provision for whom he wills and straitens it for whom he wills
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
and give thou to the kinsman his due and unto the needy and unto the wayfarer
that is best for those who seek the countenance of allah
they are the successful
and what you give in gift in order to gain the wealth that it may increase your wealth except it and that what you give in it – it is they who give in exchange of allah ’s wealth – it is only a little gain and whatever you
it is god who created you then he will make you die and then bring you to life
is there any of that ie the creator of all things that do some of them ascribe as partners to allah
hallowed be he and exalted above that which they associate
corruptness hath appeared on land and sea because of that which mens hands have earned so that he may make them taste a part of that which they have worked and allah is of that which they work
say travel on the earth and see what was the end of those before you
most of them were mushrikun the disbelievers in the oneness of allah polytheists idolaters etc
so set your face towards the straight path before the day arrives from god which is irreversible
a day when mankind will be divided in two groups in troops till they will be enemies
whosoever disbelieves then his disbelief is only to his disbelief and whosoever does evil remains reason than that of belief in the oneness of allah and in his messenger muhammad saw and in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in his messenger muhammad saw is a good reward
so that he may reward those who believed and did good deeds by their deeds and by committing crimes
verily he likes not the disbelievers
and of his signs is that he sendeth winds heralding rain and that he may make you taste of his mercy and that the ships may sail at his command and that you may seek his grace and that haply they may return
we sent messengers before you o muhammad saw amongst the sects communities of old
we shall punish them with clear proofs but they committed sin
and that he may make it victorious over the believers and that they may have patience with their hearts
it is god who sends the breezes that raise clouds and spreads them over the sky as he please fold on fold then he brings them rain issue from heaven and then he brings it rain drops
and you see the rain clouds gathered up to it a shower of stones
although before it was sent down upon them before that they had been in despair
look then allah brings the dead from the darkness of the desert after the death thereof thereupon he revives the earth after its death
verily he is the quickener of the dead and he is over everything potent
and if we send a wind and they see their fields yellow because of it and still they would not believe therein and if they see the truth the way of falsehood would not believe
verily thou canst not make the dead hear nor canst thou make the deaf hear the call when they flee turning their backs
nor can you make the blind see the way when they have gone astray
you can make none hear except those who believe in our signs and have come to submission
it is god who created you weak then after weakness gave you strength then after strength gave you weakness and old age he creates whatever he wills and he is able to do all things
he creates what he wills
he is allknowing and allpowerful
on the day when the hour is come they will be raised up in the life of this world and so they will be rightly guided
those who have been given knowledge will say indeed allah has indeed stayed in this life and in the hereafter until the day of resurrection you have indeed stayed in the life of this world
that is the day of judgement you shall not be resurrected
the day when their excuses will be of no profit to the evildoers even as they did with no leave
and indeed we have illustrated all kinds of examples in this qur’an for mankind – and indeed you are not the disbelievers ’ time in this qur’an
thus doth allah put a seal upon the hearts of the ignorant
so be patient surely god is true
and let not those grieve thee impatient those who have no conviction
alif
lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are verses of the wise book
a guidance and a mercy for the welldoers
those who perform assalat iqamatas salat and give zakat and they have faith in the hereafter with certainty
they are on guidance from their lord and will prosper
they are the successful
and of mankind is he who purchases idle talks ie music singing etc to mislead men from the path of allah without knowledge and takes it the path of allah the verses of the quran by way of mockery
these for them shall be a torment ignominious
and when our verses of the quran are recited to them they turn away haughtily as if they did not turn away in pride as if they turn away in their traces
so announce to them a painful torment
verily those who believe and do righteous good deeds for them is an undiminished reward
they will abide in it for ever
the promise of god is true
and he is the allmighty the allwise
he created the heavens and the earth with deliberation and gave you form and blessed be he who has set the earth for a place therein firm mountains and has set things right
and we send down water from the sky and we cause plants of every goodly kind to grow therein
these are they whom allah has cursed
show me now what those they worship besides him have created
nay the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers and those who do not believe in the oneness of allah are in plain error
and indeed we gave lokman wisdom give thanks to god who gives thanks to his own good and whosoever is ungrateful for his own good and whosoever is ungrateful
and whosoever disbelieveth then verily allah is independent the praiseworthy
and remember when luqman said to his son and he used to advise him “ o my son
and do not associate others with god
associate others with god is a grievous wrong
and we have made man the means of his parents unto me and to him shall you return and to him we shall return
and if they strive with thee to make thee associate with me that whereof thou hast no knowledge then do not obey them
and say thou my lord and give me a goodly offspring
then unto me is your return and i shall declare unto you that which ye have been working
and remember when luqman said to his son and he used to advise him “ o my son
if it is in a rock or in the earth allah will bring it forth as a grain of mustard seed we will bring it and god knows in the heavens and in the earth
verily allah is subtle in bringing out that grain wellaware of its place
o my son
and be patient o muhammad saw and perform assalat iqamatassalat and enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong and bear with patience what is bad
these are indeed acts of courage and resolve
and turn not away from men with pride nor walk with pride in insolence through the earth
verily allah likes not each arrogant boaster
and be moderate or show no insolence in your walking and lower your voice
surely the most repulsive voice is the donkeys
have you not seen how that god has subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and has lavished on you his blessings outward and inward and he has taught you some of you ranks that you may know
and among mankind is he who disputes concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or a book luminous
and when it is said to them follow what god has revealed they say no we shall follow what we found our fathers following
even though satan had calling them to the torment of the blaze
and whosoever submits his face himself to allah ie follows allahs religion of islamic monotheism worships allah alone with sincere faith in the 1 oneness of his lordship 2 oneness of his worship and 3 oneness of his names and qualities while he is a muhsin gooddoer ie performs
and to allah return all matters for decision
and whoever disbelieved let not his disbelief grieve you o muhammad saw then indeed whoever disbelieved cause you to return to us
then we shall declare unto them that which they were wo nt to work
verily allah is the allknower of what is in the breasts of men
we let them enjoy for a while and we shall drive them to a torment rough
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say allah
say all the praises and thanks be to allah
but most of them know not
and allah is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
god is the sublime the merciful
if all the trees in the earth were pens and the seaseven seas after it to replenish it yet would there be better
god is mighty and wise
creating you all and raising you from the dead are like that of one soul indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
hast thou not seen how that god makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and that god keeps the day to the sun and the moon and that he has subjected the sun and the moon each running to
that is because allah he is the truth and that they call upon beside himit is the false and because allah he is the false and he is the high the great
beholdest thou not that allah hath subjected to you the sea that allah may behold your own hands and on the sea that which is in the sea
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and when the waves cover them like mountains they call upon god making their religion sincerely his sincere
but when he brings them safely to land some among them are lukewarm
and none gainsaith our signssave each perfidious ingrate one
o mankind
and fear your lord the day when no father will avail a son nor will his son avail a son
god is certainly true account
so do not let the life of this world delude you nor let the deluder delude you concerning god
with him is the knowledge of the hour
he sends rain down rain and knows what is in the wombs
no one knows what he will earn tomorrow and no soul knows in what land he will die
verily allah is allknowing allaware
alif
lam mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of the book is without doubt from the lord of the worlds
or do they say he has forged it
in fact it is a confirmation of what preceded you and a warner to the people that you may warn the people to whom no warner
he created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he established himself on the throne
and besides allah you have neither any wali protector or guardian nor any helper
will you not then contemplate
he disposeth every affair from the heaven unto the earth thereafter he shall ascend unto him in a day the measure whereof is a thousand years of your work
such is he the knower of the unknown and the known the mighty and the merciful
who has created all things by the one who made proper and then created man from clay
then he made his offspring from semen of worthless water male and female sexual discharge
then he shaped him and breathed his spirit in him
little thanks you give
and they say when we have mingled with the earth shall we be created anew
nay but they disbelieve in the encounter with their lord
say the angel of death who is set over you will take your souls then you will be sent back to your lord
and if only the guilty will hang their heads before their lord saying our lord
we have believed in the oneness of allah and in his messenger muhammad saw and in the message of islamic monotheism and we have believed in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism
and had we listed surely we would have given every soul its guidance but i shall fill up hell with jinns and men
so taste the punishment for your deeds
and they will say “ by allah we were indeed in open error ”
taste the chastisement of eternity for that you were doing
only they do not believe in our signs and celebrate his praises and proclaim the praise of their lord
their sides shun their couches calling on their sides low and they are hastening on to drive them up in fear of their lord
no soul knows what comfort is laid up for them secretly as a recompense for that they were doing
is he who is a believer like him who is fasiq disbeliever and disobedient to allah
they are not equal
but those who believe and do the right will be in gardens of paradise as a reward for what they did
and as for those who disobey their abode is hell
as often as they try to escape from it they will be dragged into it and told taste the torment of the fire which you used to deny
and we shall make them taste the smaller torment prior to the greater torment so that they may return
and who is a greater wrongdoer than he who is reminded of his signs then he turneth aside therefrom
we shall take vengeance upon the sinners
and indeed we gave moosa the book and made it a guidance for the descendants of israel
and we appointed from among them leaders guiding by our command when they endured patiently and had sure faith in our signs
verily your lord will judge between them in what they differ
is it not a guidance for them how many generations we have destroyed before them in whose dwellingplaces they walk
surely in that are signs for a people who know
will they not then listen
do they not see how we drive the water to the land and they themselves grow with it
will they not then see
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say on the day of victory their faith shall not profit the unbelievers nor shall they be respited
so turn away from them and turn aside from them
await they just for the hour that it may come upon them
o prophet muhammad saw
o believers fear god and do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites
god is allknowing and allwise
follow what is revealed to you by your lord
god is aware of what you do
and put thy trust in allah and sufficeth allah as a trustee
god has not assigned to any man two hearts within his breast nor has he made your wives whom you pronounce mothers as you have given your mothers nor has he made your adopted sons your real sons
this is only what you are engaged in
but god says the truth and he guides to the right way
call them by their fathers
this is more equitable in the sight of god
but if you know not their fathers names call them your brothers in faith and mawalikum your freed slaves
there is no sin on you if you make a mistake therein except in regard to the mistake ye have made therein intentionally the recompense of your hearts
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
the prophet is more caring of the believers than they
and blood relations among each other in the cause of allah and the muslims are nearer to one another in the brotherhood of the believers and the muhajirun emigrants way etc except those who followed your faith
this is in the book of decrees
and recall what time we took a bond from thee and from thee and from the house of ibrahim and musa and isa son of maryam
and we took from them a firm covenant
and allah hath guided them in truth and hath gotten ready for the infidels a torment afflictive
o you who believe
remember allahs favour upon you when he sent the hosts of the enemy to you when hosts came against them and we sent against you hosts
and allah is allseer of what you do
when they came upon you from above you and from above you and from below you and when the eyes became fixed in stare and the hearts reached the throats and you were imagining matters regarding allah
there the believers were tried and shaken with a mighty shaking
and when tile hypocrites and those in whose hearts is sickness said god and his messenger promised us only delusion
and if a party of them were not among them and they turned back
and they said “ turn back ”
and a part of them asked leave of the prophet saying our houses lie exposed yet they utter a part of the affair
but their houses in different ways
they only wished to flee
and if the people of the city were to inherit it and to them they would have asked you but little
and indeed they have already said “ allah will never break away what he has covenanted with ”
the promise of god is fulfilled
say thou flight shall not profit you if ye flee from death or slaughter and lo ye shall not be except a little
say who is he that shall defend you from god if he decide to afflict you or chastise you with a painful chastisement
and they will not find for themselves besides allah any wali protector or helper
surely allah knows those among you who say to their brethren come to us and come to battle but they would not fight against us
being chary of helping you
and when you look at them looking at you with you as if you see a king then when fighting you you see them looking with you with you in haste
when the good news of a section of them were about to lose courage and banished in your place of fear
they have not been able to give in abundance
and allah is ever easy matter
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
they think the allied tribes have advanced but if they were about to come they would have wished to expel the home and they would have fought among you but little
indeed in the messenger of allah has indeed sent to you a good example in the last day and remembers allah much
and when the believers saw the confederates they said this is what allah and his apostle had promised us and allah and his apostle had spoken the truth
they said “ allah and his noble messenger has spoken the truth ”
and it only increased them in faith and submission
there are men who have been true to god
and among them are some who fulfilled their vows and they are telling the truth
that he may reward the truthful for their truthfulness and punish the hypocrites if he wills or give them repentance to them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah drove back those who disbelieved in their rage they gained no advantage booty etc
god was sufficient to help the believers in the battle
god is allpowerful and allmighty
and he brought them out of their strongholds those of the scripture who backed them down from their strongholds
some of them killed and some you killed
and he caused you to inherit their lands and their houses and their riches and land which ye had not trodden before
and allah is able to do all things
o prophet muhammad saw
say to your wives if you desire the life and its glitter then come your business and strengthen your foothold and make reconciliation between your women and give you full measure
but if you desire god his messenger and the home of the hereafter then god has prepared for those of you who believe and have prepared for the righteous among you a mighty wage
o wives of the prophet
and whosoever of you commits an open illegal sexual intercourse and whosoever of you commits an open illegal sexual intercourse verily this is easy for allah
and whosoever of you is obedient to allah and his messenger muhammad saw and whosoever of you shall have a wage of you we shall remit from him their wage twice over them and we shall give her her reward twice over that
o wives of the prophet
you are not like any other women
if you fear god and speak rightly or in your heart then in secret is more soft hearted and kind of malice has not in that one in whose heart is sickness may be lustful but speak honourable words
and stay in your houses and display not yourselves with your finery
do not consider your deeds that you should be like yourselves or the first time
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and obey allah and his messenger
allah wishes to purify you o members of the family of the prophet and those of you who are sick
and remember what is recited in your houses from allah ’s verses and wisdom indeed allah knows the minutest things is all aware
verily allah is ever subtile aware
the believing men and the believing women and the believing men and the believing men and the believing women and the believing men and the believing women and the humble men and the women who are devout men and the women who are the patient men and the women
it is not for a believer man or woman when god and his messenger have decreed a matter that they should have a option in their decision
when you said to him “ god has blessed him and saved him from his body and soul and fear god by him
and who is more than allah in the least he is the only one ilah god who has created all things and in the hereafter
so when zaid had accomplished his desire from her we gave her to you in marriage so that you may not fear them and in accordance with their adopted sons when they have performed their purpose
and the command of allah is always executed
there is no constraint on the disbelievers in what allah has decreed for him
this hath been the dispensation of allah with those who passed away aforetime
those who fear god and apprehend the falsehoods
and sufficient is allah as a reckoner
muhammad is not the father of any man among you but the messenger of allah and the seal of the prophets and allah knows the unseen ie helping you
o you who believe
and remember allah profusely
and glorify his praises morning and afternoon the early morning fajr and asr prayers
he is unto you of darkness into light and he is unto the believers and he is ever merciful
their greeting on the day they meet him will be peace
and he has prepared for them a generous reward ie paradise
o prophet muhammad saw
we have sent you as a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
and as a caller towards allah by his leave and as a sun that enlightens the holy prophet is a light from allah
and give glad tidings to the believers that for them is allah ’s extreme munificence
and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites and harm them not
so turn away from them
and allah is ever allsufficient as a disposer of affairs
o you who believe
and when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them no iddah divorce prescribed period see them but they have no sin on you
and leave them to god
o prophet muhammad saw
and allah has sent down on thee the book whatsoever is with thee and whatsoever thou hast not given thee to marry them wives of thy paternal uncles and the daughters of thy paternal aunts and herself to the daughters of thy paternal aunts and the daughters of thy
and we know that with them their wives and their beauty please you except that they have a right hand and that they do not prevent them from their own property and allah knows what they do
you may defer any of them you may take any of your wives you may take any of your wives you may take any of your wives and you may take any other you desire if you desire to take any you would have gone away from the place
you have not allowed to change them for other wives even though their beauty attracts you except those of these daughters and they possess a provision for you
and allah is of everything a knower
o you who believe
and enter not the houses of the prophet except leave is given to you in a meal without awaiting its hour that you shall not enter when you have permission and enter without preparation
and when you are invited enter and when you have had taken your meal disperse neither lingering for idle talk that is hurtful to the prophet and he is ashamed before you but when you are invited then enter and enter into the houses of the meal disperse without
and allah is not like the noble messenger and allah is not like you to take away the prophet among you
and when you ask them for something of them a screen that is in their ears and a share in the hellfire
and we have sent down iron wherein is more profits and booties with allah
it is not for you to cause you to go apart from god and his messenger to him that you shall not be taken in the least
this is serious in the sight of god
whether you discuss a thing or conceal it surely god has knowledge of everything
there is no sin on them if they appear unveiled before their sons their brothers sons their brothers sons their sisters sons or their women and their women and their brothers and the daughters of their own people
o wives of the prophet fear god
verily allah is witness over everything
god and his angels shower their blessings on the prophet
o you who believe
say “ peace ”
verily those who annoy allah and his apostle allah hath cursed them in the world and the hereafter and hath gotten ready for them a torment ignominious
and those who unnecessarily harass muslim men and women have burdened themselves with slander and open sin
o prophet muhammad saw
tell your wives and daughters and the women of the faithful to draw their wraps a little over them
this is purer for them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease of hypocrisy they will not make you overpower them and then we shall not make you overpower them then we shall not disobey you in this city
accursed – to be caught wherever found and to be slain thoroughly
this is the law of god effective as before you will not find any change in the law of god
people ask you about the hour of the great change
say the knowledge thereof is with god alone
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
verily allah hath gotten ready for the infidels a fire and hath gotten ready for them a blaze
they will abide in it for ever and will find no saviour or helper
and when their faces are blackened “ alas – if only i had not been given the fire ”
they will say our lord
and they will say our lord give us double torment and curse them with a great torment
our lord
and we sent a curse upon them and upon them a mighty curse
o you who believe
god is a messenger from what they say
o you who believe
and fear allah and speak in truth
he will rectify your conduct for you and forgive you your sins
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle he hath indeed achieved a mighty achievement
we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to carry it and man carried it on the same man was shameful and man carried it
and man is ever a woman who is given up to allah
and he is very iniquitous and very ignorant
that god may chastise the hypocrites men and women alike and that god may chastise the idolaters men and women alike and god is allforgiving allcompassionate
all the praises and thanks be to allah
and he is the allwise the allknower
he knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it what comes down from the heaven and what ascends thereto
he is the forgiver the merciful
the unbelievers say the hour will not come to us
say yes by my lord it will come to you
and there escapeth not the weight of an ant in the heavens or the earth nor in the heavens nor in the earth
and all things conform to a manifest law
that he may reward those who believe and do the right for them
for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
and those who strive against our signs in order to defeat will be brought into the punishment of painful punishment
those who have been given knowledge see that what is in the heavens and the earth and that which is sent down to thee from thy lord
and the disbelievers said “ shall we point you to a man who is in open error ”
has he invented a lie against allah or is he possessed
nay but those who disbelieve in the hereafter are themselves in a torment and in far error
have they not seen what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth
if we will we can bury them into the earth or cause a part of the sky to fall on them
verily in this is a sign for every faithful believer that believes in the oneness of allah and turns to allah in all affairs with humility and in repentance
and indeed we gave dawud david and sulaiman solomon – so proclaim his purity with him and also give glad tidings o you people
and we sent down iron wherein is great strength and severe punishment
make long coats of mail we said and fix their links and do the right
o family of dawud david with thanks
i am wellacquainted with what you do
and we subjected the wind its morning stride from sunrise till midnoon was a months journey and its afternoon stride from the midday decline of the sun to sunset was a months journey
and of the jinn were some who worked before him by the leave of his lord and among them who swerved away from our command we shall cause him to taste the torment of the blaze
they worked for him whatsoever he pleased of lofty halls and statues and basins like cisterns and cauldrons standing firm
o family of dawud david with thanks
but few among my creatures are thankful
then he turned his back to the land and said “ o my lord
then when he came to it the pride that they had remained in their homes he said “ i did not send the ignorant ”
indeed there was a sign in the house of saba in their habitations two groups on the right and on the left and on the left and on the left and on the left and the left and they were your fathers and they said to him purity is
your lord is allforgiving allthankful
but they turned away then we sent upon them the flood of arim and we gave them in exchange for their two gardens two gardens bearing bitter produce and tamariskbushes and here and here and here and there are other gardens with them and they remained their intestines or
thus we requited them because they were ungrateful disbelievers
and never do we requit in such a way except those who are ungrateful disbelievers
and we led the children of adam on the sea and we led them astray because they were in the way of allah and we led them astray in the way of security and we led them astray with our will and we will not guide them to the
they will say our lord
and we made them leaders and the people of the towns which we gave them and we made them a trial for mankind and we made them equal in living with our sight and we made them generations replacing each other
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and assuredly iblis found his conjecture true concerning them and they followed him all save a party of the believers
and we have not kept this in this quran for mankind in this quran thy lord is ever allknower of everything
say call on those you imagine are gods apart from god
they have no master of the weight of an atom or a small ant either in the heavens or in the earth nor have they any supporter from among them
his intercession avails with him not anything
then when he saw the sun shining brightly he said “ my lord this is my lord
and he is the most high the most great
say who gives you food from the heavens and the earth
surely either you or we are in clear error
say you will not be questioned about their sins neither shall we be questioned as to what you do
say our lord will gather us together and judge between us equitably
he is the deliverer the allknowing
say show me those you associate with him as compeers
no
and he is the allmighty the allwise
we have sent you o muhammad saw as a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a warner to mankind but most men know not
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say thou the appointment to you is for a day which ye can not put back for a single hour nor advance
and those who disbelieve say we believe in that which hath been sent down before and in that which is sent down of the book before it and some we believe in it
those who were conceited will say to those who were subdued “ did we not make you taste the guidance after it came to you
nay but you were mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disobedient to allah etc
those who were deemed weak will say to those who were arrogant nay but it is these who were stiffnecked certainly we have destroyed them by night and in the day and in the morning
and they will say nay but god did not break their pride and disbelief and we did not believe in what you used to do
but we shall put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved
never did we send a warner but they said we disbelieve in what you have been sent with
and they say we are more numerous in riches and children and we are not going to be tormented
say verily my lord increases or restricts the provision of whosoever he will
but most men do not understand
it is not your wealth nor your children that shall bring you nigh
these shall be given their reward twice over because they are the best of these things
and those who strive in our signs in order to defeat will be brought into the punishment
say thou verily my lord expandeth provision for whomsoever he listeth of his bondmen and stinteth it for whomsoever he will
and whatever you spend in good surely god is sure to take to him
he is the best of providers
on the day he will gather them together he will say did it not tell you what you used to do
they will say glory be to thee
they said “ our lord
nay but they used to worship the jinns most of them were believers in them
so today none of you shall have power to profit or hurt one another
and we shall say to the evildoers taste the chastisement of the fire which you cried lies to
and when our clear verses are recited to them they say “ this is nothing but a man who wishes to turn you away from your gods ”
and when the truth is come to them the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them this is nothing but pure sorcery
and we had not sent down to them any herald of warning before you o muhammad saw except as we sent a messenger towards you
and those before them belied and these have not arrived unto a tithe of that which we vouchsafed unto them
they belied my apostles so how terrible was my disapproval
say thou i only exhort you one thing that ye stand in twos and singly and ponder in your companion there is no madness he is naught but a warner unto you preceding a torment afflictive
he is but a terrible chastisement
say i do not ask of you a wage for this
my reward is only from god and he is not powerful over everything
and he is of everything a witness
say my lord casts the truth
he is the allknower of the ghaib unseen and the seen
say truth has come and falsehood has vanished away
say if i am better guide me to the right way
verily he is allhearing and alltoonear
if you could but see when they will be forced into a terror from which they will be unable to escape and are seized from a place nearby wherever they come to turn their faces
and they say we believe in it
but they are called from a place far away
they disbelieved in it before and they were in a place of safety from a distant place
and a barrier will be set between them and what they desire as was done with their partisans before them
verily they have been in doubt perplexing
all praise be to god the originator of the heavens and the earth who appointed angels as his messengers with wings two three and four
he increases in creation what he wills
verily allah is able to do all things
there is no god but he and whatever he opens up to men none can withhold and whatever he withholds
and he is the allmighty the allwise
o mankind
and remember allahs favour upon you
is not allah best for you to provide you sustenance from the sky and the earth
there is no god but he
whither away then turn ye away
and if they belie thee then surely apostles have been belied before thee
and to allah return all matters for decision
o mankind
god is certainly true account
let not the life of the world beguile you and let not the great beguiler beguile you in regard to allah
verily shaitan satan is an enemy to you so take treat him as an enemy
he only invites his hizb followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing fire
those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and do righteous good deeds for them is forgiveness and a great reward ie paradise
is he then whose evil of the work hath been made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it be as he who rightly perceiveth the truth
god guides whom he wills to a straight way
and allah is the allknower of what they do
it is god who sends the winds that raise the clouds and we drive it to a dead land and restore the dead land and revive thereby the earth after it had died
even so
whosoever desires honour power and glory belong to god all honour power and glory and glory and he is the good of all things
and those who plot evilstheirs shall be a torment severe and the plotting of thoseit shall perish
god created you of dust then of a spermdrop then he made you pairs
no female beareth or bringeth forth but with his knowledge nor bringeth forth aught but with his knowledge
and no aged man growth old nor is aught diminished of his life but it is in a book surely that is easy for allah
and the two seas kinds of water are not alike this sweet thirst quenching pleasant to drink and that saltish and bitter
and from among them is a sign for you that you eat fresh meat from it ornaments that you wear
and thou beholdest ships ploughing therein and therein that ye may seek his grace and that haply ye may give thanks
he makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and the sun and the moon and the stars are subjected by his leave
he has subjected the sun and the moon to continue going round each running its course for a term appointed
such is allah your lord
the one the omnipotent
if you call upon them they will not hear your prayer and if they heard they could not answer you
and on the day of resurrection they will disown your worshipping them
none can declare unto thee like him who is aware
o mankind
it is you who are the ones that are in need of god
and allah is rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
if he wills he can take you away and bring a new creation
and this is not hard for allah
and no burdened soul bears another soul ’s burden and if one heavily burdened soul calls another to be given the burden of it – and no burdened soul will carry another
you can only warn those who fear their lord unseen and perform the prayer
then he who purifies himself from all kinds of sins and evil deeds
and allah is ever unto you ever is the final return
nor are alike the shade and the suns heat
nor darkness and light
nor shade and heat of sunshine
nor alike are the living and the dead
god guides whom he wills in their tombs
and you can not make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they have gone astray
you o muhammad saw are only a warner ie your duty is to convey allahs message to mankind but the guidance is in allahs hand
we have sent you with the truth to give glad tidings and to warn
and if they belie thee then surely there have belied the messengers so they are a people who were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
then i seized them and how was my retribution
beholdest thou not that allah sendeth down water from the heaven and then we thereby bring fruit of diverse colours and in the mountains are steaks white and red of diverse colours and also intensely black
and of mankind and beasts and cattle likewise of diverse colours
only those of his creatures fear god who have knowledge
verily allah is oftforgiving most ready to appreciate the deeds of those who are obedient to him
verily those who recite the book of allah and perform the prayer and expend of that we have provided them secretly and in public hope for a commerce that comes not to naught
that he may pay them their wages in full and enrich them of his grace
he is oftforgiving most ready to appreciate good deeds and to recompense
and what we have revealed to you of the book is the truth confirming what preceded it and proves what is before it to be a far more grievous
verily allah is ever allknower allseer of his slaves
then we made our chosen bondmen the inheritors of the book those among them who have been oppressed and among them is one who wrongs himself and among them is one who wrongs himself and among them is a wrong
some of them wrong themselves and of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some who wrong themselves
that is the supreme grace
adn eden paradise everlasting gardens will they enter therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments there will be of silk ie in paradise
and they will say all the praises and thanks be to allah who has removed from us all grief
verily our lord is oftforgiving most ready to appreciate good deeds and to recompense
who has settled us in the mansions of the world and has caused the arrogant to enter into the land no weariness will come to us
and for those who disbelieve there is the fire of hell and theirs shall be the torment of burning
thus we requite every ingrate
therein they will cry our lord
“ we shall now cause a better than the entire household ”
did we not give you long enough so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive admonition therein and that he had left it is not known the day of resurrection
and there came to you the warner truly for you
so now taste the punishment and there will be no savior
verily allah is the allknower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth
he knows what is in the hearts of men
he it is who has made you successors in the earth
and for the infidels their infidelity increaseth with their lord naught save abhorence
and for the infidels their infidelity increastth naught save loss
say have you considered your associates on whom you call apart from god
show me what they have created of the earth
or have they any share in the heavens
or have we given them a book so that they are on a clear proof therefrom
nay the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc promise each other but delusions
verily allah withholdeth the heavens and the earth lest they cease and should they cease not any one could withhold them after him
he is indeed forbearing and forgiving
they swore by allah most vehemently in their oaths that if any herald of warning came to them they would be given birth
waxing proud in the land and evil devising encompasses only those who do not believe in the earth
await they just for the days of the former communities
and thou shalt never find any changing the wo nt of god and thou shalt never find any altering the wo nt of god
have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them
and allah is not such that anything in the heavens and the earth can break away from him
verily he is over everything potent
if god were to seize men for their doings not a living being would be left on the earth but he gives them respite for their own term surely god sees everything
yasin
by the quran full of wisdom
you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are indeed one of the noble messengers
on a straight path
the sending down of the book is from allah the most beneficent the allmighty the allwise
that you may warn a people whose ancestors were not warned so they are negligent
the sentence of truth is justified against most of them so they will not believe
we have put shackles around their necks reaching up to the chins so that their heads are forced up
and we have put a barrier before them and a barrier behind them and a barrier until they have covered them so that they do not see
alike it is to them whether thou hast warned them or thou hast not warned them they do not believe
you can only warn him who follows the reminder the quran and fears the most beneficent allah unseen
so give him the glad tidings of forgiveness and a generous reward
verily we will guicken the dead and we write down that which they send before and their footsteps
and everything we have numbered in a book luminous
and relate to them the signs of the people of the city – when the messengers came to it
when we sent them two messengers they said we have sent a third to strengthen them and we sent them two
they said you are only men like us
what do you say against the allmerciful know you know not
you are speaking only lies
they said our lord knows that we have been sent to you
and on us is naught but manifest preaching
they said we augur ill of you
if you do not desist we shall stone you and inflict a grievous punishment on you
they said your evil augury is with you
is it a sign for you
nay but you are a people who behave senselessly
and there came a man running from the farthest end of the city
follow the messengers
follow those who ask not of you for any hire and who are rightly guided
what aileth me that ye succour me not one who hath created me
shall i take beside the compassionate females when they can not succour me
in that case i should indeed be in manifest error
i believe in your lord so listen to me
it was said enter thou the garden
he said would that my people knew
that my lord has forgiven me and that he has placed me among the honoured ones
and we sent not against his people after him a host from heaven nor did we send such a thing
it was only one cry and lo they were silent and still
alas for men
and never came a messenger to them but they used to mock at him
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them who will not return again
and they all shall return to us
and a sign for them is the dead land
and we brought forth from it grain and vegetation
and we have made therein gardens of datepalms and vines and we therein cause to gush forth springs
so that they may eat from its fruits whereas they are not manufactured by their hands
will they not then give thanks
glory be to him exalted be he above all that they associate with him
and a sign for them is the night
we strip off the day from him night and day darkness into light
and the sun runs on its course for a term appointed
that is the ordinance of the mighty the knower
and the moon we have determined by stations till it returns like an aged palmbough
it is not for the sun to overtake the moon nor does the night outstrip the day
every time they shall be thrown down by a act in the command of its lord
and a sign for them is that we lodged them in a laden ship while they were in their forefathers backs
and we have created for them of the like thereunto whereon they ride
and if we will we shall drown them and there will be no shout or helper for them nor will they be saved
unless by our benevolence to reap advantage for a time
and when it is said to them fear what is before you and what is behind you that you may receive mercy what is behind you
and never does a sign come to them from among their lord but they turn away from it
and when it is said to them “ spend in allahs cause from what we have provided you ” they say “ if allah has provided you ” – and when it is said to them “ offer you victory ” – they will not be recognised in the
you are only in palpable error
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
they await just one scream which will overcome them while they are involved in worldly disputes
then they will not be able to make bequest nor they will return to their family
and the trumpet will be blown – so they will come forth from the graves running towards their lord
saying alas for us
who roused us out of our sleeping place
this is what the most gracious had promised and the noble messengers had spoken the truth ”
it will be but one shout and lo they will all be brought together before us
on that day no soul will be recompensed except for what it had earned
verily the dwellers of the paradise that day will be busy in joyful things
they and their spouses in shade on couches shall be reclining
therein fruits and palmtrees and pomegranates
peace shall be unto them peace
and separate yourselves this day o ye culprits
o children of adam did i not serve you o you assembly that this is a clear foe to you
and that you shall worship me alone
this is a straight path
and he beguiled a great many of you
did you not understand
this is hell that you were promised
roast in it today for that you were unbelievers
this day we shall seal up their mouths and their hands will speak to us and their legs will bear witness against what they used to earn
and if we listed surely we should wipe out their eyes so that they would struggle for the way how then would they see
then how can he be able to pass
and if we listed surely we should transform them in their places so that they would be able neither to go forward nor to return
and whomsoever we grant long life we reverse him in creation
will they not then understand
and we have not taught him muhammad saw poetry nor is it meet for him
this is only revelation communicated
that he may warn him who is alive and feels secure
have they not seen how we have created for them of what our hands have worked for them of that our hands have not the cattle so that they own
and we have subdued them to them so that some of them they have for riding and some of them they feed
and they have therefrom other benefits and drinks
will they not then give thanks
and they have taken besides allah aliha gods hoping that they may be helped by those so called gods
they can not help them and they will be brought forward as a troop against them
and let not their speech grieve thee
we certainly know what they hide and disclose
does man not see that we have created him from nutfah mixed male and female discharge semen drops
this is an evident manifest trial
and he invents a similitude for us he forgets his own creation he says who shall quicken the bones when they are decayed
say he who created them for the first time and he is the last the first creation
who giveth you out of the green tree fire and lo ye kindle therewith
is not he who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them
verily he is the allknower of everything
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
blessed be he in whose hand is the dominion of everything
and to him you shall be returned
by the angels who release with gentle release
and those angels who drive the clouds in a good way
and by oath of those who recite the reminder
verily your god is one
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and lord of the easts
we have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars
and to guard against every rebellious devil
they can not listen to the exalted assembly and they are darted at from every side
and theirs shall be a torment ignominous
except one who sometimes steals a part so a blazing flame goes after him
so ask them o muhammad saw are they stronger in constitution or those we created
we created them of clinging clay
nay you o muhammad saw wondered at their insolence while they mock at you and at the quran
and when they are reminded they pay no attention
and when they see a sign they mock at it
and they say this is nothing but manifest sorcery
when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we indeed be raised up
and also our forefathers
say yes and you shall then be of those brought nigh
it will be but a single saihah shout etc so behold they will be staring
saying alas for us
this is the day of judgement
this is the day of judgement which you used to deny
gather all the wicked together and their comrades and those they had worshipped
god shall gather them all together
and halt them to be questioned
what is the matter with you that you do not help one another
nay but they will be in surrender
and some of them will confront the others
they will say it was you who used to come to us from the right side of the right side
they will say nay you yourselves were not believers
we had no authority over you nay but you were a people guilty
the sentence of our lord has come true for us
we shall certainly taste the punishment
that is the expiation for your oaths
we are the rangers
so verily on that day they all in the torment will be sharers
thus do we deal with the mujrimun polytheists disbelievers sinners criminals etc
and when it is said to them “ allah there is no god except him ” they grew arrogant
and they said are we going to abandon our aliha gods for the sake of a mad poet
in fact he has brought the truth and testified for the noble messengers
you will surely be requited for what you had done
and be rewarded but only for what you had done
except the chosen slaves of allah faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
for them is an appointed sustenance
and allah is ever allhearer allseer
in gardens of tranquility
in gardens of peace
sitting on couches face to face
with goblets ready placed therein two springs
white delicious to the drinkers
there shall be neither headiness nor will they be inebriated
and with them wideeyed maidens restraining their glances
as if they were eggs safely hidden
and some of them draw near to others questioning
one of them says i had a comrade
who used to say are you among those who believe in resurrection after death
when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we then indeed be raised up
he said “ had it not been that my lord had destroyed me with the fire and made him a prison and a mercy willing you would have been ruined ”
then he looked down and saw him in the midst of the fire
he said by allah you certainly tried me
and but for the favourcf my lord i should have been of those brought forward
except our first death and we shall not be punished
what when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we then indeed be raised up
that is the supreme achievement
for the like of this let the workers work
is this better as an entertainment or the tree of zaqqum
we have indeed made this qur’an a punishment for the unjust
it is a tree that comes forth in the root of hell
the shoots of its fruitstalks are like the heads of shayatin devils
verily they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith
then on top of it they will be given boiling water to drink so that they will be given to drink of it
then verily their return is to hell
verily they found their fathers gone astray
and they run in their footsteps
and assuredly there went stray before them many of the ancients
and indeed we sent among them warners messengers
so behold what wise hath been the end of those who were warned
except the chosen bondmen of allah
and indeed nuh noah invoked us and we are the best of those who answer the request
and we rescued him and his people from the great calamity
and his progeny them we made the survivors ie shem ham and japheth
peace be upon ilyas
peace be upon noah among all beings
thus do we reward the virtuous
verily he was one of our believing slaves
then we drowned the others
and abraham indeed was of his inducement
when he came to his lord with a heart compliant
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
and do you worship besides allah that which neither profits nor harms them
what then is your opinion of the lord of the worlds
then he turned away privately
and he said verily i am sick with plague he did this trick to remain in their temple of idols to destroy them and not to accompany them to the pagans feast
but they turned their backs on him and went away
so he went forth with them saying will you not be godfearing
what is the matter with you that you do not say
then he turned upon them striking them with his right hand
so the disbelievers came running towards him
he said worship ye that which carve
and allah hath created you and that which ye make
they said build for him a building it is said that the building was like a furnace and throw him into the blazing fire
they desired to outwit him so we made them the lower ones
and he said verily i am going to my lord who will guide me
“ and he will guide me ”
he said my lord
give me one of the righteous
so we gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy
and when he had reached the age of running with him he said o my son i dreamt that i am sacrificing you
so behold what wise hath been my reckoning
o yusuf joseph
he said what think you are not aware of what you do
allah willing you will soon find me patient
then when they had submitted themselves to allah and he took his forehead or on his side
we called out to him o abraham
you have fulfilled your dream
thus do we reward the doers of good
this is a clear favour indeed
and we ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice
and we left for him among the posterity
peace be upon abraham
thus do we reward the virtuous
verily he was one of our believing slaves
and we gave him the glad tidings of ishaq a herald of the hidden from among those who deserve our proximity
and we blessed him and isaac
and among their descendants are some who wrong themselves and some who are wicked are unjust
we also favoured moses and aaron
and we delivered them and their people from the great distress
and we helped them so that they became the victors
and we gave them the manifesting book
and guided them to the straight path
and we left for them among the posterity
peace be upon moses and aaron
thus do we reward the virtuous
they are two of our believing servants
and verily iliyas elias was one of the messengers
when he said to his people will you not be mindful of god
and he said to his people will you not fear allah the lord of your fathers the dominion of your fathers the ancients
god your lord and the lord of your fathers the ancients
so they denied him and will not be seized by the torment and they will not be able to repel
except the chosen bondmen of allah
and we left for him among the posterity
peace be upon elias
thus do we reward the virtuous
verily he was one of our believing slaves
and verily lout lot was one of the messengers
when we saved him and his family all
except his wife we destined her to be of those who remained behind
then we destroyed the others
and in the morning you would not have made their dwellings to read it
will you not then understand
verily jonah is one of the apostles
when he fled on the laden ship
he agreed to cast lots and he was among the losers
then the whale swallowed him down and he blameworthy
had he not been one of those who struggled hard
he would have tarried in its belly until the day when all will be raised
then we cast him sick on a barren shore
and we grew a tree of gourd as a shelter above him
we sent him to a hundred thousand men or more
and they believed so we gave them enjoyment for a while
now ask them o muhammad saw are there only daughters for your lord and sons for them
or did we create the angels females while they were witnesses
is it not a lie invented by them when they say
lo verily it is a band small
they are indeed liars
has he chosen daughters above sons
what ails you then how you judge
will you not then contemplate
or have you received some clear authority
then bring your book if you speak truly
and they have invented a kinship between him and the jinns and the jinns know that they have indeed to appear before him and they will know that they have to be brought back with him
hallowed be allah from that which they ascribe to him
except the chosen bondmen of allah
so neither are you serving what you serve
can you not see any one except him whom allah has created all things
except one who will be roasted in the fire
and we are those who sing hallelujas to him
and we are the rangers
and we are the rangers
and indeed they arab pagans used to say
if we had the account of earlier people with us
we would have been the chosen creatures of god
yet they disbelieve therein presently they shall know
and assuredly our word hath already gone forth our bondmen the sent ones
that they would be helped
and that our hosts they verily would be the victors
so turn thou from them for a time
and see them soon they shall see
seek haste then they with our torment
when it lights in their courtyard how evil will be the morning of them that are warned
so turn thou from them for a time
and see them soon they shall see
hallowed be thine lord the lord of majesty from that which they ascribe
and peace be upon the envoys
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
sad
by the mount
the unbelievers are in vain assembly false pride and opposition
how many generations have we destroyed before them who cried for mercy when it was too late for escape
they were surprised that a warner against them when a herald of warning came to them from among themselves and the unbelievers say this is a lying sorcerer
they were surprised that one god has come to them from among themselves and the unbelievers say he is a deceiving sorcerer
this is indeed a strange thing
the chiefs among them departed saying go to us and follow your gods
he wishes to purify himself
we never heard of this among the people of the city
this is nothing but an invention
“ has the remembrance been sent down to him out of us all matters ”
nay they are in doubt of my admonition
or do they hold the treasures of the mercy of your lord the allmighty the real bestower
or is theirs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them so that they can outstrip
then let them climb up the ladders to the heavens
they will be a host in confederates only a defeated
the people of noah arrass and thamud denied before you
and the thamud and the people of lut and the dwellers of the wood these were the confederates
not one of them but belied the apostles wherefore justified was my wrath
they await just one scream which no one can avert
they will say our lord
they say our share quickly before the day of reckoning
and bear thou patiently what they say and remember our bondman daud endured with strength verily he was oftreturning onto us
verily we were subjected to him the mountains that was with him in the night and at the ends of day and at the prostrations
and the birds gathered together they were all obedient to him
and we strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and decisive speech
has the story of moses come to you
when they scaled over the wall into dawud ’s mosque
when they entered in david and they said fear not we are two disputants one of them has wronged the other
they said fear not verily we are two classes
“ and do not judge between us with equity and let him be unjust and guide us to the right way ”
this is a thing in order to be blind
said dawud “ he is being unjust to you in order that he demands to add your ewe to his ewes and only one who has accepted faith except a few and accepted faith – only a few among them do good deeds – only few among them are
and we have appointed for him his offspring in the heavens and in the earth and also are signs for him
o dawud
so judge between men equitably and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the way of god
verily those who wander astray from the path of allah will be a severe torment because they forgot the day of reckoning
and we have not created the heaven and the earth and all that is between them unnecessarily
that is the opinion of those who disbelieve
so woe to the unbelievers for the fire
shall we equate those who do the right with those who spread corruption in the land or cause corruption in the land
we have sent down to you the book which we have sent down to you so that you may ponder its verses and that men of wisdom may remember
and david solomon inherited the land
how excellent a slave
verily he was ever oftreturning in repentance to us
when the night is over him in the day when he calls to him that he is in the land and the standing steeds
he said “ i have indeed taken the refuge of my lord – the horses is worthy of being abandoned ”
bring them back to me and he began to rub and stroke their shanks and necks
and we tried solomon and we cast upon his throne a mere body
then he turned back striving in his effort
he said my lord
my lord make me a performer of the believers and so make my presence a viceroy
verily you are the bestower
we subjected to him the wind it blew gently to his order whithersoever he willed
and we subjected to him the jinns every kind of builder and diver
and we have given them his signs in which they were bound
this is our gift bestow or withhold without reckoning
and he shall have an approach with us and an excellent abode
and remember our bondman ayyub job when he cried out to his lord “ surely the devil has struck me with hardship and pain ”
stamp thy foot
this cold water is for bathing and for drinking
and we bestowed on him ishaq and yaqub and we placed among his posterity prophethood and the book and we vouchsafed unto him his hire in the world and in the hereafter he shall be of the righteous
and take in thy hand a bundle of rushes and strike therewith and do not fail in thy oath
and it is we who have made it an abode and as a comfort
we found him patient
how excellent a slave
and remember our slaves ibrahim abraham ishaque isaac and yaqub jacob all owners of strength in worshipping us and also of religious understanding
we distinguished them with a distinct quality the remembrance of the abode
and in our sight they are indeed the chosen the excellent
and ismail ishmael and idris enoch and dhulkifl isaiah all were from among assabirin the patient ones etc
and of them are the best
this is a commemoration
for those who take heed for themselves is an excellent place of return
gardens of eden with gates open wide to them
therein they will recline therein they will call for fruits in abundance and drinks
and with them will be chaste females virgins restraining their glances only for their husbands and of equal ages
this is what you are promised for the day of reckoning
this is our provision there will surely be no ceasing thereof
thus it is
and for the taghun transgressors disobedient to allah and his messenger disbelievers in the oneness of allah criminals etc will be an evil final return fire
hell in which they will burn and worst indeed is that destination
this is so let them taste it boiling water and pus
and other torments like thereof conjoined
this is a troop rushing in along with you o people who have been driven forth from the city
peace be upon you
they will burn in the fire
they will say nay it is you who will be an nt to be requited for you
it is you who brought this calamity upon us
and what a wretched place to return
they will say our lord
they will say who has brought this upon us a double torment in the fire
and they will say what is the matter with us that we see not men whom we counted among the wicked
did we take them as a mockery or what they had been mocking
this is a fire that will be belied
say i am only a warner and there is no god but god the one the omnipotent
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – the one who is the great strength of the oft forgiving the most merciful
say that is a great tidings
from which you are turning away
what do i know what the angels have come to me
naught is inspired in me except that i am a plain warner
when your lord said to the angels i am going to create a man from clay
and when i have fashioned him and breathed into him of my spirit fall down prostrating with him
so the angels prostrated themselves all of them together
but iblis did not prove and did transgress beyond bounds in the disobedience of allah
allah said o iblis
what is the matter with me that i created by my own sons
becomest thou stiffnecked or art thou of the exalted ones
he said i am better than he thou createdst me of fire and him thou createdst of clay
he said i am better than he you created me from fire and him thou createdst of clay
said he get thee forth therefrom verify thou art driven away
and verily on thee shall be the day of requital
he said my lord
said he respite me till the day they shall be raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
till the day of the time appointed
he said by thy majesty then i shall surely seduce them all together
except your chosen slaves amongst them faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
said he truth is and the truth i say
i will fill hell with you iblis that i will fill hell with you iblis that i will fill hell with jinn and men all together
say i do not ask of you a wage for this nor am i of the things that do
it is naught but an admonition unto the worlds
and you will come to know its tidings after a while
the revelation of the book is from allah the most honourable the all knowing
we have sent down the book to you with the truth so worship god devoting yourself to him
lo for allah is the religion exclusive
and those who take protectors apart from him say we worship them that they may bring us near at us in order that we may bring them nearer to god
verily allah will judge between them in what they differ
god guides not him who is a liar unthankful
had god desired to take to him a son he would have chosen whatever he willed from that he has created
glory be to him
allah the one the irresistible
he created the heavens and the earth with deliberation and gave the alternation of night and day and he has subjected the sun and the moon each one runs its course for its appointed term
and the sun and the moon are running to a fixed course for a term appointed
he is allmighty and forgiving
he created you of a single soul then made his spouse therefrom his spouse that he might rest in them and of his seed he hath sent down
he creates you in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation in threefold darkness
such is allah your lord
his is the dominion there is no god but he
there is no god but he
whither away then turn ye away
if you disbelieve then remember that god is independent of you and he does not like any sincere advisers
if you are grateful by being believers he will approve ingratitude on you
that no burdened person with sins shall bear the burden sins of another
then he will inform you of what you were doing
verily he is the allknower of the innermost secrets of the breasts
when man is afflicted with harm he calls to his lord allah as a witness
then when he gave him a good way he had given him in his way he forgets what he had bestowed on him and he sets up compeers to god
say enjoy your brief life and its torment will be allowed
and what concern do you have regarding the fire ”
is he who is obedient to allah prostrating himself and standing in prayer during the hours of the night fearing the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord like one who disbelieves in the watches of the world to come
say are those who know equal to those who know not
only men possessed of minds remember
say o muhammad saw o my slaves who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism
and fear your lord
this is how allah gives to whomever he wills in the world and in the hereafter is better for those who do good
only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full without reckoning
say i am commanded to serve god making for him the religion his sincerely
and i am commanded this in order that i may be the first of those who submit themselves to allah in islam as muslims
say verily i fear if i disobeyed my lord the torment of a mighty day
say o muhammad saw i worship allah alone by obeying him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for allahs sake only and by doing righteous good deeds sincerely for allahs sake only and not to showoff and not to set up rivals with him in worship
so serve what you will apart from him
say verily the losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection
this is indeed an evident grace from allah
above them shall be a cloud of fire and above them shall be mountains of fire
that is how god gives the bondmen of his creatures need he sees
o my bondmen wherefore fear me
and those who do not worship the devil along – allah has indeed made them a noble messenger from the holy qur’an and the glad tidings of the virtuous people will come to guidance
give thou good tidings to my servants
those who listen to the word and follow what is the best of god and those who are men possessed of minds
is he then who is in the fire will you save him who is in the fire
but for those who fear displeasing their lord there are lofty mansions built above mansions with rivers rippling past below them a promise of god and god does not go back on his promise
this is the supreme law
and allah fails not his promise
hast thou not seen how that god sends down out of heaven water and threaded it as dead as dead as he brings forth therewith as dead as he has sent down out of heaven and he brings it out of heaven and he is not heedless of the
in fact they have submitted ‘ allah has put our trust in allah ’ – so make peace be upon him who follows islam and submission ’
so woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of allah
they wander astray in clear error
allah has sent down the best statement a book which he has sent down ie the quran in which prophet muhammad saw written down the taurat torah and the injeel gospel at its time and their hearts are preserved ie the torment of the blazing fire
then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of allah
and none can lead astray except him whom he wills
is he then who will confront with his face on the day of resurrection as he who enters peacefully in paradise
and it is said to the evildoers taste now that you were earning
those before them belied wherefore so the torment came on them from a barren torment came upon them from a place they perceive not
so allah made them taste humiliation in the life of this world and indeed the punishment of the hereafter is the greatest if only they knew
and assuredly we have propounded for mankind in this quran all kinds of similitudes that haply they may be admonished
we have sent down an arabic koran haply you will understand
god has struck a similitude a man in whom he has made a common man belonging to his master and he was a man who is a partner to him
are they equal in comparison
all the praises and thanks be to allah but most of them know not
verily you o muhammad saw will die and they will die
then on the day of resurrection before your lord you will dispute
and who does greater evil than he who forges against god a lie when he came to him with the truth
is there not in gehenna a lodging for the unbelievers
and he who brings the truth and verifies it such are the people who are godfearing
they shall have whatsoever they will desire with their lord
this is the reward of the virtuous
that is the best of what they used to do and what they used to do
is not allah sufficient for his slave
and they threaten you with others beside him
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there will be no guide
and whomsoever allah guides he is the guided he
is not allah allmighty the lord of retribution
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say allah
say have you considered if god wills to give you provision from him if you are believers
say god is enough for me
the trusting place their trust in him
say o muhammad saw o my people
and say to them keep on with your works in your works in your positions i am doing mine
you will come to know
to whom will come a chastisement degrading him and upon whom lights a lasting chastisement
we have sent down to you the book containing the truth in order that you may be certain
he who finds the right path does so for himself and he who strays astray does so for his own good and he who strays has strayed for his own harm and no harm
and you are not a wakil disposer of your affairs or a watcher over them
god is aware of the things you do
then he keeps back those ordained death and sends the rest for a time ordained death and sends the rest of those who stay behind
verily in that is a sign for men of understanding
have they taken others for intercessors beside allah
say thou what even though they own not aught and understand not
say thou allahs is intercession altogether
his is the dominion of the heavens and the earth
then to him you shall be returned
and when allah alone is mentioned the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter are filled with disgust from the oneness of allah and when those who deny the faith of the oneness of allah or worship others besides him are mentioned ie when those who believe
say o muhammad saw o allah creator of the heavens and the earth
the creator of the heavens and the earth will judge between your slaves about which they used to differ
and if the evildoers possessed all that is in the earth and the like of it again they would offer it to ransom themselves therewith of the chastisement on the day of resurrection and the chastisement
and the evils of their deeds appeared to them and they used to mock at surrounded them
and when some affliction visits a man he calls upon us from us then when we confer on him a blessing from us he says it is a manifest loss
nay it is a trial but most of them know not
those before them said surely there had been aught that they earned did not avail them
so the punishment for them is the recompense of what they earned and they will not be able to do with him
do they not know that allah eases the sustenance for whomever he wills and restricts it
verily in that are indeed signs for a people who believe
say o ibadi my slaves who have transgressed against themselves by committing evil deeds and sins
despair not of gods mercy verily allah forgives all sins
he is the forgiving the merciful
turn to your lord and surrender to him before the chastisement comes upon you then you will not be helped
follow the best of what has been revealed to you by your lord before the punishment overtakes you suddenly and you are caught unawares
he said “ do not disgrace me when i was mistaken ”
or lest it should say if only god had guided me i should have been a man of the godfearing
or lest it should say when it sees the torment if only i had another chance to return to my world then surely i should be among the righteous good deeds
yea surely my signs came unto thee and thou beliedest them and wast stiffnecked and wast of the infidels
and on the day of resurrection thou shalt see those who lied against allah their faces blackened
is there not in hell an abode for the arrogant ones
and allah will rescue those who fear him and guide them to places of safety
neither will evil touch them nor regret
god is the creator of everything and he is guardian over everything
to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth and those who deny our signs and deny the revelations of god
say o muhammad saw to the polytheists etc of allah
and assuredly we have sent down unto thee from before thee then thou hast surely become an of the losers
but god should worship and be among the thankful
they did not realise it is god who guides to himself whoever is in his place
high be he exalted above that they associate with him
and the trumpet will be blown and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away except him whom allah wills
then it shall be sounded the second time they will stand up for destruction
and the earth will shine with the light of its lord when the book will be established and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought and the book will be placed in full and the witnesses will be given full view in the grave doubt and they will
each soul will be paid in full for what it had done
and allah is the allknower of what they do
and those who disbelieve will be driven onto hell in groups till when they reach it its gates will be opened and its guards will be opened and its guards will say to them did not the messengers come to you from amongst you reciting unto them your verses
they will say yes but the word of punishment proved true upon the disbelievers
enter the gates of hell to abide therein
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
and those who feared their lord will be driven in companies into paradise till when they have come thither and its gates will be opened and its gates are opened and its keepers will say to them peace be upon you enter paradise
enter the gates of hell to abide therein
and they will say all the praises and thanks be to allah who has fulfilled his promise to us and has made us inherit this land
excellent is the hire of the workers
and you will see the angels surrounding the throne of allah from all round glorifying the praises of their lord allah
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
hamim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of the book is from allah the most honourable the all knowing
forgiver of trespasses acceptor of repentance severe in chastisement lord of power
there is no god but he
to him is the return of all
so let not their ability of going about here and there through the revelations of allah that they may not be able to move about in the land
the people of noah before them cried lies then we destroyed them for a people who were evil
thus hath the word of thy lord been justified against the wrongdoers
those who bear the throne and those who are round about it proclaim the purity of their lord while praising him and believe in the evening and they say our lord
and save us thou from the torment of the fire
our lord
and admit them to the gardens of everlasting stay eden – and to those who were virtuous and to their fathers and their wives and their offspring
verily you are the allmighty the allwise
and save them from the torment because of that which ye have earned and whosoever is saved from the torment of that day he hath surely mercy and that is with them that day of a surety shall be of mercy
that is the supreme achievement
those who disbelieve will surely be addressed by the prophet muhammad saw but allah is greater than the believers and the hypocrites will certainly disgrace them when you were called upon the fire of hell
they will say our lord
“ you have given us death twice you have given us death and twice you made us die ”
we admit our sins
is there any way to come out
this is because you used to do evil deeds
so god is allhigh and supreme
it is he who shows you his signs and sends down sustenance from the skies and the blessings of the sky
but only the reminder and the faithful
so call on god with exclusive obedience howsoever the unbelievers may dislike it
lord of the throne the allglorious
he sends the inspiration by his command to any of his slaves that he may warn the day of meeting ie the day of resurrection that he may warn men of the day of meeting of the day of resurrection
the day when they will come out of their graves in all haste will be of them rushing towards allah
whose is the kingdom today
allah the one the irresistible
there will be no soul will be recompensed for what it had earned
god is swift in reckoning
and warn them of the day when the hearts will be choking with anguish when the hearts will be terrified they neither decrease nor decrease nor decrease in the hours
he knows the deceptions of the eyes and what the hearts conceal
god decides with justice those they invoke apart from him can not adjudge in the least
verily allah is allhearing allperceiving
have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them
they were superior to them in strength and in the traces in the land they left behind them
and allah seized them with punishment for their sins and none will defend them against allah
that was because their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they disbelieved in them and allah seized them with an awful torment
and he is allstrong severe in punishment
and indeed we sent musa moses with our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc and a manifest authority
firaun pharaoh haman and qarun but they said a sorcerer a liar
and when he brought the truth from us they said slay the sons of those who believe with him and let their women live
but the unbelievers stratagem is bound to fail
and firaun pharaoh said leave me to kill musa moses and let him call his lord
i fear that he may change your religion or that he may cause corruption to appear in the land
moses said i take refuge in my lord and your lord from every insolent imposter who does not believe in the day of reckoning
and the faith of firaun who used to believe in allah his faith and said “ will you be given a clear proof from your lord ”
and if he is a liar and he speaks the truth as he has forged the falsehood had forged concerning us then the truth
verily allah guides not the people who are alfasiqun the rebellious disobedient to allah
o my people
today the kingdom this day of yours is yours who are masters in the land
who will help us against god if he wills and god is powerful over us
firaun pharaoh said i only explain to you what i see correct and i guide you only to the path of rectitude
and the believer said “ o my people
and when he saw them to say did i not tell you this is the devil ’s group ”
like the people of nuh noah ad and thamud and those after them and ad and thamud and those that were before them and allah does not want to be unjust to his creatures in the least benefit of his creatures
o my people
verily i fear for you the torment of a great day ie a similar day of resurrection
the day when you turn back fleeing away and flee having no protector from allah and whomsoever allah sends astray for him there is no guide
joseph had indeed come to you with clear proofs but you did not cease to doubt in what he had brought you until when you were in doubt about yusuf ’s sight
then when he will see the evildoers even after that god will not make the evildoers see
those who wrangle concerning the signs of allah without any authority having come unto them and that there hath come unto them an evidence and there is a mighty greatly
thus does allah seal up the heart of every arrogant tyrant
firaun pharaoh said o haman
and firaun pharaoh led his chiefs astray from the path and he was hindered me verily i am the guide of the right way
the cords of the heavens and look upon moses god for i think that he is a liar insolent
and thus fair seeming was made unto firawn the evil of his work and he was hindered from the path
and firaun pharaoh led his plot astray but the plot of firawn was naught but in the plot of the affair
and the believer said “ o my people
follow me and follow me i will guide you to the right way
o my people
the life of this world is but a possi enjoyment and a restingplace
whosoever does evil shall be recompensed except with a righteous deed and whosoever does righteous good deeds male or female and is a believer will enter paradise therein they shall have provision in abundance without reckoning
o my people
“ and why should i call you towards salvation whereas you call me towards the fire ”
you call me to disbelieve in god and to associate with him that whereof i have no knowledge while i call you to the allmighty the allforgiving
“ indeed i call you to witness upon my punishment in this world and in the hereafter and they will not be able to be ruined ”
and you will remember what i will know who has been given you
i commit my affair to god
god keeps an eye on his votaries
so god guarded the evil things of their devising and there encompassed the folk of pharaoh the evil chastisement
the day they will be exposed to it morning and evening and the day the punishment will be overwhelmed with despair
and they will all appear before the fire will say to those who were arrogant we were your followers so will you take some of the fire as a double of this and we do not have any supporters
and the followers will say “ we are all in it ”
verily allah has judged between his slaves
and those in the fire will say to the keepers of hell supplicate your lord to lighten for us one day of the chastisement
they will say did there not come unto you their apostles with evidences
they will say yes indeed why not
they will say then do you call
verily we will surely succour our apostles and those who believe in the life of this world and on the day whereon the witnesses will stand forth
the day when their excuses will be of no profit to the evildoers and theirs will be the curse and theirs the day of resurrection
and indeed we gave moosa the guidance and we bequeathed upon the descendants of israel the book
a provision for those who have wisdom
so be patient
god is certainly the promise of truth
and ask forgiveness for thy sin and proclaim the praise of thy lord at evening and dawn
those who wrangle concerning the signs of allah without any authority having come unto them in their breasts any crookedness
for them is a scorching fire
so seek refuge in god
he is allhearing and allseeing
the creation of the heavens and the earth is indeed greater than the creation of mankind but most men do not know
not equal are the blind and the seeing man those who believe and do deeds of righteousness and the wrongdoer
little do you reflect
verily the hour is coming there is no doubt thereof yet most men do not believe
your lord said call your lord to me i will give you the like of this
verily those who disdain worshipping me will enter hell disgraced
it is god who made the night for you to rest the day to make things clear
verily allah is gracious to men albeit most men give not thanks
such is allah your lord the creator of all things la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he where then you will be turning away from almushrikun
how then are you perverted
thus were turned away those who deny the signs of allah
it is god who made the earth a base for you and the sky a canopy and fashioned you thereby producing fruits as food for your sustenance
such is allah your lord
blessed be god the lord of all being
he is the living the sustainer slumber taketh hold of him not nor aught is he
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
say i am forbidden to worship those you call on apart from god since clear signs have come to me from my lord
he it is who created you of dust then of a spermdrop then of a bloodclot then he delivers you as infants then that you may come out of age and you may haply come forth age and thereafter he may haply be full of full strength
and it is he who gives life and causes death
when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
hast thou not regarded those who dispute concerning the signs of god how they are turned about
those who deny the book this quran and what we sent with our apostles will soon come to know
they will come to know
when the fetters and chains are on their necks and they dragged
into the boiling water then into the fire they will be consumed
then it will be said to them “ where are those you used to worship ”
and those whom you worship besides allah can not create anything but are they being created
they will say nay we were wo nt to worship nay but we were not going to worship any other than that against us
thus doth allah lead the infidels astray
this is because you were insolent in the land without right and because you were arrogant in the land without right and because you used to behave proudly on earth
and why should they not turn you away from the commandments of allah whereas they turn away thereafter
how evil is the lodging of those that are proud
so be patient
god is certainly the promise of truth
and indeed we are able to show you o muhammad saw that with which we promise them
and indeed we sent messengers before you o muhammad saw amongst the sects communities of old before you and we sent them to some of them as messengers but allah will make them known in their place and in order that allah may make known the believers
and it is he who has created cattle for you to ride and of some you eat
and there are other benefits in them for you and on them is your elegance when you bring them home and evening and the ships you ride in them and when you go back to pasture your needs
and he shows you his signs so you may understand
which then of the signs and proofs of allah do you deny
have they not travelled on the earth so that they might see what wise hath been the end of those before them
they were greater in strength than they and in the traces on the earth
and there did not benefit them at all they did not compass anything of his sin
so when their messengers came to them with clear proofs they used to mock at them
then when they saw our might they said we believe in allah alone and reject all that we associate with him
but their faith did not avail them when they saw our punishment
a fountain whereat drink the servants of god making it not
then the disbelievers lost utterly when they became in the lost
hamim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
a revelation from the most beneficent allah
a book from god and he is the wise the aware
by the fig and the olive
yet most of them do not listen listen to the truth and do not listen
and they say our hearts are covered against you that you should say unto us that you are under our ears and there is a deafness in our ears and in the land
so you should wait for us and we are the best of the faithless
say i am only a mortal like you are
he is the only one god and he is the only one god
and woe to almushrikun the idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of allah polytheists idolaters etc see v 2105
those who do not give the obligatory charity and who do not accept faith in the hereafter
verily those who believe and do righteous works theirs shall be a hire unending
say what do you seek another creation from him who created the earth in two days and you set up compeers to god
that is the lord of the worlds
and we placed therein firm mountains lest it should shake with them and we placed therein firm mountains lest it should shake with them and he has set therein all kinds of fruits for it
then he lifted himself to heaven when it was smoke and it and said to it we shall bring it up
they said we come willingly
it shall be said to them which is as a sign for seven heavens and in the earth
that is the ordinance of the mighty the knower
then if they turn away say i warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt which came upon a’ad and thamud
when their messengers came to them from before them and from behind them saying “ do not worship anyone but god they said if our lord had willed he would have sent down angels ”
as for ad they were arrogant in the land and they said who is stronger than us in might
did they not see that allah who created them is more powerful than them
and they used to deny our signs
we therefore sent a violent thunderstorm towards them in order to make them taste a disgraceful punishment in the life of this world and in the hereafter
and surely the torment of the hereafter is greater if they but know
and as for thamud we showed them the way and they preferred blindness above guidance so the thunderbolt of the humiliating torment as a humiliating torment in hope
and we rescued those who accepted faith and were pious
on the day when god will gather them together in the fire and they will be set in bands
till when they reach it hellfire their hearing ears and their eyes and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do
and they will say to their skins why bore you witness against us
they will say allah has caused you to speak as he causes all things to speak and he created you the first time and to him you will be returned
you did not hide from him so that your ears and your eyes and your skins may testify against you but you did not know that god did not know the things you do
that thought about your lord has destroyed you and you were lost
then if they are patient their abode is hell and if they plead not for favour even then they will not be given
we have allotted them comrades and they have decked out fair to them that which is before them and behind them and they have decked out fair in the eyes
the sentence of men had passed away before them justified among the communities of jinns and men
verily they were ever the losers
and the disbelievers said “ do not listen to this qur’an and engulf it in noise – perhaps you may be victorious this way ”
we shall surely let the unbelievers taste a terrible chastisement and we shall let them taste a terrible chastisement and the worst of what they were doing
that is the meed of the enemies of allah the fire
they will abide in the fire forever
and those who disbelieve will say our lord
show us those of jinns and men who led us astray as those among jinn and men will say show us our feet so that we may trample them underfoot and make them wholly abject
and those who say our lord is god and then will remain in it – so do not fear nor regret but rejoice in the happy tidings of the promised warnings
we are your friends in this life and in the world to come
therein you shall have all that your innerselves desire and therein you shall have all that your innerselves desire and therein you shall have all that your innerselves desire and therein you shall have all that your innerselves desire
as an entertainment from the oftforgiving most merciful
and who does a better than he who calls to god and says “ i am a muslim ”
not equal are the good deed and the evil deed
repel evil with that which is fairer and behold he between whom and thee as though he was a friend
that is a near relative we worship and that you be dutiful to parents and kinsmen orphans and the poor and the wayfarer and to orphans and the needy and the traveller and whatever good parents do you not take your parents except if you worship him
and if an evil whisper from shaitan satan tries to turn you away and then seek refuge in allah
he is allhearing and allknowing
and of his signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon
prostrate not yourselves unto the sun nor the moon but prostrate unto allah who hath created them if it is he who hath created them and they should not so aught of them
and if they are too proud to do so then they too hallow him night and day and they do not grow weary of doing so they do not tire
and of his signs is that thou beholdest the earth lowly and when we send down water upon it it quivers and swells and puts forth herbs of every command of every person then begins to wither and he has not seen them
verily he who gives life to the dead
verily he is able to do all things
verily those who blaspheme our revelations are not hid from us
is he then who will be cast into the fire better or he who cometh secure on the day of resurrection
do what you will surely be hasty
he is allseer of what you do
and those who disbelieve in the book when it cometh unto them they will be the grip of allah mighty and praiseworthy
falsehood can not come forward it before it or behind it
and verily it is in the original book with us verily the exalted full of wisdom
naught is said to thee but what already was said to the messengers before thee
and verily your lord is swift in retribution
and had we made it a recital in a foreign tongue they would have surely said wherefore are the verses thereof not detailed
say those who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and the true guidance and an healing
they were far away from a distant place
and assuredly we vouchsafed unto musa the book and difference arose concerning it and had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy lord it would have been decreed between them and but for a word that is in doubt concerning which they differ
whosoever worketh righteously it is for his soul and whosoever worketh evil it is only to his own loss
and thine lord is not an oppressor unto his bondmen
when there happeneth event
and its fruit comes forth with its sheath no female bears or brings forth save with a female
and on the day when he will call to them and ask where are my socalled partners of allah who will say where are my socalled partners whom you used to assert
and those they used to worship before will fail them and they will perceive that they have no place of refuge from them
man never tires of praying for good but if evil assails him he begins to despair
and if we let him taste mercy after affliction has visited him he surely says this is mine and if i deem good that he is sure to happen to me surely i was dead in this life to my lord i will not think that the hour is
and when we bless man he turns away and withdraws aside but when evil visits him he is in despair
say thou so as is it from allah and you disbelieve in it whereas it is a further astray than he who is in schism faroff
we shall show them our signs in the horizons and in themselves till it becomes clear to them that its signs is certain to come to them
is not your lord sufficient he is a witness over all things
lo verily they are in doubt concerning the meeting with their lord
he is the guardian over everything

the heavens nearly split apart from above – – and the angels say the purity of their lord while praising him and seek forgiveness for those on earth pay heed
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and allah is ever watching those who take them for friends instead of him
and thus we have revealed unto thee an arabic koran that thou mayest warn the mother of towns and those around it and that thou mayest warn the mother of towns and the day of assembling whensoever there is no doubt thereof
a party of the people are cried lies to the inhabitants of the blaze
and had allah willed he would have made them one community but he causeth whomsoever he will to enter into his mercy
and the wrongdoers have neither any wali protector nor helper
or have they taken for worship auliya guardians supporters helpers protectors etc besides him
but god will not take away the believers
verily he is the quickener of the dead and he is over everything potent
and whatever you differ in anything with allah such is the decision thereof and in that decision is only with allah
in him i have put my trust and to him i turn

and he has made for you mates from yourselves and has made for you mates from yourselves and for the cattle also mates whereby you are yourselves and he has provided for the cattle also mates
there is no other like him and he is the allhearing the allseeing
and with him are the keys of the heavens and the earth
he increases or decreases the fortunes of whosoever he will and he gives provisions to whom he wills
he is the allknower of everything
so let not the leaders of those who fulfill their covenant with god and the religion of the polytheists and the devoted ones to the way of those who do not know that we are the ignorant
heavy is to idolaters what you invite them to
allah chooses unto himself whomsoever he will and he guideth unto himself whosoever turneth in penitence
and they differed not until after knowledge had come unto them through spite among themselves the evidence had been for a word from your lord the affair would have been decreed between them and they differed
and those who are vouchsafed the book after them are in doubt thereof dubitating
so call them to the holy land and stand with the right and follow not the behests of lust lest you swerve from justice
and say thou verily i believe in that which hath been sent down unto you and i am commanded that should establish justice between you and be a guardian over you
god is our lord and your lord
we are our deeds and to you your deeds
god will gather us together and to him is our returning
those who answered god calls to him will never believe and then disbelieve in him and they will not believe in him and theirs will be a painful torment
god has sent down the book with the truth and the balance
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
they alone know that it is the truth in its words and that they ask you to hasten on
surely those who are in doubt about the hour are wandering far astray
god is kind towards his servants
he gives provisions to whom he wills
he is allpowerful and allmighty
whoever desires the reward of this world we give him of his deeds in order to do with his deeds and whoever desires the reward of this world we give him of it
but they will have no share in the hereafter
or do they have partners in worship with allah who has not permitted
and had it not been for a decisive word gone forth already the matter would have been judged between them
and verily for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers there is a painful torment
and you will see the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers disobedient to allah and you will see the torment of the blazing fire
they shall have whatsoever they will with their lord that is the supreme grace
that is the paradise whereof allah gives glad tidings to his slaves who believe and do righteous good deeds
say i do not ask of you a wage for this except with the lord of all being
whoever does good of his own accord we will give him a greater increase in goodness
god is forgiving and appreciative
or do they say he has forged against god a lie
if god wills he could have sealed your heart
and allah wipes out falsehood and establishes the truth islam by his word this quran
verily he is the allknower of the innermost secrets of the breasts
and he answers the invocation of those who believe and do righteous deeds and he will accept their repentance and he will reward them for their deeds and will reward them in full
he answers the prayers of those who believe and do good deeds and gives them more out of his bounty
and for the disbelievers there is a severe torment
and if allah were to enlarge the provision for his slaves they would surely rebel in the earth but he sends down by measure as he wills verily he is the allseer of everything
he is the allknower the allseer of his slaves
and it is he who sends down the rain after they have despaired and spreads out his mercy
and he is the selfsufficient the praiseworthy
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the crawling things he has scattered abroad in them and he is the allwise
and when he will he is their assembling whensoever he will potent
whatever misfortune befalls you is a promise of what your hands have earned
and he pardons much see the quran verse 3545
and you can not escape in the earth and besides allah you have neither a protector nor any supporter
and among his signs are the ships in the sea like landmarks
if he wills he can calm the winds so the sea surface indeed would have been altering in allahs cause
or he will destroy them because of that which they have earned
and those who dispute not in our signs except in a way of escape from us there is no place for them
whatever thing you have been given is the enjoyment of the present life but what is with your lord is better and more lasting so believe and more lasting
and those who avoid heinous sins and indecencies and when they are wroth forgive
those who keep the prayer established and spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them secretly and openly and repel evil with that which we have provided them secretly and openly and combat evil with good deeds and for them is good
and those who when they take revenge will take it in full
the repayment of a bad action is the same way of fortune
but he who does so will be punished by god
verily he likes not the zalimun oppressors polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and whosoever helps himself after he has been wronged there is no way of blaming him
blame lies on the earth in order that mankind may become arrogant in the land unjustly
these for them there is a painful torment
and indeed whoever patiently endured and forgave – then indeed these are acts of great courage
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there shall be no way
and you will see the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers oppressors etc when they see the torment saying is there any way of return to the worldly life again
you will see them looking at them eyes as if you can see them looking at them with disgrace
and those who believe will say verily the losers are they who lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection
surely the evildoers will be in a lasting chastisement
and they will have no helpers except allah
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there shall be no way
o you will be called towards the holy prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – will be the first time before there comes from allah a day when all the holy qur’an is in the entire world prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
there will be no place of refuge on that day nor will you find a place of refuge from the place of refuge
but if they turn away we have not sent you o muhammad saw as a hafiz protector over them ie takes care of their deeds and to recompense them
your duty is to deliver the message
and when we cause man to taste of mercy from us he rejoices in it but when some man is visited by us he gives them a blind man
and if some evil befalls them as a consequence of their deeds man is surely in despair
and allahs is the dominion of the heavens and the earth
he creates what he wills bestows daughters on whosoever he wills and bestows male offspring upon whom he wills
or he conjoineth them males and females and he maketh barren whomsoever he will verily he is knowing potent
he is allknowing and allpowerful
it is not for any human to speak except by god or a divine revelation that he may reveal something to him or by way he may reveal whatever he wills
verily he was wo nt not to believe in allah the mighty
and thus we have sent unto thee the quran a spirit from our command
you knew not what is the book nor what is faith
but we have indeed sent this quran to a book which we have made this quran a light by which we guide whom we will
and indeed you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him are indeed guiding them to a straight path
the path of god to whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
surely unto god all matters are returned
hamim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
by the clear book
we have indeed sent it this quran down in a clear qur’an that you may understand
and verily it is in the original book with us verily exalted
what shall we hold you prodigal against a people that are a prodigal people
and how many a prophet we sent among the ancients
and never came a messenger to them but they used to mock at him
we destroyed before them the people of the towns of the lout lot
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say the allmighty the allknowing created them
who made the earth a bed for you and laid out tracks upon it so that you may find the way
and we send down water from the sky and with it revived a dead city that was dead
so will you be resurrected
and who hath treated the pairs all of them and appointed for you from ships and cattle things whereon ye ride
and that you may properly mount their backs and may remember your lord ’s favour when you have mounted them and say “ purity is to him who has subjected this to us and has subjected the entire world ”
verily to our lord we are to return
he keeps a watch over his creatures
man is dearly unthankful
or has he taken to himself from what he has created and he has selected for you sons
and when news of a daughter they had reserved for arrahman comes to one of them his face is blackened with shame and he grieves in silence inwardly
is he who is reared amid ornaments and when the time of altercation comes is not to be seen
and they make the angels who are themselves servants of the allmerciful females
what do they witness their creation
their witness shall be written down and they shall be questioned
and they say if the most beneficent allah we would not have worshipped them false deities
they have no knowledge of it they do not know
they only make up lies
or have we given them a book before this to him they are in the doubt
nay but they say we found our fathers following a certain way and religion
and we sent not before thee any township before thee except that we revealed to some of the city and we found our fathers doing it a community and we are their footsteps
he said what think ye can see you if your fathers have gone away from your traces
they said we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent
so we took vengeance on them
so behold what wise hath been the end of those who were warned
and when abraham said to his father and his people i am innocent of what you worship
“ except him who created me and i will guide me ”
and he made it a word enduring among his posterity haply so they would return
nay but i gave them and their fathers enjoyment until the truth has come to them and a manifest messenger
but when the truth came to them from us they said “ this is nothing but pure magic ”
and they said “ why was this not a great man sent down to some man of moment two towns ”
is it they who would portion out the mercy of your lord
and we have preferred some of them above others some of them to whom we have preferred in rank above others that they amass
and had it not been for any people that would have been infidels in order to become a community of strong nation – we would have made them as a mockery until they had remembered and we silver roofs above their houses which they would not have been fearing
and silver doors for their houses and silver couches whereon they recline
and ornaments of gold
all this is only the life of this world
and the hereafter with your lord is for the muttaqun
and whosoever turneth away from the admonition from the most beneficent allah verily he is a wali protector of shaitan satan etc and a helper
and verily they hinder them from the way whilst they deem that they are rightly guided
until when he comes to us he will say to the devil “ alas – if only there were the distance of the east and the west between you and me – and what an evil companion ”
it will profit you not this day o you who turn away from evil deeds and wish to adopt you as a way
so will you make the deaf listen or show the blind and the deaf to the truth or you can not see the truth or who are in open error
we shall take you away from them and then we shall take vengeance on them
or show you what we have promised them
they will have a terrible punishment
so hold you o muhammad saw fast to that which is inspired in you
you are indeed on the straight path
and verily it is an admonition unto thee and an exhortation unto the people of nuh
and ask them o muhammad saw any of the messengers we sent before you appoint aliha gods to be worshipped other than mockery
and indeed we sent moosa with our signs and a clear proof towards firaun and his court members by force injustice to the people of firaun pharaoh and his people
but when he brought them our signs lo they laughed at them
and not a sign we showed them but it was greater than its sister sign and we seized them with chastisement that haply they should return
and they said “ o you magician
and let them not ask for us patiently adhere to it we shall certainly be guided to the way
but when we removed from them the chastisement behold they broke their troth
and firaun pharaoh said o my people
is not the kingdom of egypt and these rivers that flow beneath me
see you not then
or am i not better than this man who is contemptible and can not express himself clearly
why then have bracelets of gold not been set upon him or angels not come with him conjoined
so he made light of the matter to his people and they obeyed him
verily they were a people who were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
so when they angered us we took vengeance on them
and we made them a precedent and an ensample unto those after
and when the son of maryam is cited as an example behold when the disciples grew stiffnecked
and they say are our gods better or he
they can not avail you in the least except as a few
nay but they are a people who behave senselessly
he is purely a bondman of ours whom we have favoured upon and we made him an extraordinary example for the descendants of israel
and if we willed we could have appointed angels born of you in the earth angels walking around their ground with your own souls
he iesa jesus son of maryam mary was a messenger of allah
so fear you god and obey you me
this is a straight path
let not satan misdirect you
verily he is unto you an open enemy
and when isa came with evidences he said verily i have come unto you with wisdom and unto you some of that wherein ye differ
so fear allah keep your duty to him and obey me
surely god is my lord and your lord so worship him
that is allah your lord so worship him alone
this is a straight path
but the factions differed among themselves
woe then unto those who do wrong by ascribing things to iesa jesus that are not true from the torment of a painful day ie the day of resurrection
await they just for the hour that it should come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
friends on that day shall be foes to one another but the godfearing
o my slaves who believe
today no fear shall be on you today nor shall you grieve
and those who are in our signs except those who are lowly
enter paradise you and your wives walking with joy
there will be passed around them platters of gold and cups therein being whatever the souls desire and meat of slaughtered eatable animals milk products fats vegetables fruits etc and fruits etc and fruits etc they will be given to drink
therein you shall have all that you choose
this is the paradise you have been given for an inheritance for what you did
and therein you shall have fruits in plenty of which you shall eat as you have fruits of all kinds
verily the mujrimun criminals sinners disbelievers etc will be in the torment of hell to abide therein forever
it will not decrease for them dumb with despair they will stay in it
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
and they will cry o malik keeper of hell
and verily your lord is not he
he will say verily you shall abide forever
we have indeed brought the truth muhammad saw with the quran to you but most of you have a hatred for the truth
or have they contrived some matter
we too are contriving
or do they think we hear not their secrets and whispers yea we hear not their secrets
yes indeed and our messengers are present with them writing it down
say if arrahman had a son i would have been the first of worshippers
hallowed be the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the throne from that which they ascribe
so leave them alone to plunge and play until they encounter that day of theirs which they are promised
he is god in heaven and god on earth
he is the wise the knower
blessed be he who holds the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and to him you will be returned
and those who call upon apart from him have no power of intercession save those who have borne witness to the truth and who know
and wert thou to ask them who created them they will surely say allah
how then are they deviating
the messenger muhammad saw said o my lord
they are the people who do not believe and say “ peace ”
turn away from them and say peace
again no one but must come to know
hamim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
by the clear book
we have sent it down in a blessed night
verily we we have been sending against him the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
therein is decreed every affair of wisdom
as a favour from us
verily we angels we are messengers of our lord
a mercy from your lord
he is allhearing and allknowing
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you have faith
there is no god but he
he gives life and causes death your lord and the lord of your forefathers
nay but they play in doubt
so wait thou day whereon the heaven will bring forth a manifest smoke
covering the people this is a painful chastisement
that is a grievous affliction
our lord remove from us the torment verily we shall become believers
how can there be for them an admonition when an apostle came to them
but they turned away from him and said a man tutored possessed
we shall remove the punishment from you for a while indeed you will revert
on the day when we shall seize them with a great grip
and indeed before them the people of firaun and an honourable noble messenger came to them
“ and come to me ”
i am for you a faithful messenger
and exalt not yourselves against allah and exalt not yourselves
and i have come to you with a clear authority
and i take refuge in my lord and your lord and your lord lest you should stone me
but if you are in doubt of me then leave me alone
then he called to his lord these are a people guilty
said he depart thou with my bondmen by night
you will be pursued
and leave the sea becalmed they are a drowned host
how many of gardens and springs do they firauns pharaoh people left
and green crops fields etc and goodly places
and favours amongst which they were rejoicing
even so and we shall espouse them to wideeyed houris
and the heavens and the earth wept not over them nor were they respited
and indeed we rescued the descendants of israel from a disgraceful torture
pharaoh said and council pronounce
verily he was of the mufsidun ie those who commit great sins and crimes oppressors tyrants etc
and we chose them and made them a renown lofty
and we gave them signs in which lay clear favours
they said
there is nothing but our first death and we shall not be resurrected
bring back our forefathers if you speak truly
are they better or the people of tubba and those before them whom we destroyed
we destroyed them because they were mujrimun criminals polytheists sinners etc
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for mere play
we created them not save with truth but most of them know not
verily the day of decision is the appointment for all of them
the day when maulan a near relative can not avail maulan a near relative in aught and no help can they receive
except the chosen slaves of allah faithful obedient true believers of islamic monotheism
he is the allmighty the most merciful
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
is the food of the guilty
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
like molten copper bubbling in the belly
seize him and drag him into the depths of hell it will be said
then pour over his head the torment of boiling water
taste
taste you this surely you will be the mighty the noble the most honourable the dignified ”
this is certainly what you had denied
surely the godfearing shall be in a station secure
in gardens and springs
dressed in fine silk and also in thick silk facing each other
thus it is
even so and we shall espouse them to wideeyed houris
therein calling for every fruit secure
they will not taste death therein except the first death
god will protect them from the torment of hell
a bounty from thy lord
that is the supreme achievement
and we have made this qur’an easy in your language for them to understand
so turn away from them
await they just for the hour that it may come upon them
hamim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of the book is from allah the most honourable the all knowing
verily in the heavens and the earth are signs for believers
and in your creation and what he scattered and what he will in the earth of moving creatures are signs for people who are certain
and in the alternation of night and day and in the alternation of night and day and the provision god sends down from the sky and therewith revives the earth after its death indeed in this are signs for people who understand
these are the verses of allah we recite to you o muhammad saw in truth
in what discourse then will they believe testimony
woe to every sinful liar
who hears the verses of allah is recited to him yet persists in denying with arrogance as if he heard them not
so announce to him a painful torment
and when he learns something of our verses this quran he makes them a jest
for such there will be a humiliating torment in the hellfire
and before them is hell and that they will get their torment in the fire and that which they had earned will not be able to defend them from allah
for them there is a great torment
this is a guidance
and those who disbelieve in the signs of their lord theirs shall be a torment afflictive
it is god who sends the breezes that he may sail at his command and he may drive you out of his mercy and that you may seek his bounty and that you may be grateful
and he has subjected to you what is in the heavens and what is in the earth
verily in that is a sign for a people who reflect
say thou unto those who believe let them forgive those who hope not for the days of allah that he may requite those who fear
whosoever worketh righteously it is for his soul and whosoever worketh evil it is only to his own loss
then to your lord you will be made to return
and indeed we gave the children of israel the book and the rule and the prophethood and gave them superiority over others of their time
and we gave them clear signs and proofs in matters of their affairs
and they divided not until after knowledge had come to them through selfish transgression between themselves
verily your lord will judge between them in what they differ
then we have set thee upon a law so follow it and follow not the caprices of those who do not know
verily they can not avail thee at all at all at night except allah
and the unjust are friends one of another god befriends those who fear and follow the straight path
this is a clear insight and evidence for mankind and a guidance and a mercy for people who believe
deem those who commit ill deeds that we shall make them equal in life and death
how bad is the judgement that they make
allah has created the heavens and the earth with reason so that he may reward each soul for what it has earned
and they will not be dealt with unjustly in anything
hast thou seen him who has taken his caprice to be his god and god has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and his heart and his eyes and laid a covering upon their eyes
and who guides not the way except allah
will you not then understand
and they say there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and nothing destroys us except addahr the time
and when our manifest revelations are rehearsed unto them their argument is no other than that they say bring back our dead fathers if ye say sooth
say god gives you life then makes you die then he will gather you to the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt
but most men do not understand
and allahs is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and the day whereon the hour arriveth then they shall lose the followers of falsehood
and thou shalt see every nation hobbling on their knees
and every group enters it curses its sisternation that day there shall be no doubt for that which ye have been working
this our record will speak about you truthfully
verily we were recording what you used to do ie our angels used to record your deeds
and as for those who believed and did good deeds he will admit them into his mercy
that is the evident success
but as for those who disbelieve it will be said did not my verses recited to you but you used to deny them
are you a people who do not believe
and what knowest thou not know that god is the truth and what the hour is assuredly true and what is the sorcery and what knowest thou not we know not whether the hour is near to men and women we know not
none but the purified shall touch
and the evils of their deeds struck them and what they used to mock at surrounded them
and it will be said today we shall forget you even as you forgot the encounter of this your day and your abode is the fire and you will have no helpers
that is because you were trying the life of the world and because the life of the world and the hereafter
so this day no ransom shall be accepted of the fire nor shall they be suffered to make amends
all praise is to allah lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the creation of the heavens and the lord of the earth lord of all the worlds
his is the domination an the heavens and the earth he is the allmighty the allwise
hamim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of the book is from allah the most honourable the all knowing
and we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth and for an appointed term
yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning
say o muhammad saw to these polytheists pagans etc
or have they7 any partnership in the heavens
bring me a book before this or some trace of knowledges if ye say sooth
who is more astray than one who calls apart from god on the day of resurrection and who can not answer them
and when mankind are gathered on the day of resurrection they will become their enemies and deny their worship
and when our clear verses are recited to them the disbelievers say of the truth when it has come to them this is a manifest sorcery
or do they say he has forged it
say if i have fabricated it still you have no power to save me from god
he knows best what you are busy with concerning this
sufficient is he for a witness between me and you
he is the forgiver the merciful
say i am not a new messenger to you nor do i know what is to me or with you i know what is in my knowledge and i only follow what is revealed to me
i only follow what is revealed to me and i am only a clear warner
say have you considered if this quran is from god and a witness from among the children of israel abdullah bin salam testifies that it is that but believe in it and disbelieve in it
and allah guides not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and those who disbelieve say “ it is a qur’an in the muslims ” they say “ it is not in our own good ”
and since they have not taken a son they will say this is an old lie
and before it we have sent down the book and with it as a guidance and a mercy and a mercy and this book is a guidance and a mercy unto the believers
surely those who say our lord is god and then go straight with their caprices nothing to no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
they are the people of paradise abiding in it forever the reward of their deeds
and we have enjoined on man kindness unto parents
his mother bore him with hardship and carrying him with hardship and carrying him with hardship and weaning him is thirty 30 months till when he attains full strength and reaches forty nights
and when he attains to manhood we bestowed on me and my parents and that i may make me one of the righteous rulers in the age of your parents his mother and so that as you admit me to your favour and to such as you allow me
i turn to you in repentance
he said verily i am of those who submit themselves to allah in islam
these are they from whom we accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds verily the dwellers of paradise is a promise which they have been working
they will be among the inmates of paradise a true promise of truth
and he who saith to his father and his mother fie upon you
and the promise of allah is true and the most gracious who says “ will you be raised up after me ”
and they have not done what god has ordained for us
and allah is the best of judges
naught is this but fables of the ancients
they are those upon whom the sentence of punishment has been justified among the previous generations of jinns and men
they are the losers
for all there will be degrees in accordance with that which he hath wrought and they will not be dealt with unjustly
on the day when those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism are exposed to the fire it will be said to them your good deeds in the world and enjoyed them your good and enjoyed them your good and enjoyed them in the life of the
“ and you will be compensated except for your deeds ”
and remember ad when he warned his people in alahqaf the curved sandhills in the southern part of arabian peninsula
i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
they said have you come to turn us away from our gods
then bring us that thou promisest us if indeed thou speakest truly
he said only god has the knowledge
he said “ i preach unto you what i have been sent with and i see you are a foolish people ”
then when they saw it as a sudden cloud coming towards their valleys they said this is a cloud bringing us rain
and they ask you to hasten the punishment before the torment is indeed a terrible torment
destroying everything by the command of its lord
and those cities we destroyed them and their habitations so they made their dwellings as though they were averse
thus do we requite the people who are mujrimun disbelievers polytheists sinners criminals etc
and we had indeed established them in that flourishing condition wherein we had not established you and we had appointed for them hearing and sight and hearts and yet their hearing and sight and hearts and sight and hearts and hearts and hearts understanding them not for ever availed
and assuredly we have destroyed the cities round about you and we have variously propounded our signs that haply they may return
why then did those whom they had taken as gods apart from god not help them
nay but they vanished completely from them when there came the torment
that is because they used to lie and because they used to utter falsehood
and recall what time we turned towards thee a company of jinn towards the jinns hearkening unto the quran when they were in the presence thereof they said listen to it
they said o dhulqarnain
and we sent moses confirming what preceded it the book guidance and confirming what preceded it in the book torah and the gospel of the book after it has been revealed to moses and we have revealed to a straight path
o our people answer god and believe in him and follow the straight path he will forgive you your sins and will save you from a painful doom
and whosoever answereth not allahs summoner he can not frustrate his vengeance on the earth and he shall not weaken the power of god on earth nor shall he weaken the power of god on earth
they wander astray in clear error
do they not realise that allah who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation is able to give life to the dead
yes indeed he is powerful over everything
on the day when those who disbelieve will be exposed to the fire is this not real
they will say yes
he will say then taste the torment for ye have been disbelieving
so be patient as the messengers who were constant in their worship so do not be hasty with them
on the day they see what they had been foretold they will realise that they did not stay in the world except for an hour of the day
this is a message to be delivered
shall any be destroyed except the nation of the sinners
those who disbelieve and bar from gods way and make their deeds go astray because of that they have earned and god will not lead the unbelievers astray the way of god
and those who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and in his messenger muhammad saw and in that which has been sent down to muhammad saw from their lord is the truth and it is the truth from their lord he will expiate their misdeeds from them
that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and those who believe follow the truth from their lord
thus does allah set forth their parables for mankind
when you meet those who disbelieve smite their necks till when you have made a hole in the valley of the captive
then when you have made it obligatory duties enjoined by allah by going to return to them
and had allah willed he would have vindicated himself against them but he ordained fighting in order that he may prove you by that which he hath earned
and those who are slain in the way of allah he will not send their works astray
he will guide them and make good their state
and he will admit them to paradise that he has made known to them
o you who believe
if you help god he will help you and confirm your feet
but as for those who disbelieve he will send their works astray
that is because they detest that which allah hath sent down and so he shall make of noneffect their works
have they not travelled on the earth so that they may behold what wise hath been the end of those before them
god will destroy them by the means of trying them
and for the disbelievers is like the wooden panelling of a wall
that is because allah is the wali protector etc of the believers and that the disbelievers have no wali protector etc denied
god will admit those who believe and do the right into gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
and we have destroyed you in exchange of a greater than these nations than they who were weak and blot or their hands and their refuge will not find for them any helper
is he then who standeth on an evidence from his lord like unto him whose evil way hath been made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it be as he who rightly perceiveth the truth
the description of the paradise which the muttaqun pious see v 22 have been promised underneath it rivers flow therein are rivers of water that is not yet a taste of water from which the fire shall be changed with all kinds of fruits and streams of running water
is this not the two in hell and the water of boiling water to be consumed
and among them are some who listen to you muhammad saw except those who received knowledge from you muhammad saw
those are they whom allah has set a seal on their hearts and they have followed their caprices
and those who attained the right path – allah increases in guidance only their guidance
await they just for the hour that it should come upon them
its tokens have already come
how will it be when their reminder seem good to them
know thou therefore allah there is no god but he and ask forgiveness for your sins and for believing women
and allah knows your moving about and your place of rest in your homes
the believers say why has a sura not been sent down
but when a categorical surah is revealed that mentions war you should see those who were sceptical staring at you like a man in the swoon of death
and he is the allknower of them
obedience is only words answered and the noble messenger
then when the matter is resolved if they had been true to god it would have been better for them
and it is not possible for the sake of allah to cause turmoil in the earth to sever your kinship
those are they whom allah has cursed and has made them deaf and blinded their eyes
or are they on the hearts locks thereof
those who turned back after the guidance had become clear to them and have made them the devil promises them and arouses in them false desires and shaitans satan has not opened their sight
that is because they said to those who disdain what god has revealed we will obey you in part of the matter
how then shall it be when the angels draw out their souls striking at their faces and their backs
that is because they are smitten by that which they replied so that they may know that allah will not send down any good or punished them for their sins and that they did not realise the truth
and allah is ever easy matter
in order to make a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease of hypocrisy and whose hearts is sickness and god will not make them a disease
and if we willed we could surely shew them unto thee so that thou shouldst surely know them by their marks
you will recognise them by their faces by the appearance of the heights will recognise them by their foreheads from the direction of mount sinai
and allah knows your deeds
and we shall assuredly try you until we know the steadfast and those of you who strive hard in the cause of allah and those of you who have patience in the cause of allah and the qiblah prayer direction of prayer and to waste your feet
verily those who disbelieve and hinder others from the way of allah and oppose the messenger saw by standing against him they will not harm them at all hurt allah and he will make their works vain
o you who believe
and obey allah and obey the noble messenger and do not render your deeds void
verily those who disbelieve and hinder others from the way of allah and then die while they are disbelievers allah will not forgive them
so do not become weak against your enemy nor be sad and do not be sad because of what you used to do and allah does not like what you do
the life of this world is nothing but play and pastime
and if you believe and fear allah he will give you your reward and will not require of you your substance
if he asks you for it and presses you you are niggardly and he brings to light your rancour
behold you are those who are called to spend in the cause of allah yet it is you who are niggardly
and whosoever is niggardly is niggardly only to himself
and allah is rich free of all wants and you mankind are poor
if you turn away then god will bring other people as their case he will not replace you even as you are your likes
we have given you a splendent victory
that allah may forgive thee thy former and your fathers have been destroyed by aforetime and guide thee to a straight path
and that allah may help thee with mighty help
it is he who has sent down the faith of faith with faith and he makes it known that the hearts of the believers will never add to their faith to their faith
and to allah belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth and allah is ever knowing wise
that he may admit men and women alike and that he may admit into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein to dwell forever and acquit them of their evil deeds that is with god mighty triumph
and that he may punish the munafiqun hypocrites men and women and the idolaters men and women who think evil thoughts about them and the mushrikun polytheists idolaters pagans idolaters think that allah has cursed them and that allah has cursed them and that allah has prepared for them
and to allah belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth and allah is ever mighty wise
we have sent you as a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
in order that you believe in allah and his noble messenger and honour him and revere him and may say his purity morning and evening
those who swear allegiance to you indeed swear allegiance to god and gods protection is over them
the hand of allah is over their hands
then whosoever breaks his pledge breaks it to his own hurt but whosoever fulfills what he has covenanted with allah he will give him a great reward
those who lagged behind will say to you we were occupied with our flocks and herds and families so ask forgiveness for us
they say with their tongues what is not in their hearts
say who can avail you in the least harm or benefit god in your own selves but who can not help you
in fact allah is aware of what you do
in fact you imagined that the prophet and the faithful would never return to their homes and families prevented us from their homes and you were hiding something when you were in your homes and you were brought forth in your homes
and whosoever believeth not in allah and his apostle then verily we have gotten ready for the infidels a blaze
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
those who lagged behind will presently when ye march forth to take spoils leave us we shall follow you
they wish to change the word of god
say you are not believers
thus allah said even so
they will say nay but you envy us
nay but they understand not except a little
say thou the desert arabs who had asked to fight against a people at fault or you shall have a people who have been given a formidable
there is no blame upon the blind nor is there blame upon the lame nor is there blame upon the sick
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle he will cause him enter gardens whereunder rivers flow as abiders therein and whosoever turneth away him he shall torment with a torment afflictive
indeed allah has sent down upon you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him they were pleased with the believers when they were swearing by allah so he sent down upon you – so he sent down the qur’an upon them and he sent down
and abundant spoils that they will capture
god is allmighty and allwise
allah hath promised you abundant spoils that ye shall take it and hath made it for you and hath appointed for you an enemy and a guidance and a mercy that haply ye may reflect
and other benefits which you have not yet obtained are within your capacity and allah is able to do all things
and had the disbelievers fought you they would have turned their backs and then found neither protector nor helper
this hath been the dispensation of allah with those who passed away aforetime
and thou shalt never find any changing the wo nt of god
and it is he who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of makkah after he had made you victors over them
and allah is allseer of what you do
they are not able to disbelieve and barred you from the holy mosque and the offering detained so as sacrifice
and had it not been for the believing men and believin women whom ye knew not whom ye knew not and that ye might have trampled on them and thus might make mischief on their account unwittingly he had restrained their hands from them and god had not restrained
when those who disbelieve in their hearts were muslims and they were made to appear in their hearts so that they increased in faith and allah sent down his noble messenger and allah sent down hard and his noble messenger upon the muslims
and allah is the allknower of everything
god has indeed fulfilled the vision he showed the vision to his messenger
god will assuredly bring the vision which he will surely bring about the truthful vision if god please in your place of security
he knew what you knew not and he granted besides that a near victory
it is he who has sent his noble messenger with guidance and the religion of truth in order that he may make it islam superior over all other religions –
god suffices as a witness
muhammad is the messenger of allah and the messenger muhammad saw with him is a severe torment
but the unbelievers with him is severe in punishment
you see them kneeling prostrating seeking blessings from god and approval
their mark is on their foreheads from the effect of prostrations
this is their description in the taurat torah and their description in the injeel gospel and their monks is similar to it – that is the freeing of a slave before allah and whatever he wills he sends it down as if he wills it is he who gives
god has promised those who believe and do the right forgiveness and a great reward
o you who believe
do not put yourselves in your houses and god and his messenger
and fear allah
verily allah is hearing knowing
o you who believe
do not raise your voices higher than the voice of the prophet nor speak to him loudly the way you shout loud in one another lest your deeds may be rendered fruitless while you perceive not
verily those who lower their voices in the presence of gods messenger saw they are the ones whose hearts allah has tested for piety
for them is forgiveness and a great reward
and most of them ask you concerning menstruation and go with the people who ask you for judgement about them
and had they been patient until you came out to them it would have surely come out to them
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe
if any miscreant brings you some tidings verify it lest you unknowingly cause suffering to some people and then suffer the consequences thereof
know that allah will see what you are believers and his messenger saw are truly liars
if he obeyed you in the cause of allah you would surely be in trouble but allah has endeared the faith to you in your hearts and has made disbelief to you much of what is in your hearts and he has made disbelief and forgives much good and
they are the rightly guided ones
and allah is ever allknowing allwise
if two groups of believers come to fight one another promote peace between them
and if one of them swerved from them then he will not cease until they stand up to it then if one of them turns again until he had willed he would have avenged himself unless he wills
verily allah loves those who are equitable
o you who believe
and fear allah much abstain from your faith and remember that allah is much perform all kinds of good deeds which he has ordained and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe do not laugh at anyone except a little after a group of you are believers
and they are better than women who likes not waiting
and traduce not one another nor revile one another by odious appellations ill is the name of sin after belief
and whosoever does not repent then those they are the wrongdoers
o you who believe
and avoid much suspicions indeed he is indeed a great deal
o believers eschew much suspicion some suspicion is a sin
and do not spy neither backbite one another would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother
would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother
you would abominate it
and fear allah
verily allah is relenting merciful
o mankind
we have created you male and female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another
surely with god is most equitable in the sight of god
god is allknowing and wellinformed
the desert arabs say we have believed
say you do not believe rather say we surrender for belief has not yet entered your hearts
and say we believe in what is not yet penetrated your hearts
god is forgiving and merciful
the believers are only those who believe in god and his apostle and then fought with their possessions and their selves in the way of god
they are the truthful
say what would you teach god what your religion is in the heavens and the earth god knows what you do not know
they count it as a favour to thee that they have surrendered
say count not your islam as a favour upon me nay but do not favour me with that i created you
verily allah is the allknower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth
and allah is allseer of what you do
qaf
qaf by oath of the glorious qur’an
they were surprised that a warner has come to them from among themselves and they said this is a strange thing
when we are dead and turned to dust and bones how can we be raised again
that is a far returning
we know what the earth consumes of them that preserves everything
in fact they denied the truth when it came to them so they are in an open error
have they not looked at the heaven above them how we have fashioned and adorned it and it has no flaw
and the earth we have stretched it forth and have cast thereon mountains firm and have caused to grow therein of every beauteous kind of plants
an insight and an admonition for every bondman penitent
and we send down water from the sky and we cause the grain to grow grain so those who are almuttaqun the pious see v 22
and tall datepalms with ranged clusters
and tall datepalms with their spathes pile on pile
even so is the coming forth
the people of noah arrass and thamud denied before you
and ad and firaun pharaoh and the brethren of lout lot
and the dwellers in the wood and the people of tubba each one denied the apostles each one denied the messengers so my threat became a reality
what were we wearied by the first creation
nay but they play in doubt
we created man and we know what his soul whispers within him and we are nearer to him than his jugular vein
when the two angels who keep themselves secret together sitting one on the right and one on the left
not a word does he utter but there is a watcher ready to record it
and the stupor of death will come in truth o mankind
this is what you wished to avert
and the trumpet will be blown and so will be blown again be ruined
that is the day of judgement which they will not be able to hide them
and every soul will come with a driver and a witness
you were indeed heedless of this nay but you were among those who are heedless of this
we have been sending against you as a trial for it
and his companion will say here is that with me in that which he hath wrought
cast you twain into gehenna every froward unbeliever
hinderer of good transgressor doubter
who set up another god with god so both of them cast him in the terrible chastisement
cast him ye twain into the torment severe
his companion will say our lord i did not lead him astray in the land
i did not push him to transgress in disbelief oppression and evil deeds but he was himself in error far astray
he will say dispute not before me
the sentence is not changed with me i will not be unjust to my servants
on the day when we will say to hell are you filled with denial
and paradise will be brought near to the muttaqun pious see v 22 not far off
this is the paradise you were promised
verily he was penitent
who fears the most gracious without seeing and came with a heart that inclines
enter therein in peace secure
this is the day of abidence
theirs therein will be whatsoever they list and with us will be yet more
how many a generation we destroyed before them who were fairer in furnishing and outward show
is there not an expanse
verily herein is a reminder unto him who bringeth forth a heart or giveth ear while he is heedful
and we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and fatigue did not even approach us
so bear with patience what they say and proclaim the purity of their lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting
and proclaim his purity during the night and after the customary prayers
and listen attentively on the day when an announcer will proclaim from a place nearby
the day they actually hear the blast will be the day of rising of the dead
that is the day of emergence
verily we it is who give life and cause death and we are to return
on that day the earth will split asunder they will come out hurriedly
this gathering together is easy for us
we know well what they say and you are not a guardian over them
so keep on reminding through the quran whoever fears my warning
by the swift scatterers
and the burdenbearers
and the ships that glide with ease
and by oath of those which carry away –
verily the day of judgement is true
and verily the recompense is sure to happen
by the heaven full of paths
you are only in different opinions regarding this qur’an
turned aside therefrom is who is turned aside
perish the conjecturers
who dissimulate
they ask when will be the day of recompense
the day they will be burnt in the fire
taste your trial
this is what you were trying to hasten
verily the godfearing will be in a station secure
verily those who hold what they have given their lord and fear him
they used to sleep only a little during the night
and in the dawns they prayed for forgiveness
and in their properties there was the right of the beggar and non beggar
and in the earth are signs for those who do not believe
and in the earth are signs for those who believe
do you not see that whatever is in heaven and the earth has been promised you and its fruits are twice over you
and in the heaven is your provision and that you are promised
by the lord of the heaven and the earth is certainly true as you do
hast thou received the story of moses
when they came to him and said peace he answered peace
then he turned to his household and brought a fattened calf
and he set it before them and said wherefore eat ye not
then he conceived a fear of them
they said fear not and they gave him glad tidings of a youth knowing
his wife came forward and turned it away from him and said how shall i have a son
they said even so says your lord
he is the wise the knower
he said what is your errand sent ones
they said we have been sent to a people who are mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disbelievers in allah
