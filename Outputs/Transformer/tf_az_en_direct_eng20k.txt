we created you from a male and female and made you races and tribes that you may know one another
indeed the noblest of you in the sight of allah is the most godfearing of you
allah is allknowing allaware
the bedouins say “ we believe ”
say you do not believe but say ‘ we have submitted ’
if you obey allah and his messenger he will not stint anything against you
allah is forgiving merciful
the believers are only those who believe in allah and his messenger and afterward doubt not their wealth and their lives in the way of allah and their lives
these are the truthful
say would you teach god what is in your religion god knows everything in the heavens and the earth and god is cognisant of everything
they count it as a favour to you that they have submitted
say do not count your embracing of islam as a favour to me
nay but allah hath conferred a favour unto you inasmuch as he hath guided you to belief if ye are true believers
indeed allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth
and allah is allseer of what you do
qaf
by the glorious qur an
nay but they marvel that a warner has come to them from among themselves and the unbelievers say this is a marvelous thing
what when we are dead and become dust shall we be brought forth
that is a farfetched return ’
we know what the earth diminishes of them and with us is a book recording
nay but they belied the truth when it came unto them so they are in a state of confusion
have they not observed the heaven above them how we have built it and beautified it and there are no cracks in it
and we spread out the earth and cast firm mountains and we caused to grow therein of every kind of plant
a lesson and an insight
and we send down from the sky water rain and we produce gardens and grain which grow in it grains
and tall palmtrees with compact spathes
a provision for the bondmen and therewith we revived a dead land
even so is the coming forth of human beings
before them the people of noah denied the truth and so did the people of rass and thamud
and ad and pharaoh and the brethren of lot
the dwellers of the thicket and the people of tubba every one denied the messengers so my threat became due against them
were we exhausted by the first creation
nay but they are in doubt about a new creation
we have created man and we know what his soul whispers in him and we are nearer to him than his jugular vein
when the two receivers receive seated on one on the right and one on the left
he uttereth no word but there is a vigilant watcher ready to him
and the stupor of death will come in truth this is what you had sought to shun
and the trumpet is blown
this is the day of retribution
and every soul will come with a driver and a witness
“ you were heedless of this so we removed your veil and your vision is keen ”
his companion will say this is what i have ready with me
and it will be said to the two angels “ cast into hell every stubborn disbeliever
hinderer of good transgressor doubter
who set up another god with god toss him into the intense agony of punishment
his companion will say “ our lord i did not cause him to rebel against himself ”
he will say “ do not feud in my presence i had already warned you in advance
the word of judgement is not changed and i am not unjust to the servants ’
on the day when we will say to hell “ are you full ” and it will say “ are there any more ”
and paradise will be brought near to the godfearing and will not be far removed from them
this is what you were promised for every penitent
who fears the most gracious without seeing and came with a heart that inclines
enter it in peace
this is the day of eternity ”
therein for them there is all that they desire and with us is more
how many generations we have destroyed before them who were mightier than they and they traversed the cities there is no escape
surely in that is a lesson for he who possesses a heart or is heedful
we created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and no fatigue touched us
so bear with patience what they say and sing the praises of your lord before the rising of the sun and before sunset
and glorify him in the night and after the prostrations
and listen on the day when the caller calls from a nearby place
the day when they will hear the shout in truth they will hear the shout of the truth
that is the day of coming forth from the graves
it is we who give life and cause death and to us is the destination
on the day when the earth is split for them they will come out hastening out to hasten out from the earth and the day of gathering will be brought out for us
we are best aware of what they say and you are not required to force them
so admonish by the quran whosoever fears my threat
by the spreaders spreading
and those that bear the burden of rain
and those that glide with ease
and those distributing as it is a provision of the slaves
surely what you are promised is true
and the judgement will doubtlessly take place
by the heaven full of paths
you are in different opinions regarding the fact
and who is turned away from it
perish the liars
who are dazed in perplexity
they ask when is the day of recompense
it will be the day when they will be scourged by the fire
taste your trial
this is what you were trying to hasten ”
verily the godfearing shall be amid gardens and springs
taking what their lord will vouchsafe unto hem
they were before this
they slept little at night
and in the morning they would ask forgiveness
and in their wealth there was a share for the beggar and the deprived
and in the earth are signs for those who are certain
and also in your ownselves
will you then not see
and in heaven is your provision and that which ye are promised
by the lord of the heaven and the earth it is the truth as you speak
has the story of abraham s honoured guests reached you
when they came to him they said peace he said peace you are a people unknown to me
then he turned to his family and brought a fatted calf
and placing it before them saying will ye not eat
then he conceived a fear of them
they said fear not and announced to him the good news of a boy endowed
so his wife came screaming and smote her face and said “ an old woman barren old woman ”
they said “ your lord has said he is the wise the knowing ”
he said “ what is your business o messengers ”
they said we have been sent to a guilty people
that we may unleash upon them stones of clay
marked by your lord for the transgressors
so we brought out of it the believers
but we found not therein except one house of muslims
and we left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
and in moses too there is a sign when we sent him to pharaoh with clear authority
but he turned away showing his back and said a sorcerer or a madman
so we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea and he was reproachable
and in ad also is a lesson when we sent against them the barren wind
it spared nothing that it left nothing but blew it into scattered
and in thamood when it was said to them “ enjoy yourselves for a while ”
but they rebelled against their lord s command ’ so they became haughty and they were looking on
they were unable to stand up nor could they help themselves
and before them the people of noah they were a wicked people
we built the heaven with might and we extend it with power
and the earth we spread it out and how excellent spreaders we have stretched it forth
and we created all things in pairs so that you may take admonition
so flee to allah
i am a clear warner to you from him
and do not set up another god with god
i am to you a clear warner ”
likewise no messenger came to those before them but they said a sorcerer or a madman
have they bequeathed it to one another
nay but they are a people transgressing beyond bounds
so turn away from them you are not blameworthy
and remind for the reminder benefits the believers
i created the jinn and humankind only that they may worship me
i desire no sustenance from them nor do i want them to feed me
verily allah is allah the provider owner of power the mighty
and the wrongdoers will have a portion of the life of the world and let them taste a painful punishment
woe to the faithless for what they were promised
by the mount sinai
and by oath of the book
in a parchment unrolled
by the house frequented
and the roof uplifted
and the sea
verily the torment of your lord is about to come
there is none that can avert it
the day when the sky will tremble with a visible shaking
and the mountains move away with awful movement
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
who play in talk
on the day when they are shoved forcibly towards the fire of hell will be told “ enter
this is the fire which you used to deny
is this magic or is it you do not see
enter it or whether you are patient it will be the same for you whether you are patient or impatient it is all with patience
you are only being requited for what you used to do ’
indeed the pious are in gardens and springs
rejoicing in what their lord has given them and their lord will guard them against the chastisement of the fire
eat and drink with relish for what you used to do
reclining on couches ranged in rows and we shall couple them with gorgeous eyes
and those who believe and whose progeny followed them in faith we shall unite them with their offspring and we shall not deprive them of anything of their deeds
every man is hostage to what he has earned
and we shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire
they will pass therein to pleasantry or sin
and there shall go round unto them youths as if they were hidden pearls
and they will approach one another inquiring
they will say “ before this we were in fear of our families
but allah has been gracious to us and has protected us from the punishment of the blazing fire
we used to pray to him erstwhile
he is the most merciful the most merciful
so admonish them by the grace of your lord you are neither a soothsayer nor a madman
or do they say he is a poet for whom we await for you an adverse turn of fortune
say wait i too am waiting with you
or do their minds command them to this or are they a people immersed in transgression
or do they say he has invented it
nay but they will not believe
let them bring a discourse like it if they are truthful
or were they created out of nothing or were they created
or did they create the heavens and the earth
nay but they are not certain
or do they own your lord s treasures ’
or are they the controllers
or do they have a stairway into heaven whereby they eavesdrop
then let their listener produce a manifest proof
or has he daughters and you sons
or askest thou muhammad a hire from them so that they are laden with debt
or is it they in the unseen and so they write it down
or do they intend to be a plot against you o muhammad saw
but those who disbelieve will be plotted against the stratagem
or do they have a god other than allah
glorified be allah from all that they ascribe as partner unto him
and if they see a fragment of the sky falling down they would say ‘ a cloud ’
so leave them till they encounter their day in which they will be thunderstruck
the day when their guile will avail them nothing and they will not be helped
and indeed for the wrongdoers there is a punishment besides that but most of them do not know
and wait for your lord for you are before our eyes
and proclaim the praise of your lord when you rise
and glorify him in the night and at the declining of the stars
by the star when it sets
your companion has neither gone astray nor amiss
nor does he speak out of his own desire
it is naught but a revelation revealed
taught by the extremely powerful
dhu <unk> he stood poised
and he was on the horizon
then he drew near and hung above suspended
until he was two bows length or even nearer
then he revealed to his servant what he revealed
his heart did not know what it saw
will you dispute with him concerning what he saw
and indeed he saw him in another descent
by the lotetree of the boundary
near which is the garden of abode
when the lotetree was covered over with what covered it
the sight of his eye turned not aside nor did it stray
he saw some of the greatest signs of his lord
have you considered lat and uzza
and manat the third one the other
are you the males and he females
that is indeed an unjust division
they are but names which you have named you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority but they follow not except guesses and they follow the guidance from their lord and the right way
or is man that he wishes
to allah belongs the last and the first
how many a angels whose intercession will not avail in the heavens and the earth after allah permits whomsoever he wills
those who do not believe in the hereafter give the angels the names of females
they have no knowledge of it they follow but assumptions and assumptions do not follow their opinion
so withdraw from him who turns away from our remembrance and desires nothing but the life of this world
that is the extent of their knowledge
your lord knows best who has strayed from his path and he knows best who are guided
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth that he may requite those who do evil with the recompense of what they did
those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations save the <unk> offences
your lord is the forgiver possessor of mercy
it is he who created you from the earth and since you were foetuses in your mothers wombs
he is the best knower of him who fears allah
have you considered him who turns away
and gave a little and held back
can he possess the knowledge of the unseen so that he can foresee
or has he not been told of what is in the scrolls of moses
and abraham who fulfilled his debt
that no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another
and that man shall have nothing but what he strove for
and that his endeavour shall be seen
then he will be repaid for it with fullest payment
and that to your lord is the finality
and that it is he who causes laughter and weeping
and that it is he who causes death and life
and that he it is who created the two kinds pairs male and female
from a drop of liquid when it is emitted
and that upon him is the next existence
and that it is he who enricheth and preserveth wealth
and that it is he who is the lord of sirius
and that it is he who destroyed the former
and thamood sparing no one
and before that they were the people of noah aforetime they were more unjust and more rebellious
and he overthrew the cities of sodom
so they were covered with whatever covered them
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye doubt
this is a warner of the warners of old
the imminent hour is near
none can avert it except allah
will you then wonder at this discourse
and laugh and do not weep
while you are heedless
so prostrate yourselves before allah and worship him
the hour has drawn near and the moon has drawn near
and if they see a sign they turn away and say “ this is magic ”
they denied the truth and followed their own desires
and every matter is determined by it
and assuredly there hath come unto them tidings of the <unk>
wisdom consummate wisdom but warnings avail not
so turn away from them
the day when the caller calls to a dire thing
they will come out with humbled look from the graves as if they were scattered locusts
scrambling toward the summoner the disbelievers will be cast into the fire and the disbelievers will say this is a hard day
before them the people of noah denied the truth and said “ he is a madman ”
so he prayed to his lord “ i am vanquished therefore avenge me ”
so we opened the gates of heaven with water pouring down
and we caused the earth to gush forth with springs so that the waters met for a predestined decree
and we bore him on a craft of planks and nails
sailing under our eyes a reward for him who was rejected
and we left it as a sign but is there any that will remember or receive admonition
so how were my punishment and my warnings
and we have made the qur an easy to remember is there any that will remember or receive admonition
the ad gave the lie to hud so how terrible was my chastisement and my warnings
we unleashed upon them a screaming wind on a day of unrelenting misery
which snatched away men as if they were trunks of uprooted palmtrees
so how were my punishment and my warnings
and we have made the qur an easy to remember is there any that will remember or receive admonition
the tribe of thamud rejected warnings
they said ‘ will we follow one who is a lone magic from among us
then indeed we would go astray and insane
is there not a reminder to him alone among us
nay he is a selfconceited liar ’
tomorrow they will know who is the impudent liar
we shall try them for a hundred years and we shall watch them for their patience
and inform them that the water is to be shared between them each pursuing them each and they turn in repentance
but they called their comrade and he took hold of them and hamstrung her
so how were my punishment and my warnings
we sent against them a single scream and they became like the dry sticks of a dry sticks
and we have made the qur an easy to remember is there any that will remember or receive admonition
the people of lot rejected the warnings
we sent a rain upon them we loosed against them except the family of lot whom we rescued in the morning
as a favour from us
thus do we reward the thankful
he had warned them of our onslaught but they dismissed the warnings
they lusted after his guests so we obliterated their eyes saying taste my punishment and my warnings
and indeed the morning seized them early morning
so taste my punishment and my warnings
and we have made the qur an easy to remember is there any that will remember or receive admonition
and indeed the noble messengers came to pharaoh s people ’
they denied our signs all of them so we seized them with the seizing of the mighty the powerful
are your disbelievers better than they or have you been granted exemption from them
or do they say we are a congregation victorious
the multitude will soon turn their backs and flee
nay but the hour is their tryst and the hour will be more calamitous and bitter
indeed the guilty are in error and madness
the day when they are dragged on their faces into the fire they will be told “ taste the touch of saqar ”
we have created everything in a measure
and our command is but one word like the flashing of an eye
we have destroyed your likes so is there any that will remember
all things they have done is in the books
and everything small and great sin
indeed the pious will dwell amid gardens and springs
in a seat of truthfulness and honour
the merciful one
has taught the qur an
he created man
he taught him eloquent speech
the sun and the moon are set in a reckoning
and the herb and the trees prostrate themselves
and the sky he has set up the balance
transgress not in the balance
and observe correct measure weigh with justice and do not cheat the balance
and the earth he set up the creatures
in which are fruits and datepalms and pomegranates
grain and grain in the blade
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
he created man from fermented clay dried tingling hard
and created the jinn from the flame of fire
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
lord of the two easts and lord of the two wests
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
he has let loose the two seas that meet together
between them is a barrier which they do not overstep
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
pearls and coralstone come out from them
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
his are the ships that run raised up in the sea like mountains
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
everyone on it is ephemeral
but abiding there remaineth the countenance of your lord of majesty and beneficence
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth entreat him for him
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
we shall surely aim o you o prominent enmity and <unk>
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
if you are able to pass the owners of the heavens and the earth then pass through them
but you will not pass through except with authorization
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
flames of fire and molten copper will be loosed against you and you will not be able to defend yourselves
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
when the sky is rent asunder and becomes like a rose
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
on that day no man shall be questioned about his sin nor any intercessor
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
the guilty will be known by their marks and will be seized by their forelocks and their feet
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
this is the hell which the sinners belied
they will go round between it and between it and boiling water
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
and for him who fears the standing before his lord there are two gardens
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
abounding in branches
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
in them are two flowing springs
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
in them are fruits of every kind of fruit
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
reclining upon couches lined with brocade and the fruits of the two gardens will be near at hand
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
in them are maidens restraining their glances untouched before them
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
as though they were rubies and corals
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
is the requital of goodness anything but goodness
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
and besides these two there are other gardens
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
dark green
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
in them are two gushing springs
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
in them are fruits and datepalms and pomegranates
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
in them are good and beautiful
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
houris cloistered in pavilions
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
neither human nor jinn have touched them before
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
reclining on green cushions and lovely carpets
which then of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie
blessed be the name of your lord the majestic the munificent
when the terror descends
there is no denying that it will befall
abasing exalting
when the earth is shaken with a shock
and the mountains are crushed
so they will become like fine dust scattered
you will be three classes
and those on the right how happy are those on the right hand
and those on the left how miserable will be the people on the left
and the outstrippers the outstrippers
those are they who will be nearstationed to their lord
in the gardens of delight
a multitude of those foremost will be from the first generations who embraced islam
and a few of later time
on couches wrought in gold
reclining on them facing one another
immortal youths shall go about them
with goblets and ewers and a cup of limpid drink
wherefrom they will neither die nor intoxicate
and fruits of their choice
and meat of birds that they desire
and gorgeous eyed fair ones
like hidden pearls
a recompense for what they used to do
therein they shall hear no idle talk no cause of sin
but only the greeting peace peace peace
and those on the right how – fortunate are those on the right
among thornless lotetrees
and clustered plantains
and extended shade
and water everflowing
and fruit in plenty
unfailing unforbidden
and uplifted mattresses
we have created them maidens of special creation
and made them virgins
loving companions matched in age
for the people of the right hand
a multitude of those foremost will be from the earlier generations
and a multitude of later time
and those on the left how – wretched are those on the left
amid searing wind and scalding water
and a shade of thick pitchblack smoke
neither cool nor pleasant
they were before this
and they used to persist in the great sin
and they used to say when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we then be raised again
and also our forefathers
say the ancients and the later generations
will be gathered together to the tryst of a known day
then you the erring the deniers
you will eat of the tree of zaqqum
and stuff your bellies with it
and drink boiling water on top of it
drinking like thirsty camels drink
that is their hospitality on the day of retribution
it is we who created you so why do you not believe
have you considered the seed you thought
is it you who create it or are we the creator
we have decreed death among you and we are not to be frustrated
he will replace you with others and will replace you with others like you in full of which you do not know
you have known the first creation so why do you not reflect
have you considered the seeds you till
is it you who make it grow or are we the grower
if we will we can make it chaff then you will lament
saying we are laden with debts
nay but we are deprived
have you considered the water you drink
is it you who bring it down from the clouds or are we the sender down
if we will we could make it bitter so why do you not give thanks
have you considered the fire you kindle
is it you who made its tree grow or are we the grower
we made it a reminder and a provision for the traveler
so glorify the name of your lord the allsupreme
i swear by the fallings of the stars
and that is indeed a mighty oath if you but knew
this is indeed a noble qur an ’
in a book protected from tampering
which none can touch except the purified
a revelation from the lord of the worlds
is it this discourse that ye take lightly
and make it your livelihood to deny it
so why is it not when the soul reaches up to the throat
and you are looking on
we are nearer to him than you but you do not see
why then if you are not revived
do you not bring back to life if you are truthful
then if he is one of those brought nigh
then happiness and flowers and gardens of delight
and if he is one of those on the right
then peace be upon you from those on the right hand
but if he is one of the deniers
then a welcome of inferno
and roasting in hell
this is the truth
so glorify the name of your lord the allsupreme
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols allah and he is the mighty the wise
his is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
he it is who gives life and causes death and he is able to do all things
he is the first and the last and the outward and the inward and he is the knower of all things
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days then settled on the throne
he knows whatever enters the earth and whatever emerges from it and whatever emerges from it and whatever descends from the sky and whatever ascends to it
and allah is allseer of what you do
his is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
to allah all matters are returned
he merges the night into the day and he merges the day into the night and he knows what is in the breasts
believe in allah and his messenger and spend of that which he has made you successors
and those of you who believe and spend in the way of allah theirs shall be a great reward
what is the matter with you that you do not believe in god when the messenger calls you to believe in your lord and he has taken a covenant with you if you are believers
it is he who sends down clear verses to his servant so that he brings you out of darkness into light
indeed allah is to you most merciful
what is the matter with you that you spend in the way of allah when to allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth
those of you who spent before their wealth and children are not equal before the other
they are those who spent their wealth in the way of allah after the persecution is more worthy to be fought
but allah has promised the best reward
and allah is allaware of what you do
who is he that will lend allah a goodly loan so that he may multiply it for him and his will be a generous wage
on the day when you see the believing men and believing women their light radiating ahead of them and their light will be told “ today you are allowed to live for them gardens beneath which rivers flow beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein eternally
that is the supreme triumph
on the day when the hypocrites men and women will say to the believers wait for us that we may borrow from your light
it will be said go back and seek light for you
then a wall will be erected between them with a gate of inward overhanging mercy and a gate will be erected
they will call out to them will say were we not with you
but you tempted you temptations into temptations into temptations and you tempted your wives and you doubted and you doubted and you doubted
allah has not ever deceived you in respect of any matter of satan and he protects you concerning the unseen
so today no ransom will be accepted from you nor from those who disbelieved
your refuge is the fire
it is he who has made you taste it and worst indeed is that destination
is it not time that the hearts of those who believe should be humbled to the remembrance of allah and that the truth has come down to you and that they may not be like those who were given the book before they were given the book
and many of them were wrongdoers so long as they were guided
know that allah revives the earth after it has died
we have made clear to you the signs haply you will understand
verily those who spend their wealth and children are lending for allah s cause and those who lend it a goodly loan to allah and theirs shall be a generous reward
those who believe in allah and his messenger and are the sincere to their lord they are the truthful
they have their guerdon and their light
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our signs they are the companions of the blaze
know that the life of this world is nothing but play and diversion and adornment and boasting among you with wealth and children and rivalry in wealth and children
then it withers and you see it yellowing then it becomes chaff in the life of this world and in the hereafter and in the hereafter is forgiveness and a severe punishment
the life of this world is nothing but delusion
race with forgiveness from your lord and a garden whereof the width of the heavens and the earth gotten ready for those who believe in allah and his messengers and his messengers
that is the grace of allah which he bestows on whom he will of his mercy
no affliction befalls you in the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the book before we bring it back in the book before we bring it back in the book
so that you may not grieve over what escapes you nor rejoice in what has come to you
allah does not love the proud and the braggart
who are miserly and enjoin upon others and who are stingy
and whosoever turns away from allah and his messenger he is the rich the praised
and indeed we sent our messengers with clear proofs and sent down with them the book and the balance that mankind may be charged with justice
we sent down iron wherein is great benefits and that which is in the breasts of men and that god may know him who helps him in the unseen and his messengers
indeed allah is allstrong allmighty
and assuredly we sent nuh and ibrahim and ibrahim and ibrahim and his progeny and the scripture and verily therein is a guide of their creation and many of them are transgressors
then we sent our messengers in their footsteps and we sent our messengers and we sent following jesus son of mary and we caused the evangel to change the hearts of those who followed him
and we followed him tenderness and mercy from them they invented it was not allowed to follow their desires
but they did not observe it with the observance of allah and they did not observe it
so we gave those of them who believed their wage and many of them are transgressors
o you who believe fear allah and his messenger and believe in his messenger muhammad saw and he will give you a light of his mercy and allah will appoint for you a light by his mercy and allah is ever forgiving merciful
so that the people of the book may know that they have no control over the favor of allah and that allah gives to whom he wills of his bounty and that allah is dispenser of a mighty grace
allah has heard the statement of her husband who pleads with you concerning her husband and complains to allah
verlly allah is hearing beholding
those of you who divorce their wives by pronouncing zihar they are not their mothers
their mothers are only those who gave birth to them
they say what is evil and a blatant lie
allah is pardoning and forgiving
those who repudiate their wives by pronouncing zihar and thereafter they shall free a slave before they touch one another
that is what you are admonished and god is aware of what you do
he who can not afford to fast for a slave before they touch each other and he who is unable to do so for him who is unable to do so
that is in order that you may believe in allah and his messenger and these are the ordinances of allah
and for the unbelievers there is a painful punishment
those who oppose allah and his messenger will be subdued as those before them were subdued
we have sent down clear signs
and for the unbelievers there is a humiliating punishment
on the day when allah will raise them all together then inform them of what they did
allah has kept account of it while they have forgotten it and allah is witness over all things
have you not seen that allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
there is no whispering of three among three but he is their fourth nor among five but he is their sixth nor fewer nor any more but he is with them wheresoever they may be
then on the day of resurrection he will inform them of what they used to do
allah is knower indulgent
have you not seen those who were forbidden to conspire together after they were forbidden to talk secretly and enmity and disobedience to the messenger of the messenger and to the messenger of allah
and when they come to you they greet you with a greeting for allah does not greet you with and say ‘ why does allah punish us for what we say ’
hell will suffice them and it is an evil destination
o believers when you converse secretly together in sin and transgression and disobedience to the messenger and piety and fear god and fear him you shall be mustered
conspiring secretly together maliciously in secret talks secret intentions and that he may cause those who believe to believe but he can not harm them at all except by the leave of allah
in allah let the believers put their trust
o believers when you are told to make room in the assemblies then make room allah will give you the earth
and when it is said to you rise up rise up allah is the knower of those who believe and those who believe
and allah is allaware of what you do
o believers when you converse privately with the messenger offer charity before your private talk
that is better for you and purer
but if you find nothing to offer the charity then know that allah is forgiving merciful
are you afraid of spending before your private talks before you consult
but if you do it not and allah will give you his due compensation and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and obey allah and his messenger
and allah is allaware of what you do
have you not seen those who take for friends a people whom allah is wrathful
they are neither of you nor of them they swear to a falsehood and they swear to a falsehood
allah has prepared for them a severe punishment
evil is what they used to do
they have taken their oaths as a shield and bar from the way of allah so for them is a humiliating punishment
their wealth and children will not avail them anything against allah
they are the people of the fire and they will abide therein forever
on the day when allah will raise them all together they will swear before him as they swear to you thinking that they will be on a wide position
lo it is they who are the liars
satan has overpowered them and has caused them to forget the remembrance of allah
they are the party of satan
lo it is the devil s band that will be the losers
those who oppose god and his messenger will be among the lowliest
allah has written “ i will prevail i and my messengers ”
indeed allah is allstrong allmighty
o prophet you who believe in allah and the last day loving those who oppose allah and his messenger and the last day even though they be their fathers their brothers or their clan or their sons or their brothers sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or
he has inscribed faith in their hearts and strengthened them with ruh jibrael gabriel from him and he has made guidance to them
allah will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow where they will abide forever
allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with him
lo it is they who are the party of allah the party of the party ofallah
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols allah and he is the mighty the wise
it is he who expelled the people of the book from their homes from you expelled from their homes from their homes and they assumed that they would not have fought except by the leave of allah and they thought that they could not be able to defend themselves
and if allah had not decreed banishment for them he would have punished them in this world and in the hereafter there is a torment for them in this world
that is because they opposed allah and his messenger
and whosoever opposes allah then verily allah is severe in retribution
whatever you cut down or left standing on the roots of allah s roots it is by the enemy of allah and that he might disgrace the transgressors
and whatever spoils of war booty you gave from them their treasure as spoils of war allah gives them whatever spoils of his messenger and allah is able to do all things
whatever spoils of war booty allah gives to his messenger to the people of the townships which allah has bestowed upon his messenger and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the orphans and the needy and the traveller do not be a rich among you
whatever the messenger gives you accept it and refrain from whatever he forbids you
indeed allah is severe in retribution
the spoils of their homes who were expelled from their homes and their possessions and their lives and protection from allah and his messenger and help allah and his messenger these are the truthful
and those who had settled in the city before them and seek refuge in the cause of allah and in his messenger and do not find any privation for what is given them and preferring them above themselves what they have been given to earn
and whosoever is protected from his own covetousness such are the successful
and those who came after them saying our lord forgive us and those who believed before us and our brethren who have faith in the past and forgive our lord you are the gentle the merciful
have you not considered the hypocrites say to the people of the book who disbelieve if you are expelled we will surely go out with you and we will not fight you in the least against you they will surely go back to fight you and if you are
but god is witness over their lying
and if they are expelled they will not go with them and if they are fought against them they will not help them
if they help them they will turn their backs and flee then they will not be helped
indeed you fear their hearts are more awful in their breasts
that is because they are a people who do not understand
they will not fight you in fortified cities except in fortified cities or from behind walls
their hostility is great among themselves
you think they are united but their hearts are divided
that is because they are a people who do not understand
they are like those who tasted the evil result of their deeds and theirs will be a painful punishment
like satan when he says to man ‘ disbelieve ’ he says ‘ i am absolved of what he says ‘ ’
but when the human being disbelieved he said i am quit of you
i fear allah the lord of the worlds
so the fate of both will be in the fire where they will abide for ever
such is the recompense of the wrongdoers
o you who believe
and let every soul consider what it sendeth forward for tomorrow and fear allah
allah is aware of what you do
and be not like those who forgot allah so he caused them to forget their ownselves
these are the transgressors
not equal are the inhabitants of the fire and the inhabitants of paradise
the inhabitants of paradise they are the triumphant
had we sent down this quran upon a mountain you would have seen it humbled to the fear of allah
we propound such as they draw comparisons for mankind so that they may reflect
he is allah there is no god but he the knower of the unseen and the seen
he is the merciful the most merciful
he is allah there is no god except he the sovereign the holy the holy the giver of peace the holy the holy the holy the giver of peace the holy the majestic the compeller the supreme
high is allah from all that they associate
he is allah the creator the maker the fashioner
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols him
he is the mighty the wise
and do not befriend my enemies nor enemies for them while they deny the truth has come to you from my enemies
and you have believed in allah and his messenger and if you have fought for the sake of allah they have departed from my messenger and your lord
you will certainly find friendship with them secretly and i will make whatever you reveal and what you reveal
and whosoever of you does that he should go astray surely he is far astray
if they gain dominance over you they will be your enemies and stretch out their hands and their tongues to you with evil designs and evil
neither your relatives nor your children will avail you on the day of resurrection allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection
and allah is allseer of what you do
and when abraham and his people are with him in the ark and when they said to you we are quit of you and our father and your people for you we believe in allah and his messenger abraham said we are quit of you and our lord in
our lord forgive us not o lord and forgive us our sins and our lord thou art the mighty the wise
you have a good example for him who hopes for you and the last day
and whosoever turns away then verily allah is selfsufficient immensely praiseworthy
it may be that allah will ordain between you and those of them who are near to those who associate others with you
allah is ever forgiving merciful
allah forbiddeth you not those who warred against you with faith and expelled you from your homes and did not drive you out of your homes
allah loves those who deal with equity
allah only forbids you from those who fought against you in religion s way and expelled you from your homes and aided you with grief and driving you out of grief
and whosoever takes them for friends these are the wrongdoers
o believers when believing women come to you as emigrants examine them
allah is the best knower of their faith
and if you know them to be true to women they are not lawful to the faithless
and give them what they have spent upon them
there is no fault in you if you marry them their wives
and hold not to the disbelievers in that which ye have spent and ask what they have spent as mahr as mahr for the disbelievers and let them ask for that which they have spent
that is allah s judgement he rules between you
allah is allknowing allwise
and if any of your wives desert you to go away from the unbelievers and the unbelievers have left their wives and the last of the unbelievers have spent then they have spent as dowries
and fear allah in whom you believe
o prophet when believing women come to you swearing fealty to allah and that they will not associate anything with allah nor steal nor steal nor commit adultery nor commit adultery nor commit any thing that they shall bring any thing to you in their hands to accept their
allah is forgiving merciful
o you who believe take not a friends of allah for friends
indeed they have despaired of the faithless so they do not have any hope in the hereafter
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols allah and he is the mighty the wise
o you who believe why do you profess what you do not practise
it is most hateful to allah that you should say what you do not do
allah loveth those who fight in his way as if they were a solid wall cemented with molten lead
and when moses said to his people why do you hurt me when i am god s messenger to you why do you know me when you know me
so when they deviated they turned away
and allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
and when jesus son of mary said o children of israel i am the messenger of allah to you confirming what is revealed before me and give good tidings of a messenger whose name is ahmad
but when he brought them manifest proofs they said this is magic manifest sorcery
and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against allah when he is called to islam
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
they desire to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah will extinguish his light even though the disbelievers get annoyed
it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that he may uplift it above all religions even though the idolaters dislike it
o you who believe shall i direct you to a commerce that will save you from a painful punishment
believe in allah and his messenger and strive in the cause of allah with your wealth and lives
that is better for you if you only knew
he will forgive you your sins and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow
that is the supreme success
and he gave you from other than that which is good and good in this world and a near victory
the disciples said who is my helpers of allah the disciples said to the disciples who are my helpers in allah s cause we are the helpers of allah
then a section of the children of israel believed while a section disbelieved
so we strengthened those who believed against their foe so they became triumphant
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols allah the sovereign the holy prophet ibrahim the holy qur an ’ and the holy prophet peace be upon him is the exalted in might the wise
it is he who has sent among the unlettered people a messenger from themselves reciting to them his verses and purifying them and teaching them the book and wisdom although before that they were in obvious error
and he has chosen them who have not yet joined them and he is the most honourable the wise
that is the grace of allah he vouchsafeth it on whomsoever he will and allah is of infinite bounty abounding
the likeness of those who were entrusted with the torah and then did not carry it is as the likeness of a donkey carrying books
evil is the likeness of the people who deny the revelations of allah
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
say o you who are judaised if you claim to be the favourites of allah you pretend to be truthful for death if you are truthful
but they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent ahead
allah is well aware of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
say “ the death of death which you flee will surely overtake you
then you will be returned to him who knows the unseen and the seen and the seen and the seen he will inform you of what you used to do
o you who believe when the call is made to prayer on friday hasten to the remembrance of allah and leave trading
that is better for you if you only knew
and when the prayer is ended disperse in the land and seek allah s bounty and remember allah much that you may prosper
and when they see some trading or amusement they play and leave you standing say “ what is with allah is better than sport and the amusement and allah is the best of providers ”
when the hypocrites come to you they say we bear witness that you are indeed the messenger of allah
allah knows that you are indeed his messenger and allah bears witness that the hypocrites are indeed liars
they have taken their oaths as a shield and bar from the way of allah
evil is what they used to do
that is because they believed then disbelieved so their hearts became sealed so they are not responsible for their having no knowledge
when you see them their bodies please you and when they speak you listen to their sayings they are disregardful
they are like dry logs of every shout they will be shut out of it they will be in utter humiliation or <unk> cloaks
allah kills them
how are they being turned away
and when it is said to them come the messenger of allah ask forgiveness for you they turn their heads and you see them turn away their faces away disdainful
it is equal to them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them allah will never forgive them
allah does not guide the transgressing lot
they are they who say do not spend on those who are with allah until they scatter off from the messenger of allah
and to allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
they say if we return to the city they will expel the weaker therein
but to allah belongs all honour and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know
o believers let not your possessions nor your children distract you from the remembrance of allah
and whosoever does that then those they are the losers
and spend of what we have provided you before death comes to one of you and he says “ my lord i have favored you for a little while so that i may give alms and be among the righteous ”
and allah grants respite to anyone when his time comes
and allah is allaware of what you do
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols allah s glory ’
his is the sovereignty and his is the praise and he is able to do all things
it is he who created you and among you are some who are believers and some are believers
and allah is allseer of what you do
he created the heavens and the earth with truth and he shaped you and made you good and to him is the final return
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and he knows what you hide
he is aware of what is in the breasts of men
has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before you
they tasted the evil result of their action and for them is a painful punishment
that was because their messengers came to them with clear explanations but they said were there not our guides to the right way
and allah is allsufficient alllaudable
the faithless assert that they will never be raised up again
say yes by my lord you will surely be raised to life and you will be raised to life
that is easy for allah
so believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and the light which we have sent down
and allah is allaware of what you do
the day when he gathers you for the day of mutual exchange that will be a day of mutual loss
he who believes in allah and does good deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow and will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow
that is the supreme achievement
but as for those who disbelieve and denounce our revelations such are rightful owners of the fire they shall abide therein an evil homecoming
no calamity befalls except by the permission of allah
he guides those who are obedient to allah
allah has knowledge of everything
obey allah and obey his messenger but if you turn away then the duty of our messenger is only to convey the message clearly
allah there is no god but he
in allah let the believers put their trust
o you who believe if you are enemies of your wives and your children but if you pardon them then beware of them and beware of them and forgive you and overlook their faults indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
your possessions and your children are only a trial and allah with him is a mighty wage
so fear god as you can see your hearing and give ear and obey and spend in the way of god
and whosoever is protected from niggardliness of his own soul such are the successful
if you lend allah a good loan he will multiply it for you and forgive you
allah is allthankful allclement
knower of the unseen and the seen the allmighty the allwise
o men when you divorce women divorce them at night and calculate the term of their term and fear allah your lord
and do not expel them from their houses nor expel them from their houses nor go away except by the enemy
these are the bounds of allah
whosoever exceeds the bounds of allah has been wronged
you know perhaps maybe allah will bring about something new life after this
then when they have reached their term either retain them honourably or part from them honourably
and call to witness two witnesses from among you and give up testimony in allah s cause that you should be witnesses to the believers
so whoever believes in allah and the last day is warned
and whosoever fears allah he will appoint for him a way out
and will provide for him from whence he never reckoned
and whosoever putteth his trust in allah he will suffice him
allah will accomplish his purpose
allah has set a measure for all things
as for those of your women who have despaired of menstruation if you have doubts their period then have not three months as those who have not menstruated
as for those who are pregnant their term shall be till they deliver their burden
allah will make things easy for him who fears allah
that is allah s ordinance ’ which he has sent down to you and whoever fears allah he will remit his sins and will enlarge his reward
lodge them where you reside according to your means and do not harass them until they are pregnant
and if they suckle their child then give them their due compensation and consult together honourably
and if you make difficulties for him then let him suckle for the child
let the man of plenty expend according to his means and let him expend of what allah has given him
allah asketh naught from that which he hath given him
allah will bring ease after difficulty
how many habitations rebelled against the command of its lord and his apostles and we took it to be a severe reckoning
so it tasted the result of its decisions and the outcome of its decisions was loss
allah has prepared for them a severe punishment so fear allah o men of understanding
allah has sent down to you a reminder
a messenger reciting to you the verses of allah that he may bring forth those who believe and do good deeds from darkness into light
and whosoever believeth in allah and worketh righteously he will admit him into gardens underneath which rivers flow therein to dwell forever
allah has made for him a goodly provision
it is allah who created seven heavens and the earth
the commandment of allah is over all things knowing that you possess knowledge of everything and that you may know that allah surrounds comprehends all things
o prophet why do you forbid what god has made lawful to you
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
allah has ordained for you absolution from your oaths
he is your maula lord and knowing
and when the prophet confided a matter to one of his wives and allah disclosed it to his wife and he made known to him part of it known to him
so when he informed her about it she said who informed you of this he said who informed me about the allknowing
if you repent to god then your hearts are hostile to him and if you are hostile to him then god is his protector and the guardians of the believers and the angels and the supporters of the prophet and the believers and the righteous are the beloved of
it may be that if he divorces you his lord will give him in exchange wives better than you muslims who are obedient penitent devout
o you who believe protect yourselves and your families from fire whose fuel is men and stones over which are angels stern and stern in charge of which they are commanded
o ye who disbelieve
do not feign excuses today you are being requited except for what you used to do
o you who believe turn to allah with sincere repentance
perhaps your lord will remit from you your sins and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow and the day when allah will not abase those who believe with him
their light will run before them and they will say our lord
forgive us and have given us control over all things
o prophet strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them and their refuge is hell and what an evil destination
allah illustrates an example for the faithless the wife of noah and the wife of lot they are the ones who were under the wife of lot
they were under our righteous so they availed them not against allah s ’ help them and they said to them “ enter the fire with those who enter the fire ”
and allah illustrates an example of the believers when she said “ my lord build me a house in paradise and save me from pharaoh and his assembly and deliver me from the iniquitous people ”
and mary imran who guarded her virginity and we breathed into her of our spirit and she testified to her lord and his words and she was of the obedient
blessed is he in whose hand is the sovereignty and he is able to do all things
who created death and life that he might test you which of you is best in conduct and he is the mighty the forgiver
who created seven heavens one above another
you will see no incongruity in the creation of the allbeneficent
look again do you see any cracks
then look again
your gaze would return to you in it and weary
and assuredly we have adorned the lower heaven with lamps and we have made them missiles against the devils and we have prepared for them the chastisement of the blaze
for those who disbelieve in their lord there is the torment of hell and what an evil destination
when they are cast into it they will hear it roar and raging
wellnigh it be rent asunder with rage
every time a group is cast therein its keepers will ask them did no warner come to you
they will say yes indeed but a warner came to us by allah s command ’ and said “ we did not send it down ”
you are but in huge error
they will say if only we had listened or become simply <unk> we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing fire
so they acknowledge their sins and will surely admit them to the chastisement of the fire
indeed those who fear their lord in secret will have forgiveness and a great reward
whether you keep secret or disclose it he knows what is in the breasts
will he not know that he who created
it is he who made the earth subservient to you so walk in its regions and eat of his provision and to him is the uprising
are you confident that he who is in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up while it quakes
or are you confident that he who is in heaven will not unleash against you a violent wind stones
then you will know how my warning is
those before them also denied the truth then how was my disapproval
have they not seen the birds above them spreading their wings and folding them
none sustains them except the allbeneficent
he oversees everything
or who is this that will be your army that will help you against the most merciful
the unbelievers are in naught but illusion
who is he that will provide for you if he withholds his provision
nay but they persist in rebellion and aversion
is he who walks prone on his face better guided or he who walks upright on a straight path
say it is he who created you and gave you ears and eyes and hearts little thanks you thank
say it is he who scattered you in the earth and unto him you shall be gathered
and they say when will this promise come to pass if you are truthful
say “ knowledge of it rests with god i am only a clear warner ”
when they see it approaching the faces of the faithless will be awry and it will be said ‘ this is what you used to seek ’
say o muhammad saw tell me if allah destroys me or those with me or those who have mercy upon us and who will protect the disbelievers from allah s punishment and will save the disbelievers from the painful punishment
say he is the merciful we believe in him and in him we put our trust
you will soon know who is in manifest error ’
say have you thought if your water were to disappear into the earth who could bring you water from the water flowing stream out for you
nun
by the pen and what they inscribe
you are not demented by the grace of your lord
and verily for you is a reward unfailing
and indeed you o muhammad saw are of a great character
you will see and they will see
which of you is afflicted with madness
your lord knows best those who have gone astray from his path and he knows best those who are guided
so do not obey the deniers
they wish that you may compromise so they would compromise
and do not obey any vile swearer
backbiter spreader abroad of slanders
hinderer of the good transgressor sinful
crude and above all mean and ignoble
because he has wealth and sons
when our verses are recited to him he says fairytales of the ancients
we shall brand him on the muzzle
we have tested them as we tested the owners of the garden when they vowed to harvest the morning they will surely reap its harvest
without any reservation
then a visitation from your lord came to it while they slept
so in the morning it became as if picked
then they called out to one another
go to your tillage if you want to reap
so they departed whispering together
no needy man shall enter it today against you
and they went early early morning bent on oath early determined
but when they saw it they said ‘ indeed we have lost the way ’
nay but we are desolate
the most moderate of them said “ did i not say to you why do you not glorify god ”
they said glory be to our lord
we were indeed wrongdoers ’
then they turned to one another blaming each other
they said “ woe to us indeed we were insolent
maybe our lord will give us a better than it
we humbly humbly turn to our lord
such is the punishment
and indeed the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they but knew
verily for the godfearing are gardens of delight with their lord
shall we then treat those who have surrendered like the sinners
what is the matter with you
what is the matter with you how do you judge
or have you a book in which you read
that ye may choose for yourselves therein
or have you oaths from us reaching to the day of resurrection that you will surely have whatever you demand
ask them which of them will guarantee that
or do they have partners then let them bring their associates if they are truthful
on the day when the shin shall be exposed and they will be called to prostrate themselves and they will not be able to prostrate
with eyes downcast abasement stupefying them
they were invited to bow down while they were whole
so leave me with those who deny this discourse
we will draw them from whence they do not know
i will give them respite
my plan is firm
or do you ask them for a wage so that they are burdened with debt
or is the unseen so they write it down
so wait patiently with your lord s judgement and do not be like the fish who called out choking the fish when he called out choking inwardly
had there not been a grace from his lord reached him he would have been cast into the wilderness
but his lord chose him and made him one of the righteous
indeed those who disbelieve wellnigh smite you with their glances when they hear the reminder and they say “ he is crazy ”
but it is nothing but a reminder to all the worlds
the indubitable event
what is the striking hour
and what will show you what is the besieger
the tribes of thamud and ad denied the calamity of the day of judgement
as for thamood they were destroyed by the cry
and as for ad they were destroyed by a violent roaring wind
he unleashed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so that you might see the people lying down prostrate as if they were stumps of uprooted palmtrees
do you see any trace of them
and pharaoh and those before him and the overturned cities overthrown while they were sleeping
they disobeyed the messenger of their lord so he seized them with a terrible seizing
lo when the water rose high we bore you in the sailing ark
that we might make it a reminder for you and that receptive ears might remember it
then when the trumpet is blown with a single blast
and the earth and the mountains are lifted up and crushed with a single blow
so on that day will the imminent hour befall
and the heaven will crack so on that day it will be frail
and the angels will stand upon their sides and on the throne of your lord is a witness over them
on that day you will be exposed no secret of yours will be hidden
then as for him who is given his book in his right hand he will say here read my book
i knew that i would encounter my reckoning
so he will be in a life wellpleasing
in a lofty garden
the clusters of fruits hanging low
eat and drink with relish that which ye have been working
but as for him who is given his book in his left hand he will say would that i had not been given my book
and that i knew not my reckoning
oh would that it had been the end of me
my riches have not availed me
my authority has gone from me
it will be said seize him and bind him
then cast him into the blazing fire
then insert him in a chain seventy cubits long
he would not believe in allah the mighty
nor urged others to feed the needy
so he has no friend here today
nor any food except pus
which none but sinners eat
i swear by all that you see
and by that you do not see
this is the speech of a noble messenger
it is not the speech of a poet little do you believe
nor is it the speech of a soothsayer little do you reflect
a revelation from the lord of the worlds
had he invented sayings concerning us
we would have seized him by the right hand
then we would have cut off his lifevein
and none of you could have restrained us from punishing him
and verily it is an admonition unto the godfearing
we know that some of you will deny it
and verily it is a sorrow for the disbelievers
and verily it is absolute truth
so glorify the name of your lord the allsupreme
a requester seeks to befall
which none can avert from the disbelievers
from allah lord of the ascending steps
whereby the angels and the spirit ascend unto him in a day whereof the measure is fifty thousand years
so be patient with a beautiful patience
they behold it afar off
but we see it near
the day when the sky will be like molten silver
and the mountains will be like tufted wool
and no friend will inquire friend
they will be given sight of one another but he will not be able to ransom himself from the punishment of the day of resurrection
and his spouse and his brother
and his kin that harboured him
and all those who are in the earth so that it might deliver him
nay
it is the fire of hell
which strips away the scalp
it invites him who turned his back and fled
and accumulated wealth and hoarded it
verily man was created anxious
when evil befalls him he is bewailing
and when good comes upon him grudging
except those who closely are devoted
who are constant in their prayer
and those in whose wealth there is a known right
for the beggar and the destitute
and those who believe in the day of recompense
and those who fear the chastisement of their lord
verily the torment of their lord is not a thing to be unafraid of
and those who guard their private parts
except with their wives and those whom their right hands possess for then they are not blameworthy
but whoever seeks beyond that — it is they who are the transgressors
and those who fulfil their trusts and covenants
and those who stand firm in their testimonies
and who are constant in their prayers
these will dwell in gardens honoured
what is the matter with the faithless that they stare at you
on the right and on the left in companies
does every man of them hope to enter the garden of delight
nay but we have created them from what they know
so i swear by the lord of the easts and the wests that we are able
and they will not be able to thwart them other than they and we are not to be outrun
so leave them to plunge and play until they encounter the day they are promised
the day when they emerge from the graves in haste as if racing to a goal
their eyes cast down overwhelmed by humiliation
that is the day they were promised
we sent noah to his people saying warn your people ere there comes to you a painful punishment
he said o my people i am a clear warner to you
worship allah and fear him and obey me
he will forgive you your sins and respite you until an appointed time
indeed when allah s term comes it can not be deferred if you but knew
he said my lord i have called my people night and day
but my calling is more powerful than them
and whenever i called them to forgive you and they thrust their fingers into their ears and wrapped them in their garments and persisted in their garments and persisted in their garments and waxed proud
then i called them openly
then i addressed them in public and i addressed them in secret
and i told them ask your lord for forgiveness
indeed he is ever forgiving
he will let loose the sky upon you in plenteous rain
and will provide you with wealth and children and will appoint for you gardens and will appoint for you rivers
what is the matter with you that you do not fear allah
and he created you by stages
have you not seen how allah created seven heavens one above another
and has made the moon a light and has made the sun a lamp
and allah has caused you to grow in the earth as a growth
then he will return you into it and will bring you forth again
and allah hath made the earth a wide expanse for you
so that you may tread its spacious paths
he said my lord they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children increase him in loss
and they have plotted a tremendous plot
and they said “ do not abandon your gods and do not leave wadd nor suwa yaghuth ya uq nor nasr ”
and they have led many astray
and o lord increase thou not the evildoers save in error
they were drowned for their iniquities and then they were drowned so they did not find any supporter for themselves against allah
noah said my lord leave not one of the unbelievers
if you leave them they will mislead your slaves and will beget none but the immoral
my lord forgive me and my parents and the believers who enters my house as a believer and the believers men and women and women who are believers
the wrongdoers do not increase anything except in error and do not increase the wrongdoers ”
say o muhammad saw it has been revealed to me that a company of jinn attentively listened to the recitation of the quran and said we have heard a wonderful qur an
guiding by the right path
we believe in it and we shall never associate anyone with our lord
and he exalted be the majesty of our lord hath taken neither a son nor a son
the foolish among us used to say nonsense about allah
and we thought that men and jinns would never speak against allah a lie
and some men used to seek protection from the jinns and men from among men but they increased them in confusion
they thought that you would think that allah would never resurrect the dead
and we sought to pry the secrets of the heaven but we found it filled with stern guards and shooting meteors
and we used to sit in wait for him who listens to eavesdrop but he who listens to eavesdrop
we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their lord intends for them rectitude
among us are some who are righteous and some are otherwise we are sects differing
we know that we can not frustrate allah in the earth nor frustrate him by flight
when we heard the guidance we believed in it
whosoever believes in his lord and does good shall have no fear of the suffering loss
and some of us are muslims and some of us are deviant
and whosoever hath surrendered unto allah those they are the rightly guided
but as for those who deviated from the truth they will be firewood for hell
then if they had been steadfast on the right path we would have given them abundant water
that we might try them thereby
and whosoever turns away from the remembrance of his lord he will thrust him into a torment vehement
and the places of worship are for allah so do not invoke anyone along with allah
when the servant of allah stood up to him they swarmed around him
say i call upon my lord and i do not associate anything with him
say “ i have no control over you nor harm you ”
say “ none can protect me from allah nor can i find any refuge besides him ”
except my messages and whoever dreads it from allah and his messages
for those who disobey allah and his messenger there is a fire of hell and they will abide therein eternally
till when they see what they are promised they will know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers
say i do not know whether what you are promised is near or whether my lord has promised it a distant term
he is the knower of the unseen and he does not disclose his unseen to anyone
except for a messenger to whom he chooses chosen and he approves of the unseen and he held behind a sentinel behind
so that he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their lord and that he encompasses all things
o you enwrapped one
stand up for prayer except a little
a half of it or reduce it a little
or add a little more proper and recite the qur an
we shall cast upon you a weighty word
indeed the vigil of night is firmer in tread more effective and more suitable for speech
indeed in that you o muhammad saw have sought to talk your ewe in the night
and remember the name of your lord and devote yourself to him with exclusive devotion
lord of the east and the west there is no god but he so take him for your trustee
and bear thou patiently with that which they say and forsake them with a fine departure
leave me to deal with those who cry lies to my signs and respite them awhile
we have fetters and a blazing fire
and food that chokes and a painful punishment
on the day when the earth and the mountains will tremble and the mountains will be in a heap of sand
we have sent to you a messenger as a witness over you
so pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so we seized him remorselessly
so how will you guard yourselves against the day when you will turn children
the heaven will shatter his promise is bound to be fulfilled
this is indeed an advice so whoever wills let him take a path to his lord
your lord knows that you stand vigil nearly twothirds of the night or a half of it or a third of it and a party of those with you
allah measureth the night and the day
he knows that you can not calculate it but he knows the koran so recite the koran of the koran as much as you are able to keep others apart from god
and recite to you some of your wealth and others travelling in the way of allah and others are travelling in the land seeking his bounty
so recite of it as much as is feasible and practice regular charity and lend allah a good loan
whatever good you send ahead for your souls you will find it with allah and better is the greatest success
and ask forgiveness of allah
allah is forgiving merciful
o you o you who have seen
arise and warn
and magnify your lord
and purify your clothes
and pollution shun
and bestow not favour seeking wordly gain
and be patient for the sake of your lord
when the trumpet is blown
that will be a harsh day
not a easy day for the unbelievers
leave me alone with whom i created lonely
and furnished him with extensive means
and sons abiding in his presence
and made things smooth for him
yet he desires that i should give more
no
he is refractory of our signs
i will constrain him to climb a fearful affliction
he reflected and then hatched up
death seize him how he determined
again death seize him how he determined
then he looked
then frowned and scowled
then he walked away disdainfully
and said this is nothing but magic from the past
this is nothing but a mortal man
i will cast him into saqar
and what will show you what is saqar
it neither leaves nor spares
scorching the skin
over it are nineteen
we have not appointed any one to be wardens of the blaze
we have appointed the number of the faithless only increased the faithless say ‘ is the same that the faithless may be in faith ’ and those who have faith ’ and that those who have faith may say ‘ what is the right way ’ and what is
thus allah sendeth astray whomsoever he will and guideth whomsoever he will
none knows the hosts of your lord except he
it is naught but a reminder unto mortals
no
by the moon
and the night when it retreats
and by the morning when it shineth forth
lo it is one of the greatest portents
a warning to humankind
to whoever among you desires to go forward or lag behind
every soul is hostage to what it has earned
except the people of the right hand
in gardens they will ask one another
concerning the guilty
“ what drove you into saqar ”
they will answer we were not of those who prayed
nor did we feed the needy
and we plunged along with the plungers
and we used to deny the day of retribution
until the inevitable came to us ’
so the intercession of the intercessors will not avail them
what is the matter with them that they turn away from the reminder
as if they were startled donkeys
fleeing away from a lion
nay each one of them desires that he should be given open pages
no indeed they do not fear the hereafter
nay verily this is a reminder
so whosoever wills may heed advice from it
but they will not heed unless allah wills
he is the fount of fear for him who fears allah
i swear by the day of resurrection
i swear by the accusing soul
does man think that we will not assemble his bones
yes indeed we are able to shape his fingertips
nay but man desires to persist in the evil way
he asks when will be this day of resurrection
but when the sight is dazed
and the moon is eclipsed
and the sun and the moon are joined together
on that day man will say where is the escape
no indeed there is no refuge
to your lord that day is the recourse
on that day man will be informed of what he had sent ahead and left behind
nay man shall be a witness against himself
even though he offer his excuses
do not move your tongue with it to hurry upon it
it is for us to collect it and to recite it
so when we recite it follow its recitation
then it is for us to explain it
no
you love this transient life
and neglect the hereafter
many faces will be fresh on that day
looking toward their lord
and some faces that day will be gloomy
realizing that a crushing calamity is about to fall upon them
nay when the soul reaches up to the collar bone
and it is said who is there any enchanter
and he thinks that it is the parting
and leg is intertwined with leg
on that day the driving will be to your lord
he neither believed nor prayed
but he denied and turned away
then he walked in full pride to his family
nearer to you o man disbeliever and then again
again woe to you o man disbeliever and then again woe to you
does man think that he will be left to roam at hand
was he not a drop of ejaculated semen
then he became a clot then he created and proportioned him
and made of him two sexes male and female
is he then unable to revive the dead
has there not a period of time when he was an unremembered thing
indeed we created man from a sperm yoked to see him so we made him hearing and sight and made him hearing
we guided him to the way of rectitude whether he is guided or ungrateful
we have prepared for the faithless chains and yokes and searing ones
verily the abrar pious who fear allah and avoid evil will drink from a cup whereof the admixture will drink
a spring of the worshipers of allah drink causing it to gush forth abundantly
they fulfil their vows and dread the day of which they are promised
and they feed for him the love of him and the needy and the captive
saying we feed you only for the sake of allah
we wish no reward nor thanks from you
we fear from our lord a day of frowning and evil horrible plants
so allah warded off from the evil of that day and gave them radiance and joy
and recompensed them for their patience with a garden and silk
reclining therein on couches they will recline therein and will be neither the sun nor the moon
its shade hovering over them and its fruit clusters of fruits will hang down
and passed round them vessels of silver and cups of crystal
crystal of silver which they will determine to be made immortal
they will be served therein with a cup of wine mixed with zanjabil ginger
a spring in it named salsabeel
immortal youths shall go about them
if you see them you think they would think them scattered pearls
when you look you look in it you will see serenity and a great kingdom
upon them will be garments of fine green silk and gold embroidery bracelets of silver and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver and their lord will give them a pure drink
it will be said “ this is your reward and your efforts have been appreciated ”
we have revealed to you the qur an an ’
so be patient under the judgment of your lord and do not obey any sinner or ingrate against them
and remember the name of your lord morning and evening
and prostrate yourself to him and glorify him in the night
indeed these love the hasty life and leave behind them a heavy day
it is we who created them and strengthened their skeleton and we will replace them with others like them
this is an advice so whoever wills let him take a way to his lord
but you will not unless god wills
indeed allah is allknowing allwise
he admits into his mercy whomever he wills and for the unjust he has prepared a painful punishment
by the <unk> emissaries sent successively
by those who sweep violently
by those that revive and carry out
by those who winnow with a winnowing
and those that bring down the reminder
excusing or warning
what you are promised will surely befall
so when the stars are extinguished
and when the sky is rent asunder
and when the mountains are blown away
and when the messengers are collected at the time of the time of their time arrives
for what day is it timed
for the day of decision
and what will show you what is the day of decision
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
did we not destroy the ancients
then we shall later follow the latter generations
thus do we deal with the guilty
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
did we not create you from a base fluid
which we placed in a depository safe
for a known term
we measured precisely
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
have we not made the earth a receptacle
for the living and the dead
and we placed firm mountains and gave you sweet water to drink
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
depart unto that which ye used to deny
depart to a shadow of three columns
which neither shady nor saves against the blazing fire
it throws out sparks like dry faggots
as if they were yellow camels yellow passing by <unk> yellow <unk>
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
this is a day when they will not speak
nor will they be given permission to excuse themselves
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
this is the day of decision we have assembled you and the ancients
if you have any stratagems try to devise against me
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
verily the godfearing shall be amid shades and springs
and fruits such as they desire
eat and drink with relish for what you used to do
thus do we reward the good
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
eat and enjoy yourselves for a while you are indeed criminals
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
and when it is said to them bow down they do not bow down
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
in what discourse after this will they believe
what are they asking one another
about the great news
about which they differ
no indeed soon they will know
again no indeed soon they will know
have we not made the earth a cradle
and the mountains as pegs
and we created you in pairs
and we have made your sleep a rest
and made the night a covering
and we made the day for livelihood
and we have built above you seven strong heavens
and placed in them a blazing lamp
and have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant water
that we may produce thereby grain and plants
and luxuriant gardens
indeed the day of decision is a fixed time
the day when the trumpet is blown and you will come in crowds
and the heaven is opened and becometh as gates
and the mountains are set in motion and become a mirage
indeed hell is a ambush
a dwelling place for the taghun those who transgress the truth
they will abide therein for ages
they will taste therein cool and no drink
save boiling water and wash of wounds
a fitting recompense
indeed they did not expect any reckoning
and they denied our signs so they were plunged in the light
and everything we have recorded in a book
so taste you the results of what you sowed for we will increase nothing but torment
indeed for the godwary there is a place of security
gardens and vineyards
and fullbreasted maidens of equal age
and a cup overflowing
they will hear therein no babble nor any falsehood
a recompense from your lord a gift sufficient gift and a recompense
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
they will not have any power over him
on the day when the spirit and the angels stand in rows and the angels speak to him who speaketh right and says what is right and he is not right
that is the true day so whosoever wills takes resort to his lord
we have warned you of a near punishment by the day when a man will see what his hands have forwarded and the unbeliever will say alas would that i were dust
by those who snatch violently
by those who draw out vehemently
and those who glide smoothly
and by those who racing
and those who govern the affairs of the affairs
the day when the first blowing of the trumpet will shake with a sudden
and the second blast is sounded
hearts will throb on that day
their looks will be downcast
they say shall we be restored to life after the former state
even after we have become bones decayed bones
they say “ this is a losing ”
but it will be only a single shout
and lo they will be awakened
has there come to you the story of moses
when his lord called out to him in the holy valley of tuwa
go to pharaoh
indeed he has transgressed
and say to him ‘ would you purify yourself
and i will guide you to your lord so that you may fear him
so moses showed him the greatest sign
but he denied and defied
then he turned away striving in his way
then he gathered and proclaimed
he said i am your lord the most high
so allah seized him with the punishment of the hereafter and they remained in it
surely in that is a lesson for him who fears
are you harder to create or the heaven he has built it
he raised its roof and proportioned it
and darkened its night and brought forth its forenoon
and after that he spread out the earth
and brought out its water and its pasture
and the mountains he set firm
a provision for you and your cattle
but when the greatest universal disaster arrives
the day when man will remember what he strove for
and hell will be brought forward to him who sees
then as for him who was insolent
and preferred the life of this world
verily hell will be his home
but as for him who feared the standing before his lord and restrained himself from impure evil desires
the garden of refuge shall be his resort
they ask you about the hour when will it come
what concern do you have to mention
to your lord is its finality
you are only a warner for those who fear it
on the day when they see it it will be as if they had stayed in the morning or evening or afternoon
he frowned and turned away
because the blind man came to him
and what could make you know perhaps he would purify himself
or that the admonition may benefit him
as for him who thinketh himself independent
you attended him with his heart
though it is not thy concern if he does not purify himself
but as for him who cometh unto thee eagerly
and fearfully
you are neglectful of him
no
this is a reminder
so whosoever wills let him remember it
in honoured pages
exalted and purified
by the hands of scribes
noble and pious
accursed is man because of what an ungrateful
from what did he create him
from a sperm drop he created him and enabled him
then eased his way for him
then he caused him to die and buried him
then when he wills he raises him
nay but man hath not done that which he commanded him
let man consider his food
we poured forth the rains abundantly
then we split the earth in clefts
and we make the grain grow in it
and grapes and fresh fodder
and olives and date palms
and dense orchards
and fruits and pastures
a provision for you and your cattle
but when the deafening noise comes
on that day man will flee from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his wife and his children
each one of them will have enough cares that day and none will hold him in his defence
some faces on that day will be beaming
laughing rejoicing
and some faces on that day will be covered with dust
blackness overcoming them
these are the unbelievers the wicked
when the sun is wound round
and when the stars fall down
and when the mountains are set moving
when the pregnant camels are neglected
and when the wild beasts are herded together
when the seas are set afire
when the souls are paired
and when the girl buried alive is asked
for what sin she was killed
and when the records are laid bare
and when the sky is torn away
when hell is set ablaze
and paradise brought nigh
then every soul will know what it has readied
so i swear by the stars
the comets
and by the night as it approaches
and by the morning when it shineth forth
this is the word of an honoured messenger
owner of power owner of power dignity with the lord of the throne
obeyed and honest
your companion is not mad
he saw him on the clear horizon
and he is not miserly concerning the unseen
and it is not the word of an accursed satan
so where are you going
it is just a reminder for all the nations
for whosoever of you is to walk straight
but you will not unless god wills the lord of all the worlds
when the heaven is split asunder
and when the stars are scattered
when the seas are poured forth
when the graves are overturned
then everyone shall know what he had sent ahead and what he left behind
o man what seduced you
who created you formed you and proportioned you
in whatever form he willed he could have fashioned you
no indeed you deny the judgement
yet there are over you watchers
noble scribes
who know whatever you do
verily the abrar pious will be in delight paradise
and verily the wicked will be in hell
they will enter it on the day of justice
and they will not be absent from it
and what will show you what is the day of recompense
again what will convey unto thee what the day of recompense is
it is a day when no soul shall possess for another soul and the command of allah is for the command of allah
woe to the defrauders who give less
those who when they measure from mankind demand full measure
but when they measure or weigh for them they reduce
do they not know that they will be raised up
on a mighty day
the day when mankind will stand before the lord of the worlds
no
the record of the wicked will be in sijjeen
and what will show you what is sijjeen
a register inscribed
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
those who deny the day of recompense
and none denies it except every sinful transgressor
when our verses are recited to him he says fairytales of the ancients
no
nay but their hearts have become empty
no indeed they will be screened off from seeing their lord that day
then they will enter hell
then it will be said this is what you used to deny
no
the record of the righteous are in the illiyoon
and what will show you what is illeeyun
a register inscribed
which are those brought nigh
verily the pious are in delight
on couches gazing
you will recognize in their faces the freshness of bliss
they will be served with wine sealed wine
whose seal is musk — this is the competitors compete
for him is an entertainment
and admixture thereof is water of tasnim
a spring from which drink those brought nigh
indeed the guilty used to laugh at the faithful
and winked at one another when they passed them by winking
and when they returned to their families they would return amused
and when they saw them they said verily these are the astray
but they were not sent as guardians over them
so today the believers are laughing at the unbelievers
on luxurious furnishings looking on
have the unbelievers been rewarded for what they used to do
and when the sky is rent asunder
and hearkens to its lord as it must
and when the earth is stretched out
and casts out what is within it and becomes empty
and hearkens to its lord as it should
o man you are laboring towards your lord and you will encounter him
then as for him who is given his book in his right hand
he will receive an easy reckoning
and will return to his family rejoicing
but he who is given his book behind his back
he will call for destruction
and will enter the blaze
he lived rejoicing in his family
thinking he thought that he would never return
no
his lord was ever watching him
i swear by the afterglow of sunset
and by the night and what it envelops
and by the moon when it is at the full
you will climb from stage
what is the matter with them that they do not believe
and when the qur an is recited to them they do not prostrate themselves
nay but those who disbelieve belie
and allah knows best what they gather and bad deeds
so give them glad tidings of a painful punishment
except those who believe and do good deeds
theirs shall be a hire unending
by the heaven which contains the constellations
by the promised day
and by the witness and the witnessed
accursed are the people of the ditch
the fire abounding in fuel
when they sat by it
and they witnessed what they had done to the believers
they had no power over them except that they believed in allah the almighty the praised
to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
allah is witness over everything
indeed those who persecute the believers men and women and then repent and do not repent for them is the punishment of burning
indeed those who believe and do good deeds for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow
that is the supreme success
verily the grip of your lord is severe
it is he who originates and brings again
and he is the forgiving the loving
lord of the throne the allglorious
doer of what he wills
has there come to you the story of the hosts
of pharaoh and thamood
nay but those who disbelieve are in denial
and allah surrounds them
nay it is a glorious quran
inscribed in allauh almahfuz
by the heaven and the nightcomer
and what will show you what is the nightly visitor
it is the star that shines with piercing brightness
there is no human being but has he over it
so let man consider from what he was created
he was created from a gushing fluid
that issues from between the loins and the ribs
he is able to bring him back to life
on the day when the secrets are examined
he will have no strength nor any helper
by the sky which returns
and by the earth which splitteth
this quran is a decisive word
and it is not a frivolity
they are devising a stratagem
and i am devising guile
so respite the faithless
deal thou gently with them gently
glorify the name of your lord the most high
who created and shaped
who determined and guided
who brings forth the pasture
then made it dry dark stubble
we shall make you read so you will not forget
except what allah wills
he knows what is visible and what is hidden
we shall ease you to ease the way of ease
so remind if the reminder profits
he who fears will heed advice
but the most wretched will avoid it
who will enter the great fire
wherein he will neither die nor live
prosperous is he who purifies himself
and mentions the name of his lord and prays
nay but ye prefer the life of this world
whereas the hereafter is better and more lasting
this is in the former scriptures
the scriptures of abraham and moses
has there come to you the news of the overwhelming
faces on that day will be downcast
labouring hard
roasting at a scorching fire
given to drink from a spring fiercely boiling
they will have no food except bitter thorn
which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger
many faces will be joyous on that day
wellpleased with their endeavour
in a lofty garden
where they will hear no idle talk
in it is a flowing spring
in which are high thrones
and goblets set
and cushions ranged
and carpets spread out
do they not see the camel how it has been created
and the sky how it is raised
and the mountains how they are set
and the earth how it has been spread out
so remind them o muhammad you are only a reminder
you are not a dictator over them
but he who turns away and disbelieves
allah will punish him with the greatest punishment
to us is their return
then on us is their reckoning
by the dawn
and ten nights
and by the even and the odd
by the night when it departs
is there in that a lesson for man enduring
have you not seen how your lord dealt with the tribe of a ad
iram of the pillars
the like of which was not created in the land
and thamood who hollowed the rocks in the valley
and pharaoh of the tent pegs
who rebelled in the cities
and exceeded in corruption therein
so your lord poured on them lashes of punishment
indeed your lord is ever watchful
as for man when his lord tests him and honors him and prospers him he says my lord has honoured me
but when he tries him by straitening his means of livelihood he says my lord has humiliated me
no
but you do not treat the orphans with the orphan
and urge not on the feeding of the poor
and you devour inheritance with greed
and love wealth with much love
no
when the earth quakes and is pounded
and your lord comes and angels row on row
and hell is brought near that day man will remember but how will remembrance avail him
he will say would that i had forwarded for my life
on that day none can punish as he punishes
and none can bind as he binds
o you tranquil soul
return to your lord wellpleased wellpleasing
enter among my servants
enter my garden
i swear by this city mecca
and you are free of this city
and by oath of the parent and his offspring
we created man in fatigue
does he think that no one has power over him
he says “ i have squandered enormous wealth ”
does he think that no one sees him
did we not give him two eyes
and a tongue and two lips
and shown him the two highways
but he has not assaulted the steep
and what will show you what is saqar
it is freeing a neck slave
or giving food upon a day of hunger famine
an orphan near of kin
or a poor man cleaving in dust
then he becomes one of those who believed and recommended one another to perseverance and compassion
they are the people of the right hand
but those who disbelieve in our signs they are the people of the left hand
upon them is a fire covered them with a fire
by the sun and its midmorning
and by the moon when she follows him
and by the day when it displays him
and by the night when it envelops it
and by the heaven and him who built it
and by the earth and him who spread it
and by the soul and him who proportioned it
and inspired it with its wickedness and its piety
he who nourishes it will surely prosper
and he who suppresses it will be ruined
the tribe of thamud denied the truth in their perverseness
when the most wicked among them broke out of rage
the messenger of allah said to them “ stop the shecamel of allah and her drink ”
but they called him a liar and hamstrung her
so their lord crushed them for their sin and leveled it
he does not fear its result
by the night when it envelops
and by the day when it breaks in its glory
and by him who created the male and female
your endeavors are indeed diverse
and whosoever giveth and giveth him his hire
and believes in the finest
we will ease him to ease the path of ease
but as for him who hoardeth and deemeth himself independent
and belied the finest
we will ease his way towards difficulty
his wealth will not avail him when he falls headlong into ruin
indeed guidance is upon us
and to us belong the next life and the world
so i have warned you of a blazing fire
which none shall enter except the most wretched
who belied the truth and turned away
and the godfearing shall be kept away from it
who gives his wealth to purify himself
and no one can withhold his favour
but only seeking the countenance of his lord the most high
he will be wellpleased with his lord
by the morning brightness
and by the night when it covers
your lord has not forsaken you nor does he dislike you
and the latter is better for you than the former
your lord will give you and you will be satisfied
did he not find you an orphan and protect you
did he not find you unaware of the right way
and found you poor and enriched you
so do not oppress the orphan
and do not drive away the beggar
and proclaim the blessings of your lord
have we not opened your breast
and relieve you of your burden
which weighed down your back
and we have upraised your fame
indeed with hardship is ease
indeed hardship is ease
so when you finish the prayer strive for prayer
and turn your faces to your lord with a weary
by the fig and the olive
and by mount sinai
and by this secure city
we created man in the best mould
then we reduced him to the lowest of the low
except those who believe and do good deeds for them is a reward unfailing
so what will convey to you the recompense
is not allah the best of judges
read in the name of your lord who created
created man from a clot
read and your lord is the most generous
who taught by the pen
taught man what he did not know
nay but man is rebellious
that he thinketh himself independent
to your lord is the return
bethinkest thou him who forbiddeth
a slave when he prayeth
have you thought if he were upon guidance
or enjoineth piety
bethinkest thou if he belieth and turneth away
does he not know that allah sees
no
if he does not desist we will seize him by the forelock
a lying sinful forelock
so let him call his gang
we will call the guards of hell
no
o you prophet muhammad peace be upon him
so prostrate yourself and become close to your lord
we sent it down on the night of determination
and what will show you what is the night of determination
the night of power is better than a thousand months
in it the angels and the spirit descend by the leave of their lord with all decrees
peace until the rising of dawn
the faithless among the people of the book and the idolaters would not have known the proof of the matter would not have been left behind until the proof of the evidence of the prophet
a messenger from allah reciting purified pages
in which are valuable writings
the people of the book had not believed in the least except after the clear proof came to them
and they were commanded only to worship allah dedicating their religion sincerely his religion exclusively to him and to establish prayer and give zakah
that is the right religion
verily those who disbelieve among the people of the scripture and the idolaters will abide therein eternally
they are the worst of creatures
but those who believe and do good deeds are the best of creatures
their recompense is with their lord gardens of eternity beneath which rivers flow where they will abide for ever
that is for him who fears his lord
when the earth is shaken with its quake
and the earth brings forth her burdens
and man saith what aileth her
on that day she will relate her chronicles
for your lord will have inspired it
on that day mankind will issue in scatterings to see their deeds
and whosoever does an atom s weight of good will see it
and whosoever does an atom s weight of evil will see it
by the snorting courses
striking sparks of fire
raiding at dawn
raising clouds of dust
cleaving in the way of one another
verily man is ungrateful to his lord
and he bears witness to that
and he is fierce in his love of wealth
does he not know when the contents of the graves are poured out
and what is in the breasts is brought out
on that day their lord will be informed about them
the clatterer
what is the striking hour
and what will show you what is the catastrophe
the day when mankind will be like scattered moths
and the mountains will be like tufted wool
then he whose scales are heavy
he will have a pleasing life
but he whose scales are light
his home will be the abyss
and what will show you what is the pit
a blazing fire
rivalry in abundance
until you reach the graves
no
soon you will know
no
soon you will know
nay if you knew with positive knowledge
you will surely see hell
again you will surely see it with certainty
then on that day you will be questioned about the bounties of allah
by the time
man is in loss
except those who believe and do good works and enjoin one another to endurance and enjoin one another to endurance
woe to every slanderer backbiter
who amasses wealth and counts it over
thinking his wealth will make him immortal
no
he will be thrown into the crusher
and what will show you what is the crusher
the fire of allah kindled
which will climb on
closed around them
in pillars stretched forth
have you not seen how your lord dealt with the people of the elephants
did he not make their plan go awry
and sent against them birds
pelting them with stones of baked clay
and made them like chewedup straw
for the taming of qureysh
their composing for the winter and summer
so let them worship the lord of this house
who fed them against hunger and secured them from fear
have you seen him who denies the retribution
that is he who repulses the orphan
and urges not the feeding of the needy
so woe to those who pray
who are heedless of their prayers delaying their prescribed times
who dissimulate
and refuse alma un small kindnesses eg salt sugar salt sugar and others etc
verily we have given thee abundance
so pray to your lord and sacrifice
verily it is he who hates you
say o disbelievers
i do not worship what you worship
nor do you worship what i worship
nor am i worshiping what you worship
nor will you worship what i worship
to you your religion and to me my religion
when the help of allah comes
and you see people entering allah s religion ’ in throngs
then glorify the praises of your lord and seek forgiveness
he is the relentant the merciful
perish the hands of abu lahab and perish he
his wealth will not avail him nor what he earned
he will be roasted in the fire
and his wife the firewood carrier
upon her neck is a rope of thorns
say he is allah the one
allah the absolute
he begetteth not nor was he begotten
and there is none equal to him
say i seek refuge with the lord of the daybreak
from the evil of what he has created
and from the evil of the darkness when it gathers
and from the evil of the witches who blow on knots
and from the evil of the envier when he envies
say i seek refuge with the lord of mankind
the king of mankind
the god of mankind
from the evil of the sneaky whisperer
who whispers in the breasts of men
the jinns and men
praise be to allah lord of the worlds
the merciful the most merciful
master of the day of recompense
you alone we worship and you alone we ask for help
guide us to the straight path
the path of those whom you have favoured not the path of those who have earned your anger nor of those who are astray
alif lam meem
this is the book whereof there is no doubt a guidance to those who ward off evil
who believe in the unseen and establish prayer and spend of what we have provided them
who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and are certain of the hereafter
these are on guidance from their lord and they are the successful
as for those who disbelieve it is the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believe
allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing and their sight is a covering and there is a blindfold upon them and for them is a mighty punishment
and of mankind are some who say we believe in allah and the last day and they are not believers
they think that they would deceive allah and those who believe but they perceive not
there is a sickness in their hearts and they have increased
allah promiseth them a disease of hypocrisy and for them is a painful punishment
and when it is said to them do not cause corruption in the land they say we are only reformers
lo it is they who are the corrupters but they perceive it not
and when it is said unto them believe as the people believe they say shall we believe as fools believe
it is they who are the fools but they do not know
when they meet those who believe they say we believe but when they are alone they say to their devils we are alone with you we were only mocking
allah will punish them and prolongs them in their transgression wandering blindly
they are the ones who purchased error for guidance so their trade did not profit them nor are they guided
their likeness is as a likeness of one who kindled a fire when it lit up all around him allah taketh away their light and left them in darkness whence they could not see
deaf dumb blind so they will not return
or like a rainstorm from the sky wherein is darkness thunder and lightning they thrust their fingers into their ears and their feet
but god surrounds the disbelievers
the lightning terrifies them as it were going to snatch away their eyesight
when it flashes forth they walk in its darkness and when it is recited they stand still
and if allah willed he could have taken away their hearing and their sight
indeed allah is over all things competent
o mankind worship your lord who created you and those before you that you may be cautious
he who made the earth a bed for you and the sky a canopy and sends down water from the sky and thereby producing fruits as sustenance for you
so do not set up rivals to allah while you know
and if you are in doubt concerning what we have sent down to our servant then produce a surah like it and call upon your witnesses to it if you are truthful
but if you do not and you will never be able to do it then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for the faithless
and give good news to those who believe and do good deeds that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow
whenever they are provided with fruit therefrom they will say ‘ this is what we had provided for us ’
and it is as a mixture of gold
and they will have therein pure spouses and they will abide therein eternally
indeed allah is not ashamed to coin a parable to swallow it
as for those who believe they know that it is the truth from their lord but as for those who disbelieve they say what does god intend by this parable
he misleads many thereby and guides many thereby
and he misleads not except the defiantly disobedient people
who break the covenant of allah after ratifying it and sever what allah has commanded to be joined and cause corruption on earth
these are the losers
how can you disbelieve in allah
he will give you life when you were dead and he will bring you back to life then you will return to him
it is he who created for you all that is in the earth then he turned to the heaven and fashioned it seven heavens
he is allknowing allaware
and when your lord said to the angels i am placing in the earth they said will you place a caliph in it and shed blood while we intone your praise and sanctify you in it
he said i know what you do not know
and he taught adam the names all of them then presented them to the angels saying tell me the names of these if you are truthful
they said glory be to you we have no knowledge except what you have taught us
we have no knowledge of it except what you have taught us
thou art the knower the wise
then he said to adam tell them their names
and when he told them their names he said did i not tell you that i know the unseen of the heavens and the earth and i know what you hide
and remember when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves to adam they prostrated themselves but iblis he refused and refused
then we said o adam dwell thou and thy wife in the garden and eat freely freely in it wherever you please but do not approach this tree lest you become wrongdoers
but satan caused them to slip therefrom and caused them to depart from that which they had been
we said go down one of you enemies together
on earth will be a residence for you and enjoyment for a while ”
then adam received certain words from his lord and he turned to him clemently and he is the most acceptor of repentance the most merciful
we said go down from hence all together and from you it shall come to you from me a guidance and whosoever follows my guidance no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein eternally
children of israel remember my favor which i bestowed upon you and fulfil my covenant and i will fulfil your covenant with you
so fear me
and believe in what i have sent down confirming what is with you and do not be the first to disbelieve in it
and sell not my revelations for a small price and fear me
do not mix the truth with falsehood nor conceal the truth while you know
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and irka bow down along with those who bow in worship
will you enjoin good things to mankind while you forget yourselves even though you read the scriptures
will you not understand
and seek help in patience and prayer
it is difficult for the devout
who know that they will meet their lord and that to him they will return
o children of israel remember my favor which i bestowed upon you and that i preferred you above all beings
and fear the day when no soul will die nor intercession will intercession be accepted from it nor will they be helped
and remember when we saved you from pharaoh s people who were afflicting you with the worst of their newborn sons and sparing your women
in that was a tremendous trial from your lord
and remember when we parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned pharaoh s clan ’
and recall what time we made musa moses forty nights for musa moses and harun
then you took to worshiping the calf after him and you were wrongdoers
then we pardoned you after that so that you might be grateful
and remember when we gave moses the book and the criterion so that you may be guided
and remember when moses said to his people “ o my people you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf for worship
so turn to your creator and kill yourselves
that is best for you with your creator and he is the relenting the merciful
and remember when you said o moses we will not believe in you until we see allah plainly and you were looking at you whilst the thunderbolt struck you while you were looking
then we revived you after your death so that you may be grateful
and we shaded you with clouds and sent down upon you manna and quails saying eat of the good things we have provided you
and they wronged us not but they used to wrong themselves
and remember when we said enter this township and eat freely in the gate prostrating and eat from the gate bowing humbly and say to allah forgive us and we will increase the doers of good
but those who wronged changed the word for they said to them so we sent down upon the evildoers wrath from heaven for their ungodliness
and remember when musa moses prayed for water for his people we said strike the rock with your stick
and there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs so that each tribe knew their drinkingplace
eat and drink of what allah has provided and do not act corruptly making mischief in the earth
and remember when you said o musa moses we will endure with one kind of food and our lord for us so that he may bring forth for us a burden like the animal which of the animal which you have spent and cucumbers and his offspring and lentils
those who believe and those who have faith and those who have faith in allah and the last day and do good deeds and the last day and do righteous deeds will have their reward with their lord and they will have no fear nor will they grieve
and remember when we took compact with you and raised the mount above you saying hold fast to what we have given you and remember what is in it so that you may be godwary
then after that you turned away
and if not for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you you would have been among the losers
and you know that some of you trespassed the sabbath
we said to them be apes despised
so we made it a deterrent punishment for the former and the latter and the succeeding generations and an admonition for the godfearing
and remember when moses said to his people “ god commands you to sacrifice a cow ” they said “ do you sacrifice a cow ”
he said i seek refuge in allah s cause from the ignorant
they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what she may be
he said “ he says it is a cow neither old nor old nor old
so do as you are commanded
they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what her colour may be
he said he says it is a yellow cow bright in color pleasing to the beholders
they said call upon your lord to make clear to us what he has created for us
verily we are ever full of wide wide open
he said he says it is a cow not broken to plough the earth nor to irrigate the field one without blemish
they said now you have brought the truth
so they slaughtered her though they were not doing it
and remember when you slew a man and disputed about his sin
and allah brought forth the state of iron
we said strike him with a part of it
thus allah brings the dead to life and shows you his signs that you may understand
then after that your hearts became like stones or even harder
indeed there are stones of which rivers burst forth and water issues from them and others crash down to the fear of allah
and allah is not unaware of what you do
do you then covet what they will believe
and of them are some who listen to the words of allah after they had understood it knowingly
and when they meet those who believe they say we believe but when they are alone they say to you they are disputing about what allah has disclosed to you so that they may argue about it with you concerning it
have you no sense
do they not know that allah knows what they hide and what they disclose
and among them are unlettered folk who know not the scripture but only wishful thoughts
they follow but guess
so woe to those who write the book with their hands and then say this is from allah that they may sell it for a little price
woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn
and they say the fire will not touch us except for a few days say “ you have taken a covenant from allah if you do not know ”
no the one who earns evil and his sin surrounds him and becomes besieged by the fire they will abide therein eternally
but those who believe and do good deeds are the inhabitants of paradise they will abide therein eternally
and remember when we took compact with the children of israel saying worship none but allah and be dutiful to your lord and speak to the orphans and to the needy and to the orphans and to the needy and to the wayfarer and speak to the orphans
then you turned away except a few of you and you are backsliders
and remember when we took compact with you saying shed not your blood relations nor expel each other from your homes
then you acknowledged this and you were witnessing
then you are killing one another and expelling a group of your homes from their homes and driving them in sin and aggression
and if they come to you as captives you ransom them although their expulsion was forbidden to you
then do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part
so what is the recompense of those who do so
and on the day of resurrection they will be returned to the severest punishment
and allah is not unaware of what you do
such are they who buy the worldly life at the price of the hereafter
so their punishment will not be lightened nor will they be helped
and we gave moses the scripture and we sent after him other messengers
we gave jesus son of mary clear signs and supported him with the spirit of purity gabriel
but whenever a messenger comes to you with what it did not suit you grew arrogant he turned back to you and repudiated some of their iniquities
and they say our hearts are uncircumcised
nay allah has cursed them for their unbelief
little is the faith that you believe
and when there came to them a book from allah confirming that which was before them when it came to them they recognized it when it came to them they recognized the words of allah they answered so when there came to them the truth they recognized it
so the curse of allah is upon the disbelievers
evil is that for which they have sold their ownselves out of envy among themselves that they should disbelieve in what allah has sent down grudging that allah should reveal of his bounty
so they incurred wrath upon wrath
and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment
and when it is said to them believe in what allah has revealed they say we believe in what was revealed to us but they disbelieve in what was revealed to us although it is the truth confirming what is with them
say why did you kill the prophets of allah if you are believers
and moses came to you with clear signs
then you took the calf for worship after him
and remember when we made a covenant with you and raised the mount saying hold fast to what we have given you and listen to what we have given you and they said ‘ hear and we hear and we are patient ’
and their hearts absorbed the worship of the calf because of their disbelief
say vile is your faith if you are believers
say if you had postponed for death with allah the abode of the hereafter then long for death if you are truthful
but they will never long for it because of what their hands have forwarded
allah is aware of the wrongdoers
and you will find them the most greedy of life even more than the idolaters
each one of them wishes to live a thousand years but he will not remove his reward from them if he were to live a thousand years
and allah is allseer of what they do
say whosoever is an enemy to gabriel he has revealed it down by the permission of allah confirming what was revealed before it and a guidance and glad tidings to the believers
whosoever is an enemy to allah and his angels and his apostles and gabriel and michael then verily allah is an enemy to the disbelievers
and we have sent down to you clear verses and none rejects them except the defiantly disobedient
is it not that whenever they make a covenant a party of them cast it aside
nay but most of them do not believe
and when a messenger came to them from allah confirming that which was with them a party of those who were given the book threw the book of allah behind their backs as if they knew not
and they followed what the devils recited to solomon
it was not solomon who disbelieved but it was not solomon who disbelieved but the devils taught the two angels harut and marut
they learnt that which was not sent down to any enemy but they said “ we are not a trial for the disbelievers ”
and yet they learn from them that they cause separation between the people and the wife of lot
they learnt that they should learn a permission of allah
and they learn that which harms them and profits them not
indeed they knew that whoever purchased it would have purchased in the hereafter and whoever purchased the share of allah
if only they knew
and had they believed and feared allah would have been better if they had been godfearing
o you who believe do not say to the messenger ra ina but say unzurna and listen to us and say unzurna
neither the unbelievers among the people of the book nor the idolaters wish that there should be sent down to you any good from your lord
but allah chooses for his mercy whom he wills
and allah is the owner of great bounty
we abrogate a verse or cause to swallow it to be forgotten we bring a better one verse or similar to it
do you not know that allah is able to do all things
do you not know that to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and besides allah you have no protector or helper
or do you want to question your messenger as moses was questioned before
and whosoever changeth disbelief verily he hath gone astray from the right way
many of the people of the scripture jews and christians wish to turn you back after the truth has become clear to them from their ownselves after the truth has become clear to them
but pardon and overlook until allah brings his command
allah is able to do all things
maintain the prayer and give the zakat
you shall find for yourselves a good deed you shall find it with allah
allah is seer of what ye do
and they say none shall enter paradise except one who is a jew or christian
say bring your proof if you are truthful
nay but whosoever submits his face to allah and he is a doer of good
no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
the jews say the christians are not based on anything on the right religion and the christians say the jews are not grounded on anything
even though they know not the scripture
allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
and who is more unjust than he who prohibits the name of allah and strives for their ruin
it is not for them to enter them except in fear in the world and in the hereafter is a great punishment
and to allah belong the east and the west so wherever you turn there is allah s countenance ’
allah is the embracer the knower
and they say allah has begotten a son
glory be to him
his is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and all are obedient to him
originator of the heavens and the earth
when he decrees a thing he only says to it be and it is
those who do not know say why does allah not speak to us or why does he not speak to us a sign
even before them said the people of old
their hearts resemble each other
we have already shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain
we have sent you with the truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
you will not be questioned about the inmates of hell
and never will the jews be pleased with you nor the christians unless you follow their religion
say ‘ indeed the guidance of allah is the right way ’
and if you were to follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you you would have neither any protector or helper against allah
those to whom we have given the book read it as it should be read and those who believe in it and those who disbelieve in it they are the losers
o children of israel remember my favor which i bestowed upon you and that i preferred you above all beings
and fear a day when no soul will compensate it in its own selves nor will anyone be accepted from it nor will intercession be accepted from it nor will they be helped
and remember when his lord tested abraham with certain words and he fulfilled them
he said “ and i will make you a leader of humanity ”
he said my covenant shall not reach the wrongdoers
and remember when we made the house a place of return for mankind and a place of security
and offer you the earth and pray “ take your place of rest ”
and we inspired abraham and ishmael “ sanctify my house for those who seclude themselves and those who seclude themselves and bow in adoration and prostrate themselves
and remember when abraham said my lord make this city a place of security and provide its people with fruits and believe in god and the last day he said “ my lord ”
but he said to him i shall make him taste a hapless punishment of fire
and when abraham and ishmael were raising the foundations of the house abraham prayed our lord accept this from us
you are the hearer the knower
our lord make us submissive to you and from our progeny a nation submissive to you and show us our rites and show us our rites
you are the gentle the merciful
our lord send among them a messenger from amongst them who recite to them your revelations and teach them the book and wisdom and purify them
you are the almighty the wise ”
and who forsaketh the religion of abraham except one who befooleth himself
we chose him in this world and in the hereafter he will be among the righteous
when his lord said to him “ i have submitted to the lord of the creation ” he said “ i have submitted to the lord of the creation ”
and abraham turned his sons to jacob saying o my sons god has chosen this for you so die not except as muslims
o you jews and christians
what will you worship after me
they said we will worship your god and the god of your fathers abraham ishmael and isaac and jacob and to him we submit
that was a nation that has passed away
their deeds are for you and your deeds are all that you used to do
you will not be questioned about what they used to do
they say be jews or nazarenes and you will be guided
say ‘ we have been exclusively proud to be the creed of abraham the monotheist
say we believe in allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes and jesus and the prophets and what was given to moses and jesus and what was given to moses and jesus and jesus and what
we make no distinction between any of them and to him we submit ”
if they believe in the way you have believed they will turn away but if they turn away then they will be your enemies and allah is the hearer the knower
say ‘ o allah s coloring ’
and who is better than allah
and him do we worship ’
say o muhammad peace be upon him do you dispute with us concerning allah whereas he is our lord and your lord and to us belong our deeds and we are sincere
or do you say that abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the patriarchs were jews or christians say is allah and the case of abraham or is he among us or is he who has guided us
and who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony from allah and allah is not unaware of what ye do
that is a nation that has passed away theirs shall be what they earned and what you earn
you will not be questioned about what they used to do
the foolish among the people will say what has turned them away from the qiblah they formerly observed
say to allah belong the east and the west he guides whom he wills to a straight path
thus we have made you a middle nation that you may be witnesses to mankind and that you may be witnesses over the people
and we made the qiblah which you formerly observed only that we might ascertain those who followed the messenger from him who turn away from him
it was a hard thing except for those whom allah has guided
but god would never let your faith go to waste
we have seen you turning your face towards the heaven and we will surely turn you to a qiblah which will satisfy you
so turn your face towards the sacred mosque
and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it
those who were given the scripture know that it is the truth from their lord
and allah is not unaware of what they do
and if you were to bring to those who were given the book every sign they would not follow your qiblah nor would they follow you then you would be one of the wrongdoers after they were in the least
those to whom we gave the book know him as they recognize their sons
but a party of them conceal the truth knowingly
the truth is from your lord so be not among those who waver
every man is a direction for him
so race in good deeds
wherever you may be allah will bring you together
indeed allah is over all things competent
and wherever you emerge from turn your face towards the sacred mosque
this is the truth from your lord and allah is not unaware of what you do
and wherever you come and turn your face towards the holy mosque and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it and wherever you may be godwary so that you may be guided to the right path so that i may complete my blessings on you and that
even as we sent to you a messenger from among you who recites to you our verses and purifies you and teaches you the book and wisdom and teaches you what you did not know
so remember me i will remember you
give thanks to me and do not be ungrateful towards me
o you who believe seek help through fortitude and prayer and prayer for god is with the patient
and do not say of those who are killed in the way of allah they are dead
nay they are living but you perceive it not
we will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and loss and loss of wealth and fruits
give good news to the patient
who when a misfortune befalls them they say “ we belong to allah and to him we will return ”
they are the ones upon whom are blessings from their lord and mercy and they are the rightly guided
safa and marwa are among the symbols of allah
so whoever performs the house or performs umrah there is no fault in the house of allah and whoever performs umrah between them
and whosoever voluntarily does good then verily allah is ever appreciative knowing
those who conceal the clear signs and guidance we have sent down after we have clarified them to the guidance of allah and the cursers
except those who repent and mend their ways and clarify for them i am the allclement the allmerciful
those who disbelieve and die while they are faithless — it is they who are the curse of allah and of angels and of men combined
they will remain in it forever and their punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
your god is one god there is no god but he the benevolent evermerciful
indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day and the ships that sail in the sea with the rain which allah sends down from the sky and the earth and the dead from the sky and the changing of the
and among the people are those who take to themselves rivals to allah as equals to him
but those who believe are more loving to allah
if only they would see when they see the torment that they will realize that allah is severe in punishment
when those who were followed will disown those who followed themselves and they will see the punishment and the punishment will be cut off from them and their cords
and those who followed will say if only we had another turn to dust then we would disown them as they have disowned us
thus will allah show them their deeds as regrets for them and they will not come to know from the fire
o mankind eat of what is lawful and good and good in the earth and follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan
he is an open enemy to you
he only commandeth you to evil and indecency and that ye should say concerning allah that which ye know not
and when it is said to them follow what allah has revealed they say we found our fathers following even though their fathers had no knowledge nor would they have been guided
the likeness of those who disbelieve is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which is as a thing and a cry unto him
deaf dumb and blind they are deaf therefore they are deaf therefore blinded their hearts
o you who believe eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you and be grateful to allah if it is him that you worship
he has forbidden you the flesh of swine and that which has been slaughtered and blood and that which has been consecrated to other than allah
but whoever is driven by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing it is no sin for him
allah is forgiving merciful
verily those who conceal what allah has sent down of the book and purchase a small gain therewith of which they eat into their bellies nothing but fire
allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them and for them is a painful punishment
they are the people who have bartered away guidance for error and pardon for forgiveness
how constant they are in pursuit of the fire
that is because allah has sent down the book with the truth and those who differ about it are in extreme defiance
righteousness does not consist and listen to it
the good deeds has been revealed to allah and the last day and the angels who believe in allah and the last day and the last day and the orphans and the needy and the beggars and the freeing of their affairs and the prayer and the orphans and
these are the ones who are sincere and it is they who are the godwary
retaliation is prescribed for you in retaliation for the murdered the free man for the slave for female
but if he had given his brother the payment is to be given by mistake let him be with kindness and payment to the poor
this is an alleviation from your lord and mercy
so whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment
o people of understanding there is life for you in order that you may be cautious
prescribed for you when death approaches one of you when death approaches one of you is a bequest he leaves behind wealth and children
this is a duty for those who ward off evil
then whosoever altereth the bequest after he hath heard it the sin thereof shall be upon those who change it
allah is hearer knower
if one fears from the right way of sin then he makes unintentionally and no sin upon him
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who have believed it is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you that you may become righteous
fasting is the fast for a limited number
but if any of you is sick or on a journey then whosoever of you is sick let him fast to the same number of other days
for those who find a ransom to ransom themselves by feeding a needy person
and whosoever volunteers good it is better for him
and that you should fast for it is better for you if you only knew
the month of ramadhan is guidance for mankind and clear evidence that the quran is revealed to the people of the qur an ’ and the criterion of right and wrong
so whoever witnesses it is for him who is sick or on a journey let him fast it is for him who is sick or on a journey s journey
allah desires ease for you and does not want ease for you and that you may complete the number of days and that you may magnify allah for his own accord and that you may be grateful
and when my servants ask you about me i am near to the call of the caller when he calls upon me and i will accept the truth so that they may be guided
permitted for you is intercourse with your wives on the night of the fast
they are clothing for you and you are clothing for them
allah knows that you used to betray yourselves and he has excused you
so eat of the fast by allah and leave your wives and eat of the fast until nightfall and touch you and eat of the fast until nightfall and do not approach the mosques of dawn
these are the bounds of allah so approach them not
thus does allah clarify his signs for people so that they may be godwary
and do not consume each other s wealth unjustly in vanity ’ s wealth ’ and do not consume it to devour the wealth of others wrongfully
they ask you o muhammad about the new moons say these are periods for mankind and for pilgrimage
say ‘ it is not righteousness for the people to approach the periods of hajj ’
enter the houses of the main gate
so enter houses from their doors and fear god haply you will prosper
fight in the way of allah those who fight you but do not transgress the limits and rebellion
and kill them wherever you find them and expel them from where they drove you out
oppression is worse than killing
but do not fight them at almasjidalharam at makkah unless they fight you there
and if they attack you then kill them such is the recompense of the faithless
but if they cease then indeed allah is forgiving and merciful
fight them until there is no more fitnah and until there is acknowledged against allah and if they desist then let the wrongdoers desist know
the sacred month is for the sacred month prohibitions
so whoever transgresses the prohibition of allah then he has assaulted you with like him who transgresses the limits of his own burden
and fear allah and know that allah is with those who fear him
and spend in the way of allah and do not throw yourselves into destruction with your own hands into ruin
allah loveth the doers of good
and fulfil the pilgrimage and umra for allah and if you are prevented then offer the offering reacheth the sacrificial animals
and do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place of sacrifice if he has a sacrifice or a sacrificial offering or a sacrifice or a sacrifice
and when you are secure then whosoever performs umrah let him perform the pilgrimage according to his house
but whoever does not afford to perform the pilgrimage then he shall fast three days during the hajj season
that is for him whose family is not present at the sacred mosque
and fear allah and know that allah is severe in retribution
the pilgrimage is in months wellknown
there is no fault in the one who is minded to perform the pilgrimage nor do you commit an indecency or dispute with one another
and whatever good you do allah knows it
and whatever you do is ahead of the hereafter
provide well for yourselves are godfearing
so fear me o men of understanding
it is no sin for you to seek the bounty of your lord during the hajj season
but when you depart from arafat remember allah at al mash ar alharam
and remember him as he has guided you were before this
then depart from where the people depart and ask allah for forgiveness indeed allah is allforgiving allmerciful
and when you have completed your rites remember allah as you remember your fathers or with a greater remembrance
and among the people is he who says “ our lord give us in this world ”
and among them are some who say our lord give us good in this world and good in the hereafter and save us from the chastisement of the fire
for them is a share of what they have earned
and allah is swift in reckoning
remember allah during counted days
then whosoever hasteneth in two days there is no sin on him and whosoever delayeth the like of him and whosoever delayeth him feareth him and whosoever feareth no sin shall be godfearing
and fear allah and know that unto him ye shall be gathered
and of mankind there is he who charms you concerning it
he calls allah to witness the true man
but he is the best of judges
and when he turns away he strives throughout the land destroying properties and lives in the land and destroy crops
and allah approveth not corruptness
and when it is said to him fear allah arrogance and makes him adhere to sin
gehenna hell shall be enough for him how wretched a cradling
and among mankind is he who sells himself seeking the approval of allah
and allah is kind to his servants
o you who believe enter into islam completely and follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan
do not follow in satan s footsteps ’ he is your manifest enemy
if you lapse back after the clear signs have come to you know that allah is allmighty allwise
do they await anything but that allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds with the angels and the matter would be decided
and to allah all matters are returned
ask the children of israel how many a clear sign we gave them
whoever changes the favor of allah after it has come to him allah is severe in retribution
beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve and they scoff at those who believe
but those who fear allah and do good on the day of resurrection allah gives provisions to whom he wills
mankind were one nation
allah sent prophets to give glad tidings to give them glad tidings and to warn those who were with the truth and to judge between them with the truth that he revealed
but those who were given the book differed between them after the clear proofs had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves
then allah guided those who believed to the truth concerning that which they had differed concerning it
allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
or do you think that you will enter paradise without any experienced in the example of those who passed away before you
they were afflicted by poverty and hardship and ailments befell them until they were shaken with him they said when will the help of allah come to pass
lo verily allah s help is nigh
they ask you about what they spend say whatever wealth you spend say to parents and relatives orphans and the needy and the traveller and the wayfarer and the destitute traveler
and whatever good you do allah is knowing of it
fighting is ordained for you though it is hateful to you
belike ye may hate a thing whereas it is good for you and it is good for you and it may be that ye love a thing which is good for you
allah knows and you do not know
say o muhammad saw o my people
say fighting is a great sin in the sight of allah but it is a great sin and disbelief and disbelief in the sight of allah and disbelief and its expulsion is greater in the sight of allah and alfitnah disbelief
they will not cease to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they can
and whosoever of you turns away from his religion and dies and dies and dies and whose works shall be in vain
they are the people of the fire and they will abide therein forever
indeed those who have believed and those who migrated and waged jihad in the way of allah — it is they who are the losers
they ask you about wine and gambling say in them is great sin and some benefit for men but the greater profits them is greater than their usefulness
but they ask you what they should spend
say what is your opinion
thus does allah clarify his signs for you so that you may reflect
about this world and the next
they ask you about orphans say improvement for them is best
and if you intermix with them they are your brethren
allah knows the dishonest from the dishonest
had allah wished he would have overburdened you
allah is mighty wise
do not marry idolatresses until they embrace faith
a maid servant is better than an idolatress even though you may admire her
and do not marry idolaters until they believe
a believing slave is better than an idolater even though he pleases you
they invite you to the fire while allah calls to paradise and pardon by his leave and he makes clear his ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc to men so that they may take heed
they ask you about menstruation say it is harmful
so approach women during their menstrual periods and do not approach them until they are cleansed themselves then come to you from where allah has commanded you
indeed allah loves those who repent and purify themselves
o you who believe
and you will have a good place for you
and bring your horses close to your own selves
so fear allah and know that to him you will be gathered
give good news to the faithful
do not make allah a hindrance to your oaths and do not make allah s name ’ to your oaths and do not make any obstacle between people
allah is hearer knower
allah does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths but he will take you to task for what your hearts have earned
allah is forgiving clement
those who forswear their wives is a waiting for four months and if they recant god is forgiving and kind
and if they resolve on divorce then know that allah is hearing knowing
and women are divorced women for three periods and three monthly periods
and if he had not created in their faith in allah and in the last day
and their husbands have their husbands desire to take them back to their husbands if they desire reconciliation
and for them is similar to what is due against them
but men have a degree over them
allah is mighty wise
divorce is twice then either honorable retention or release her in a reasonable manner
and it is not lawful for you to take away anything of what you have given them unless they fear that they may be able to keep within the limits of allah
if you fear that there is no fault in them if you fear that they may maintain the limits of allah then either honourably or release them
these are the bounds set by allah
and whoever transgresses the limits of allah such are the zalimun wrongdoers etc
and if he divorces her the third time she shall not be lawful for him after she marries the other if she marries the other husband to keep her under the husband of the other after the wife of allah then they shall be able to keep her under
these are the bounds of allah which he clarifies for people who know
when you have divorced women and they have reached their term either retain them honourably or release them honourably
retain them in order to retain them in order that they transgress not
and whosoever does that has wronged himself
do not take the verses of allah to you
and remember the favor of allah upon you and what he has given you of the book and wisdom
and fear allah and know that allah is allknowing allknower
when you have divorced women and they have reached their term do not debar men from marrying their husbands when they are honourably
this instruction is an admonition for him who believeth in allah and the last day
that is better for you and purer
allah knows and you know not
mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years and whosoever desires the suckling to fulfil their adornment
it is for the father to provide for them and clothe them honourably
no person shall be charged with more than he can bear
no mother shall be harmed her child neither father for his child nor child
and on the father s heir is incumbent on the father
and if they both desire weaning by mutual consent and consultation there is no fault in them
and if you desire to give suck for your children then there is no fault in you if you give them a compensation that you may give her release
and fear allah and know that allah is allseer of what you do
and those of you who die and leave wives behind they shall wait keeping themselves for four months and ten days
then when they have fulfilled their term there is no blame upon you for what they have done with themselves honourably
and allah is allaware of what you do
there is no fault in you if you commit a sin in proposing to divorce women or to make them in secret
allah knows that you will be thinking about them
but do not promise them secretly unless you speak something proper
and do not consummate the marriage until the term prescribed is prescribed for you
and know that allah knows what is in your souls so beware of him
and know that allah is forgiving and forbearing
there is no fault in divorcing you if you divorce women while you have not touched them nor appointed them a dowry for them
and provide for them honourably a rich according to his means and the poor according to his capability a according to his capability a duty on the straitened doers of good
and if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have appointed for them a marriageportion then onehalf of what you have given them unless they forego the marriage pays the marriage contract foregoes it or the marriage contract foregoes it
and to forego it is nearer to piety
and do not forget graciousness between you
allah is seer of what ye do
guard your prayers and the middle prayer and stand before allah
but if you fear danger then pray standing or danger then pray to allah when you are secure remember he taught you what you did not know
those of you who die leaving wives behind their wives shall bequeath for a year without turning to the wives of the heritage
and if they leave you do not find for them in their own selves then they will not find within themselves any relation with themselves in the sin of what they do
allah is mighty wise
and for divorced women maintenance should be a provision honourable for the godfearing
thus does allah clarify his signs for you so that you may understand
have you not thought of those who went forth from their homes in thousands fearing death and they were thousands to return to them
indeed allah is gracious to mankind but most people do not give thanks
fight in the way of allah and know that allah is hearing and knowing
who is he that will lend allah a good loan and he will multiply it for him manifold
and allah tightens it and unto him you will return
moses said to the children of israel when they said to his messenger “ appoint a king for us a king and we will fight in the way of allah ”
he said would ye refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you
they said why should we not fight in allah s way when we have been driven out from our homes and our children
but when fighting was prescribed for them they turned away except a few of them
and allah is allaware of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
their prophet said to them “ god has appointed saul to be king over you ”
they said how can he have kingship over us when we have been more deserving of wealth and children
he said “ god has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge
and allah bestoweth his sovereignty on whom he wills
allah is allembracing allknowing
their prophet said to them indeed the sign of his kingship is that you will come to know the ark wherein there is no fault in you from your lord and the house of aaron and the house of moses and aaron
it will be borne by the angels
in that is a sign for you if you are believers
and when talut saul set out with his army he said allah will test you with a river
whoever drinks from it — it is not for him who dies up and follows it — he is not of me except one who scoops up the goblet of me
but they drank thereof all save a few of them
then when he crossed it he said to his enemy “ we have no strength today ”
but those who knew that they would meet allah said how many a small company has overcome a small band defeated
and allah is with the patient
and when they went forth against jalut and his hosts they said our lord pour out on us patience fortitude and give us victory over the disbelieving people
so they routed them by the leave of allah and da ud between them
david slew goliath and god taught him the kingdom and wisdom and taught him the <unk> of the past
and if allah were to do not favour upon the people but allah is the forgiver of the alamin mankind jinns and all mankind
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you in truth
you are one of the messengers
and we have preferred some of the messengers above others
of these are some who fought and some he raised others in rank
we gave jesus son of mary clear signs and strengthened him with the spirit of purity gabriel
had allah willed he would have succeeding them with clear signs and they would not have fought against one another after the clear signs had come to them
so they differed among themselves some believed in allah s religion but some of them believed so some of them disbelieved
had allah willed they would not have fought against one another but allah does whatever he pleases
o you who believe spend of what we have provided you before the day comes in which there will be no trade nor friendship nor intercession
and the disbelievers they are the wrongdoers
allah
there is no god except he the living the eternal
neither slumber nor sleep overtake him
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
who is there that shall intercede with him except with his permission
he knows what is before them and what is behind them
they do not comprehend anything of his knowledge except what he wills
his kursi extends over the heavens and the earth
and the <unk> of him is not one
he is the most high the great
no compulsion is there in religion
rectitude is made distinct from error
so whosoever disbelieves in allah and believes in allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold which he has grasped a firm handhold
allah is hearing knowing
allah is the wali protector or helper to those who believe he brings them out from darkness into light
as for those who disbelieve their auliya supporters helpers etc they bring them out of light into darkness
they are the people of the fire and they will abide therein forever
have you not considered him who argued with abraham about his lord because allah had given him sovereignty
when abraham said my lord is he who gives life and causes death he said i give life and cause death
abraham said “ god brings the sun from the east ” then you bring it from the west
allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
or like him who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin and he who had killed the roofs of a township which had fallen
he said ‘ how can allah revive him ’ he said ‘ how long have you remained dead ’
he said “ perhaps i remained a day or part of a day ”
he said “ you have stayed up for a hundred years and look at your food and drink ”
look at your donkey who had remained behind
and we have made you a sign for the people
and look at the bones how we raise them up and clothe them with flesh
when it became clear to him he said i know that allah is able to do all things
and remember when abraham said my lord show me how you revive the dead he said ‘ do you not believe ’
he said yes but i ask for my heart s assurance
he said take four birds and twist them and then place a part of them on every hill then call them to you they will come rushing to you
and know that allah is allmighty allwise
the likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of allah is like a grain of corn which produces seven ears and every ear yields a hundred grains
allah multiplies to whom he wills
and allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs allknower
those who spend their wealth in the way of allah and do not follow their spending with their lord in the way of reward
no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury
and allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs allknower
o you who believe do not invalidate your charities with reminders of his wealth and injury like him who spendeth his wealth to the people of the hereafter and believes in allah and the last day
his likeness is that of a rock covered with soil a downpour which is washed away from dust and a torrent smites it
they have no power over anything of what they have earned
allah does not guide the disbelieving people
and those who spend their wealth seeking the approval of allah and strives for them is like a garden of rain and if they grow in it then it yields its yield rain falls upon it and if it yields its harvest is a twofold rain
allah is seeing of what you do
would any of you have a garden of palm trees and vines with rivers flowing underneath which rivers flow and all kinds of fruit in it and old age has smitten him with a fiery whirlwind and a fiery whirlwind
thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations haply ye may reflect
o you who believe spend of the good things which you have earned and from the earth which we produced for you from the earth
and do not pick the inferior of you to take away from it except that you can not know
and know that allah is rich free of all wants and all wants to allah
satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality
and allah promises you his forgiveness
allah is knower indulgent
he gives wisdom to whom he wills
and he who has been given wisdom in it has been given him
but none pays heed except those possessed of minds
whatever you spend or whatever vow you spend allah knows it is they who are the wrongdoers
if you give alms openly that is best but if you hide it and give them a good loan to the needy it will atone for some of your sins
allah is aware of what you do
o prophet muhammad peace be upon him is not a guide to your lord
allah guideth them not but a guide
whatever good you spend for yourselves you will be repaid except with allah
and whatever good you spend will be repaid for you and you will not be wronged
the charities are for the poor who are straitened for the sake of allah and who are straitened in the land
you will recognize them by their features
they do not ask any thing of their own earnings
and whatever good you spend allah knows it
those who spend their wealth by night and day secretly and openly by day secretly and openly their reward is with their lord
no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
those who devour usury will not rise up except as the one whom satan has deranged by his touch prostrates saying ‘ trade is just like usury ’
but allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury
so whoever accepts from his lord will receive a reward and his matter will be made with what he has forbidden and he will perish
to allah rests the outcome of him
but he who brings the punishment of the fire they will abide therein
allah effaces usury and nurtures charity
allah loveth not any ingrate sinner
those who believe and do good deeds and perform the prayer and give alms their reward with their lord
no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
o believers fear allah and give up what remains due to you if you are believers
and if you do not then take notice of war against you from allah and his messenger
but if you repent you will not be wronged in your principal nor will you be wronged
and if he should be in difficulties then deferment until easiness
but if you forego it is better for you if you only knew
and fear a day when you will be returned to allah and every soul will be paid in full what it has earned and they will not be wronged
o you who believe when you contract a debt for a specified term write it down
let a scribe write it in justice between you
let no scribe refuse to write as god has taught him
let him write and let the debtor dictate and let him fear allah his lord and diminish not anything of it
but if the debtor is mentally deficient or weak or weak or unable to dictate then let him dictate in his charge dictate and let him dictate in his charge dictate
if two men are not available then a man of two women who are truthful
and if there be no dispute concerning him then let the witnesses refuse to call when they are in charge of the prophets when they are not invited
and do not be weary to write it down whether you contract a contract with allah is better for you and more suitable for your witnesses
but there is no sin upon you if you live for a specified term and do not write it down for you
if you do it harm in you then consume it in you if you do harm
and fear allah
and allah teaches you
allah is knower of all things
and if you are on a journey and can not find a scribe then let him fear allah his lord his trust and let him fear allah his lord
and do not conceal testimony
and whosoever hideth it verily his heart is sinful
allah is aware of what you do
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
whether you reveal what is within your hearts or hide it allah will bring you to account for it
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
allah is able to do all things
the messenger has believed in what has been revealed to him from his lord and so do the believers
each one believes in allah and his angels his books and his messengers saying we differentiate between no one of his messengers
they say we hear and we obey
our lord forgive us our sins and toward you is the return ”
allah does not charge a soul except with a burden
and whosoever worketh righteously it shall be for himself and he shall bear the consequence thereof
our lord take us not to task if we forget or make mistake
our lord do not impose blame upon us for they have forgotten us
our lord do not burden us with a burden for which you have no strength to lay down upon us
our lord
pardon us and forgive us and have mercy upon us
help us against the faithless lot ’
alif lam meem
allah la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he the living the eternal
he has sent down to you the book with the truth confirming what was revealed before it
and he sent down the torah and the gospel
aforetime for a guidance to mankind and he sent down the criterion
those who disbelieve in the signs of allah will have a painful punishment
allah is mighty able to requite the wrong
nothing is hidden from allah in the earth or in the heaven
it is he who fashions you in the wombs as he wills
there is no god except he the almighty the wise
it is he who has sent down to you the book that are clear verses and those who are in the book of the book are some who are unspecific
as for those in whose hearts is deviation in which there is discord in the breasts seeking to follow its interpretation
but none knows its interpretation except allah
and those firmly rooted in knowledge say we believe therein all of them are men of understanding
our lord grant us not to deviate after you have guided us and bestow mercy from your presence
grant us mercy from you are the embracing giver
our lord verily thou shalt gather mankind together in a day whereof there is no doubt
indeed allah does not break his promise ’
the unbelievers neither their riches nor their children shall avail them in the least against allah
they will be fuel for the fire
like the behavior of pharaoh and those before them
they belied our revelations
so allah seized them for their sins
and allah is severe in chastising
say to those who disbelieve you shall be overcome and gathered together to hell an evil restingplace
and there has certainly come to you a sign in the two armies that met in combat
they were not able to seduce him but the faithless expelled from the way of allah
they will be three hundred years with three thousand years
so when the believers were enveloped by their number
or those who disbelieve according to what they say
in this is indeed a lesson for those who fear
beautified for mankind is the love of gold and silver and branded horses and cattle and plantations
these are the enjoyments of the worldly life but allah with him is the best return
say shall i tell you of something better than that
for those who fear god and follow the straight path will be gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein forever and will be pure spouses and allah s pleasure ’
and allah is allseer of his slaves
those who say our lord we have believed so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the fire
the patient and the truthful and the reverent and the reverent and the seekers of the dawns
allah is witness there is no god except him
the angels and the learning of learning and the witnessed and the grand throne there is no god except him the almighty the wise
the true religion with allah is islam
those to whom we gave the book was given differed only after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves
and whoever disbelieves in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah then verily allah is swift in reckoning
so if they argue with you say i have submitted myself to allah and so have those who follow me
and say to those who were given the book and the arabs have you surrendered yourselves to allah
if they surrender they are rightly guided but if they turn away then your duty is only to convey the message
allah is seeing of his servants
those who disbelieve in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah and kill the prophets wrongfully and slay the upholders of justice and slay the upholders of justice
they are the ones whose works have failed in this world and in the hereafter and they have no saviors
have you not seen those who have been given a portion of the book of allah to judge between them
then a party of them turned away and they are backsliders
that is because they say the fire will not touch us except for a limited number of days
they have been misled by the lies they fabricated and have deluded them
how will it be when we gather them together on the day when a certain day when their faces will be completed in full and every soul will be repaid to what it has earned and they will not be wronged
say o allah owner of sovereignty
you give sovereignty to whom you will and strip without any you wish to whomever you will
in your hand is the good
you cause the night to enter into the day and you cause the day to enter into the night
and you bring forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living
and you give sustenance to whom you will without reckoning
the believers should not take the unbelievers for friends instead of believers
and whoever does not wrong with allah unless he does not have a covenant from them
and to allah is the final return of him
to allah is the return
say whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it allah knows it
he knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
allah is able to do all things
on the day when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it has earned and all that it has done of evil it will wish that it has done of evil and distance between it and that day it will wish that there were a far distance
allah warns you to beware of disobeying him and allah is gentle with his worshipers
say if you love allah follow me then allah will love you and forgive you your sins
allah is forgiving merciful
say obey allah and the messenger
but if they turn away then allah does not like the faithless
indeed allah chose adam and noah and the family of abraham and the house of imran above all mankind
offspring one of the other
allah is hearer knower
remember when the wife of imran said my lord i have vowed to you what is in my womb consecrated to be dedicated
accept it from me
you are the hearer the knower
and when she was delivered she said my lord
i have given birth to a girl ”
and allah was well aware of what she gave birth to the male is not like the female
i have named her mary and her offspring to you from satan the accursed
her lord accepted her with a gracious reception and made her grow in a care of zechariah
whenever zachariah went to her in the sanctuary he found her supplied with food
he said o maryam whence is this from thee she said this is from allah
indeed allah provides for whomever he wills without any reckoning
thereupon zachariah prayed to his lord saying lord give me a goodly offspring from your presence
you hear all prayers
and the angels called out to him while he stood praying in the sanctuary allah gives you glad tidings of john yahya john confirming the word from allah who will confirm a word from him and chaste a prophet of pure word from allah the righteous
he said my lord how shall i have a son when old age has overtaken me and my wife is barren
he said thus does allah will bring it out
he said my lord appoint for me a sign for you is that you shall not speak to people for three days except by gesture
and remember your lord much and glorify him with praise and evening ’
and remember when the angels said o maryam mary has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above all the women of the world
o mary be obedient to your lord prostrate and bow with those who bow in worship
these are accounts of the unseen which we reveal to you
you were not present with them when they cast lots with their pens and their brother mary who were not with them when they disputed with mary
when the angels said o mary allah gives you glad tidings of a word from him the messiah jesus son of mary illustrious in this world and the next and the prophet jesus and eisa the son of maryam illustrious in this world to come and to allah is
he will speak to the people in the cradle and in adulthood and will be one of the righteous
she said “ my lord how can i have a child when no man has touched me he said “ my lord ”
when he decrees a thing he only says to it be and it is
and he will teach him the book and wisdom and the torah and the gospel
and will make him a messenger to the children of israel saying i am a messenger
and i have not seen you with a sign from your lord
i heal the blind and the leper and quicken the dead by allah s leave
i heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead by allah s leave
i will inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses
surely in that is a sign for you if you are believers
and i am going to confirm the torah and to make lawful to you some of what was forbidden to you and to make some of the prophets from your lord
so fear allah and obey me
allah is my lord and your lord so worship him
that is the straight path
then when jesus perceived their unbelief he said who will be my helpers in the way of allah
the disciples said we are helpers of allah
we believe in allah
bear witness that we are submitters muslims
our lord we believe in what you revealed and follow the messenger
inscribe us among those who bear witness
and they devised and allah devised and allah is the best of devisers
when allah said o jesus i will take you and raise you to myself and raise you to me from myself and purify you and those who disbelieve till the day of resurrection
then to me is your return whereat i will judge between you concerning that over which you used to differ
as for those who disbelieve i will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the next and they will have no saviors
but as for those who believe and do good works he will pay them in full their rewards
allah does not like the wrongdoers
this is what we recite to you of the verses and the wise reminder
indeed the likeness of jesus with allah is like that of adam he created him from dust then he said to him be and he was
this is the truth from your lord
so be not of those who doubt it
and whoever disputes with you concerning the knowledge after the knowledge has come to you say “ come let us call our sons and your women and your sons and your women and your women and your women and your women who will fight earnestly ”
this is the true story
allah there is no god but he
allah is mighty wise
but if they turn away then know that allah is knower of the corrupters
say o people of the scripture jews and christians come to us from your presence and we are not a just one of us to come to us with the people of the book
that is because they say “ that they worship besides allah ” and do not worship besides allah
and if they turn away then say “ we have submitted ourselves to allah ”
o people of the scripture why dispute about abraham
why do you argue about abraham when the torah and the gospel were not revealed until after him
you are those who dispute concerning what you have disputed but why do you argue about things you do not know
allah knows and you know not
abraham was neither a jew nor a christian
he was not a muslim to allah a hanif and he was not of the idolaters
indeed the people who are near abraham are the beloved of abraham and those who followed him and this prophet muhammad saw and those who believe in him
allah is the guardian of the believers
a party of the people of the book wish to lead you astray but they do not mislead anyone except themselves but they perceive it not
o people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in the signs of allah when you yourselves are witnesses
o people of the book why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know
a party of the people of the book say believe in what has been revealed to the unbelievers at the beginning of the day and reject it at the end of the day
perhaps they turn away from the believers
say “ guidance is allah s guidance ’ upon you why do you not believe if you are given the like of what allah has given you before your lord has given you
say o muhammad saw o my people
say the bounty of allah is in his hand
and allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs allknower
he selects for his mercy whomsoever he will
allah is possessor of great bounty
and among the people of the book there are some who if you entrust him with a quintal and if you entrust him with a dinar he will restore it to you and you will not return it to you unless you stand persistently over it
that is because they say we have no obligation on the nonjews of their saying is there that they speak untruth about allah while they know it
nay but whosoever keepeth his covenant and feareth allahthen verily allah loveth the godfearing
those who exchange the covenant of allah and their oaths for a small price will have no share in the hereafter
allah will neither speak to them nor look at them on the day of resurrection nor will he purify them
a painful punishment awaits them
and among them are some who distort the scripture with their tongues so that you may think it is with the book when it is from the people of the book who read the book
and they have made their portion of the book say it is not allah s
and it is not the same for allah
and say “ god is this ”
they have rejected falsehood and tongues as a lie against allah
it is not for a human that allah should grant him the book and wisdom and prophethood and then he said to men be my servants instead of allah
rather he would say be you teaching men of the scripture and the teachings you teach the teachings of the scripture
nor would he order you to take the angels and prophets for lords
would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to allah
and recall what time allah took the covenant of the prophets saying inasmuch confirming that which i have given you prophets and then confirming that which is with you and afterward confirming that which is with you and come to believe in him and help him and help him
he said “ and accept faith in my commitment ”
he said “ then do stand up and i am witness with you ”
so whosoever turns away after that then they are the transgressors
do they desire other than the religion of allah whereas to him submits whosoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and unto him they will be returned
say we believe in allah and in what has been revealed to abraham ishmael isaac jacob and the tribes and the prophets from their lord and jesus and the prophets and the prophets and the prophets from their offspring and what was revealed to abraham and jesus and to
we make no distinction between any of them and to him we submit ”
and whoever seeks a religion other than islam it will not be accepted from him and he will be among the losers in the hereafter
how will allah guide a people who disbelieved after they believed and bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs had come to them
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
those their recompense is that upon them is the curse of allah and of angels and of men combined
they will abide therein
their punishment will not be lightened nor will they be reprieved
except those who repent after that and reform allah is allforgiving allmerciful
those who disbelieve after having believed and then increase in disbelief their repentance will not be accepted from them and they are the ones who are astray
indeed those who disbelieve and die while they are faithless the whole earth will not be accepted from any one of them would be accepted from it and they will not be accepted from it
for them is a painful punishment and they will have no saviors
you will not attain righteousness until you spend of what you love
whatever you spend god is aware of it
all food was lawful to the children of israel except what israel had been revealed before the torah was revealed to him
say bring the torah and recite it if you are truthful
then whosoever fabricateth after this such will invent a lie against allah such are the wrongdoers
say allah speaketh truth
so follow the religion of abraham the upright who was not of the idolaters
the first house established for mankind was that at bekka blessed and a guidance for all the nations
in it are clear signs of abraham s station ’
and whosoever entereth it shall be secure
and whosoever is laden with the pilgrimage to allah shall be able to make his breast to go to the house he who is able to find a way of duty to allah
allah is independent of all creatures
say o people of the scripture why do you disbelieve in the verses of allah when allah is witness to what you do
say o people of the scripture why do you bar from the way of allah seeking to make it crooked when you yourselves are witnesses to it
and allah is not unaware of what you do
o believers if you obey a party of the people of the book they will turn you back after you have believed after you have believed
how can you disbelieve while to you are recited the verses of allah and his messenger muhammad saw are recited to you
and whosoever holds fast to allah he verily is guided unto a straight path
o you who have believed fear allah as muslims and do not die except as muslims
and hold fast to the bond of allah all together and do not scatter you and remember allah s favour ’ upon you
then he brought you out of his grace and hearts so you became brethren
and you were on the brink of a pit of fire and he saved you from it
thus does allah clarify his signs for you so that you may be guided
and let there be a party of you who invite to the right religion and forbid what is wrong and forbid what is odious
these are the successful
and be not like those who became divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them
for them is a great punishment
on the day when some faces will be whitened and some faces will be blackened “ you disbelieve after your belief ”
so taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve ’
but as for those whose faces are whitened they shall be in allah s mercy therein they shall dwell forever
these are the verses of allah we recite them to you
allah does not want injustice for the creatures
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and to him all matters are returned
you are the best nation you enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and forbid what is wrong
had the people of the scripture believed it would have been better for them
among them are some who believe but most of them are transgressors
they will not hurt you except for harm
and if they fight you they will turn away then they will not be helped
wherever they are found abasement shall be stamped upon them except with a rope from allah and they shall be a rope from the people and they shall be drawn on themselves indignation from allah
that is because they disbelieved in the signs of allah and killed the prophets unjustly and killed the prophets unjustly
that is because they disobeyed and were transgressors
they are not alike
among the people of the book is a community that stand firm in devotion to the verses of allah and prostrate themselves before him
they believe in allah and the last day and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to the good
these are among the righteous
and whatever good they do will not be denied it
allah knows the cautious
as for those who disbelieve neither their wealth nor their children will avail them aught against allah
they are the people of the fire and they will abide therein forever
the likeness of what they spend in this life of the world is like a freezing wind that smites it and destroys it
allah does not wrong them but they wronged themselves
o ye who believe take not for friends instead of your own friends
they spare nothing to ruin you they yearn to ruin you
hatred has already appeared to you from their mouths but what their hearts conceal is greater
we have made plain to you the revelations if you are truthful
indeed you are the ones who love you but they do not love you and you believe in all the scriptures of the book
when they meet you they say we believe but when they are alone they bite their fingers into rage
say die in your rage
allah is knower of that which is in the breasts
if a good befalls you it grieves them but if some evil overtakes you they rejoice at it
but if you remain patient and godfearing their guile will not harm you at all
allah is aware of what they do
and remember when you left your family in the morning of the believers at their stations for the battle of uhud
allah is hearer knower
when two parties of you almost faltered but god was their protector
in allah let all the believers put their trust
allah had already given you victory at badr when you were weak at badr
so fear allah that you may be grateful
and recall what time thou saidst to the believers sufficieth it not unto you that your lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down
yes if you are patient and cautious and they will come upon you suddenly and suddenly your lord will reinforce you with five thousand marked angels rank
allah made it not except as a glad tidings and so that your hearts might be comforted
victory comes only from allah the almighty the wise
that he may cut off a part of the faithless or suppress them so that they retreat disappointed
it is not for you to decide whether he turns towards them or punishes them or punishes them for they are the wrongdoers
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
allah is forgiving merciful
o you who believe do not consume usury doubled and consume not usury
so fear allah that you may prosper
and beware of the fire gotten ready for the infidels
and obey allah and the messenger that you may obtain mercy
and hasten to forgiveness from your lord and a garden whose breadth is as the heavens and the earth prepared for the godfearing
who spend in the way of allah and restrain anger and forgive those who are patient
allah loves the doers of good
and those who when they commit an indecency or wrong themselves remember allah and plead for forgiveness
who can be more powerful than allah
and they do not persist in their doings knowingly
their reward is forgiveness from their lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever
how excellent is the reward of the workers
many honourable words have passed before you
so travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell those who denied the truth
this is a proclamation to the people and a guidance and a mercy for the godfearing
do not lose heart lest they are smitten or grieve
you will be the superior if you are believers
if a wound has touched you a similar wound has touched you
that is how we make this alternation of the people and that god may know those who believe and take the light into being borne by god and those who are firm in the way of god
and that allah may prove those who believe and destroy the disbelievers
or do you think that you will enter paradise without allah has not yet tested those of you who are patient
you were longing for death before you met it
now you have seen it before your eyes
muhammad is but a messenger
messengers have passed away before him
if he dies or is slain will you turn back on your heels
and he who turns back on his heels will not harm allah at all
but god will reward the thankful
no soul can die except by allah s ’ leave
it is a determined time
and whoever desires a reward in this world we will give him of it and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter we will give him thereof
and we will reward the thankful
how many a prophet fought alongside him
they did not falter for what befell them in the way of allah nor did they weaken nor did they weaken
allah loves the steadfast
and their words were only that they said “ our lord forgive us our sins and our excesses established us our excesses and give us victory over the disbelieving people ”
so allah gave them the reward of this world and the excellent reward of the hereafter
allah loves the doers of good
o you who believe if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you back on your heels and you will turn back on the earth
nay allah is your maula patron lord helper and protector etc and he is the best of helpers
we will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they attribute to allah partners
their refuge is the fire and what an evil resting place of the wrongdoers
allah has fulfilled his promise to you when you were slaying them
but allah saved you from his enemies and disputed with his signs and desire to sit in the matter and to dispute with you
then he turned you away from them that he might test you
but he has forgiven you
allah is gracious to the believers
and remember when you were fleeing from the rear and he turned you away from grief and he rewarded you with grief for grief and grief for what you missed opportunity for missed and afflictions of grief that you missed evil deeds and afflictions
and allah is allaware of what you do
then after grief he sent down security for you
one of them was only a section of his own sect saying ‘ this is what we have been fabricating about allah ’
say “ god s is the affair of god ”
they hide within themselves what they reveal to you they say if we had not been killed anything they would have been killed here
say even if you were to enter houses other than slaying your home and would have gone forth to the places of worship those who had been slain would have gone forth to their places in order that allah knows what is in your hearts and allah knows what
those of you who turned away on the day when the two armies met satan made them slip because of some of what they used to earn
but allah has forgiven them indeed allah is allforgiving allforbearing
o you who believe do not say of their brothers who disbelieved and say to their brothers who had been travelling in the land or fighting in their homes they would not have died nor been killed
so that allah may cause it to swallow a cause of regret in their hearts
allah revives and causes to die
and allah is allseer of what you do
if you are slain in the way of allah or die forgiveness from allah and mercy are better than what they hoard
if you die or are killed before allah you will be gathered
it was by allah s mercy that you were gentle to them and you would surely have scattered from them
and if you had been rude and harsh for them you would have found much fault in you
so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter of allah
allah loveth those who put their trust in him
if allah helps you none can overcome you
but if he fails you who is there to help you after him
and in allah let the believers put their trust
it is not for any prophet to take illegally a prophet
whoever betrays taking unlawfully will find his taking on the day of resurrection
then every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned and they shall not be wronged
is he who pursues the pleasure of allah like him who has incurred the wrath of allah and whose refuge is hell an evil restingplace
they are in varying grades with allah
allah sees all that they do
allah has indeed sent down a grace upon the believers when he sent down to them his messages purifying them and teaching them the book and wisdom and to teach them a messenger
they were in clear error
and if you had a disaster smote you until when a calamity strikes you they said where is this but when an enemy has come to you
say ‘ this is from your own selves ’
indeed allah is over all things competent
what befell you on the day when the two armies met was by allah s leave that he might test the believers
and that he might know those who played the hypocrite
and it was said to them come fight in the way of allah or defend yourselves
they said if we knew that fighting would be better than yours
they were nearer to disbelief that day than they were saying with their mouths what is not in their hearts
and allah knows best what they hide
those who said about their brothers while they themselves sat at home and they say to their brothers had they obeyed us they would not have been slain if you are truthful
think not of those who are slain in the way of allah as dead
nay they are alive with their lord
rejoicing in what allah has bestowed upon them of his bounty and rejoicing for those who have not yet joined them nor have they any fear nor shall they grieve
they rejoice in the favor of allah and his favor and grace and that allah wasteth not the hire of the believers
those who answered the call of allah and the messenger after the wound had smitten them for those who answered the virtuous and those who did good deeds and feared allah is a great reward
those who were told the people said the people have gathered against you so fear them but it increased them in faith and they said god is the best of devisers
so they returned with grace and bounty from allah untouched by no evil
allah is the owner of great bounty
it is satan who frightens you of his allies
so fear them not but fear me if you are true believers
and do not be grieved by those who rush into disbelief
they will not harm god in the least god does not give them any share in the hereafter
for them is a great punishment
those who buy disbelief at the price of faith will not harm allah at all
for them is a painful punishment
and let not those who disbelieve think that the rein we give them is good for them
we only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness
they will have a humiliating punishment
allah will not leave the believers in your state until he will distinguish the bad state till he separates from the evil of the good
and allah will not let you know the unseen
but allah chooseth of his messengers whom he will
so believe in allah and his messengers
but if you believe and practice piety then there is a great reward for you
and let not those who are miserly from allah that which allah has bestowed upon them of his bounty think that it is better for them
nay it is worse for them that which they covetously withheld their hands on the day of resurrection
to allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth
and allah is allaware of what you do
allah has heard the statement of those who said “ allah is poor and we are rich ”
we will record what they said and their killing of the prophets wrongfully and their killing of the prophets unjustly and say “ taste the punishment of the burning ”
that is for what your hands have forwarded and allah is not unjust to his slaves
allah has commanded us that we should not believe in the messenger until he brings us a sacrifice to fire they said “ bring us a clear signs before me ”
why then did you kill them if you are truthful
if they call you lies they impugned you before you who were given the clear signs and the scriptures and the book enlightening
every soul will taste death
you will be paid your wages on the day of resurrection
whoever is swayed from the fire and admitted to paradise has won
the life of this world is but a merchandise of vanity
you will be tested in your possessions and your selves and you will hear much abuse from those who were given the book before you and from those who were given the book before you
but if you endure and fear god then that is indeed a decisive matter
and remember when allah took compact with those who were given the book saying you shall not make it clear to mankind and hide it and they shall not hide it except a small price
evil is what they buy
do not think that those who rejoice in what they have perpetrated and love to be praised for what they have not done think they have not done in the hereafter
a painful punishment awaits them
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and allah is able to do all things
indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day are signs for those of understanding
those who remember allah standing sitting and reclining on their sides and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth and say our lord you have not created this in vain
glory be to thee
save us from the chastisement of the fire
our lord whomsoever thou makest into the fire thou wilt have abased and the evildoers shall have no helpers
our lord we have heard a caller calling to faith saying believe in your lord and we have believed
our lord forgive us our sins and expiate from us our misdeeds and make us die with the pious
our lord give us what you promised us through your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of resurrection indeed you never break your promise ”
their lord answered them i shall not waste the work of any worker among you whether male or female or the female you have a female
you are one of another
and those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes and were persecuted who emigrated and were driven out their homes and were killed in my cause and suffered to help them and i shall admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow
and allah with him is the excellent reward
do not let the unbelievers in the land delude you
a brief enjoyment
then their refuge shall be hell and what an evil destination
but those who fear their lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever
the gift of allah is better for the pious
and among the people of the book there are some who believe in allah and what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to them they do not exchange their lives in the verses of allah s verses ’
they will have their reward with their lord
allah is swift in reckoning
o you who believe be patient and persevere and be patient in the cause of allah so that you may be successful
o mankind fear your lord who created you from one soul and from it created its mate and from it he created many men and women
fear allah in whose name you ask one another and the wombs
indeed allah is ever over you a watcher
give the orphans their property and do not substitute the needy
do not exchange your wealth for the orphans nor consume it with your wealth
and if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphans then marry the women that you may be able to marry d the women who are equitable then marry the women who are not masters marry them and that you may marry the orphans and the
that is more suitable that you may not incline to it
and give women their dowries graciously
but if they willingly forego it then consume it with pleasure then consume it with satisfaction
do not give the orphaned your wealth to which allah has given you and clothe you with their property
and provide them with food and clothe them with kindness
and test the orphans until they reach the age of marrying their property and if you apprehend them mature of mind their property then they are not aware
and do not consume it excessively and hastily it is likely to withhold its property
and whosoever is rich let him abstain from his kindred and he is poor let him be aware of what is in whose hand is acceptable
and when you release their property to them take witnesses for them
sufficient is allah as a reckoner
for men is a share of what their parents and kinsmen leave behind and women have a share in what their parents and relatives leave behind and much is a fixed share in the heritage
and when the distribution of orphans and almasakin the needy and the wayfarer and speak to them thereout and speak to them kindly
and let those fear they should fear their offspring and let them fear allah and let them be afraid of that they should be afraid of their lord
verily those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully devour the fire in their bellies and they will roast in the blaze
allah charges you concerning your children for the male is like the share of two females
if there are siblings among them a deceased has siblings they will have twothirds of what he has no share in the heritage
and if there is only one she gets onehalf
and for each of his parents and his parents and his parents and the inheritance if he has no child then for him is his mother and his mother appertaineth the third and if he has no child
and if you have siblings to know that he has siblings a mother s mother is one fourth of his mother
and it is not for a man to die or part of that which you have made known
these shares are better for you
allah is allknowing allwise
and if you leave what your wives leave behind you will have no child if they have children of bequest they leave after any bequest they have bequeathed or debt
and if you leave any one of them you leave after any bequest you leave any bequest you shall have a child for you
and a speaker from among you is a fourth of the inheritance
and if a man dies and a woman is not a child but a sister of inheritance or a sister of his sister is a sixth of the inheritance
but if they are more siblings they share onethird
and that is a commandment from allah and after him have been made to die and thereafter allah will bind
allah is knower indulgent
these are the bounds set by allah
whosoever obeys allah and his messenger he will admit him into gardens underneath which rivers flow to abide therein and that is the great success
and whosoever disobeys allah and his messenger and transgresses his bounds he will admit him into the fire and he will have a humiliating punishment
as for those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse against them four witnesses from among you
and if they testify confine them to death or slaughter them until death takes them for a way
and the two of you commit indecency punish them both
but if they repent and improve then let them alone
allah is the relenting the merciful
allah accepts only from those who commit evil and ignorance and then quickly repent soon those who repent
allah is allknowing allwise
but repentance is not available for those who commit evils until when death approaches one of them he says i repent nor of those who die while they are faithless
for them we have prepared a painful punishment
o you who believe it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their compulsion
and do not make difficulties for them to take away from them unless you commit a flagrant indecency for them
and live with them in kindness
it may be that you dislike something in it it may be that you dislike something which allah has ordained in them
and if you desire to replace a wife in another and you have given one of them a qintar 98 841 6 lbs do not take back from it
would you take it back by way of calumny and manifest sin
how can you take it back when you have taken it back from each other and they have taken a firm covenant
and do not marry women whom your fathers married unless it was lewd evil and an evil way
forbidden unto you are your mothers your daughters and your sisters your sisters and your brethren and your mother s sisters and your brethren and your brethren who nursed you with your wives and your stepdaughters and your stepdaughters in the same way of your wives and your stepdaughters
but if you do not find to go back there is no sin upon you for you
and also forbidden are the wives of your sons who have sprung from your loins and to take to you two sisters together except what is already past
allah is forgiving merciful
and wedded women are those whom your right hands own hands own hands own selves
lawful to you are all these mentioned in marriage seek wedlock not debauchery
as for those of you you have enjoyed their wives as a settlement
and there is no fault in you after the obligation is to you in the settlement and allah is allknowing allwise
and whoever does not marry the believing women to marry free believing women muhsanat such as are free from believing women muhsanat
allah knows best your faith
all of you are heedless
marry them both secretly and female and give them their mahr bridal money given to them in the husband s cause ’ and to marry them their mahr bridal money to marry them in wedlock and in wedlock
then if they return to the women of their punishment then let them be liable free women who are liable to half the penalty
and if they repent to you then they will be left behind
that is for those who fear to keep fornication
but if you are patient god is forgiving and merciful
allah wishes to make clear to you and guide you to the ways of those before you and to turn clemently
allah is allknowing allwise
allah wishes to turn to you but those who follow their lusts desire that you may turn away from the right way
allah wishes to lighten your burden for man was created weak
o you who believe do not consume your wealth among yourselves except by mutual agreement and do not kill yourselves
indeed allah is to you most merciful
and whosoever does that in transgression and wrongfully we shall roast him in the fire
and that is easy for allah
if you avoid the major sins we will remit from you your misdeeds and admit you into a noble gate
do not covet what allah has preferred some of you above others
for men is a share of what they have earned and ask forgiveness of what they have earned and ask allah of his bounty
allah has knowledge of all things
and we have appointed heirs to what is left behind
and those with whom you have made a covenant give them their share
allah is witness over everything
men are the managers of women because allah has made some of them excel others in their wealth and children
righteous women are obedient guarding in secret
as for those who fear their wives and strike them in fear of them their beds and beat them
but if they obey you seek no way against them
indeed allah is ever high exalted
if you fear a breach between the two appoint a breach between the two appoint from his wife an arbiter from her relatives and an arbiter from her relatives
if they wish to reconcile allah is allknowing allwise
worship allah and ascribe no partner to him
be kind to parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy and to the neighbour who is near to orphans and the neighbor and to the neighbor and to the neighbor and to the neighbor and to the neighbor of your relatives and to the destitute traveler
allah does not love the arrogant and the boastful
those who are miserly and enjoin miserliness upon others and hide what allah has bestowed upon them of his bounty
we have prepared for the faithless a humiliating punishment
and those who spend their wealth to show off their way to be seen of men and believe not in god and the last day and how evil is he who has made an evil companion
what would they believe in allah and the last day and spent out of what allah has provided them
allah is knowledgeable of them
indeed allah does not wrong anyone even the least injustice
if a good person he will give him double it and will bestow it from his presence a mighty reward
how then shall it be when we bring a witness from every nation and we bring you as a witness against these
on that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that the earth were levelled with them and they will not conceal anything from allah
o you who believe do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying except when you are washed yourselves and when you are travelling in a state of janabah
if you are ill or on a journey or you have slept or a way of nature or you have touched women and find no water then betake yourselves to clean earth and wipe your faces and hands with clean earth and wipe your hands
allah is pardoning and forgiving
have you not seen those who were given a portion of the book purchasing error and wish that they lose the right way
but allah knows best your enemies
allah is sufficient as a guardian and allah is sufficient as a helper
among the jews are those who distort words from their meanings and say we hear and we disobey and hear and ra ina
and if they had said we hear and obey and obey and look at us it would have been better for them and more upright
but allah has cursed them for their faithlessness
scarcely do they believe
believe in what we have revealed confirming what you have revealed before we obliterate faces and turn them backwards or curse them like the sabbathbreakers of allah s command ’ and the curse of allah is upon the last day
allah does not forgive that anyone should be ascribed to him but he forgives anything besides that
and he who ascribes partners to allah has indeed invented a tremendous sin
have you not seen those who claim purity for themselves
nay allah purifieth whom he wills and they will not be wronged a whit
see how they fabricate lies against allah
that is a manifest sin
have you not seen those who were given a share of the book and the unbelievers say to the idols of the unbelievers they are better guided than the believers
these are the ones whom allah has cursed
whomever god curses you will find no savior for him
or have they a share in the kingdom so that they would not have a single sesame
or do they envy people for what allah has given them of his bounty
we gave the family of abraham the book and wisdom and we gave them a mighty kingdom
and of them were some who believed in him and some of them were averse to it
hell is sufficient for the disbelievers
verily those who disbelieve our revelations presently we shall roast them in a fire
as often as their skins are cooked we exchange for them the skins of their skins so that they may taste the punishment
allah is mighty wise
and those who believe and do good deeds we shall admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally
for them are purified and we will admit them to deepening shade
allah commands you to deliver trusts to their owners and that you judge between people when you judge with justice
excellent is the admonition allah gives you
allah is hearer knower
o you who believe obey allah and obey the messenger and those of you who are in authority
and if you dispute concerning anything refer it to allah and the messenger if you believe in allah and the last day
that is better and excellent determination
have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and what was revealed to the unbelievers they desire to reject the devil although they were commanded to mislead them satan only to lead them astray
when it is said to them come to what allah has revealed and to the messenger you see the hypocrites turning away from you
how will it be when a misfortune smote them because of what their hands have sent before them
then they come to you swearing by allah saying we desire only kindness and conciliation between you
they are the ones whose hearts allah knows what is in their hearts
so leave them alone and speak to them clearly
we did not send any messenger except that he should be obeyed by allah s leave
and if they had wronged when they came to you they would have found allah and his messenger and the messenger had begged forgiveness for them and had allah willed they would have found allah the relenting the merciful
but by your lord they will not believe until they make you judge in their disputes and find in full submission to what is acceptable between you and be not certain
and had we prescribed for them slay yourselves or leave your homes they would not have done it except a few of them
and if they had done that they were instructed it would have been better for them and more strengthening
and then we would have given them from us a mighty wage
and we would have guided them to a straight path
whoever obeys god and the messenger — these are with the sincere and the sincere ones are with whom allah has blessed and good among the prophets
excellent are the companions of paradise
that is the grace of allah and sufficient is allah as knower
o believers take your precautions and advance in companies together or go forth all together
and among you is he who lingers behind then if disaster strikes you he says “ i am not with them ”
and if there betideth you a bounty from allah he saith as if there had never been a affection between you and him oh would that i had been with them i would have achieved a mighty achievement
let those who sell the life of this world for the hereafter fight in the way of allah
and whosoever fighteth in the way of allah whether he is slain or is slain or is slain or is he victorious
why should you fight in the way of allah and the helpless men and women who said our lord bring us out of this city and appoint for us a helper from yourself and appoint for us a helper
those who believe fight in the way of allah and those who disbelieve fight in the way of taghut satan
so fight against those on whose hearts are hardened
indeed the plot of satan is weak
have you not seen those who were told restrain your hands and establish prayer and pay zakah
but when fighting was ordained for them a section of them feared fear allah or a section of them feared his tongue said our lord why is it not for us that he should have stayed up for us
if only you could postpone it for us a little while ”
say the enjoyments of this world is better for the godfearing
and you shall not be wronged a date stone of date stone
wheresoever ye may be death will overtake you even though ye be in fortresses built up
if a good thing befalleth them they say this is from allah and if an evil thing befalls them they say this is from you
say all is from allah
what is amiss with these people that they understand not
whatever good reaches you it is from allah and whatever evil befalls you it is from yourself
we have sent you o muhammad saw as a messenger to mankind
allah is sufficient as a witness
he who obeys the messenger has certainly obeyed allah
but whosoever turns away we have not sent you as a watcher over them
they say obedience but when they leave you a party of them discuss in planning other than what you say
allah writes down what they hide
so turn away from them and put your trust in allah and sufficient is allah as a wakil disposer of affairs
do they not ponder about the qur an
had it been from other than allah they would have found therein much contradiction
and when there comes to them a public security or fear they broadcast it
but if they had referred it to the messenger and those who are with the messenger would have known it
and had it not been for the grace of allah upon you and his mercy you would have followed satan except a few
so fight in the way of allah
and rouse the believers to battle but urge the believers to fight you
peradventure allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve
allah is stronger in might and stronger in might
whosoever intercedes in a good cause shall receive a share of it and whosoever intercedes in a good cause shall receive a share of it
and allah is over everything a keeper
when you are greeted with a greeting greet with a better greeting than it or return it
allah is ever a careful account of all things
allah there is no god but he
he will gather you together on the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt
and who is truer in statement than allah
what is the matter with you that you are two groups regarding the hypocrites when allah has overwhelmed them for what they used to earn
do you want to guide those whom allah has led astray
and whomever allah leaves astray you will not find for him a way
they wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would become equal
so do not take from them allies until they emigrate in the way of allah
but if they turn away seize them and kill them wherever you find them
do not make friends or allies of them
except those who join a people between whom there is a treaty or those who come to you with their hearts or their breasts strained at you or fighting their own people
had allah willed he would have given them power over you and they would have fought you
if they withdraw from you and withdraw from you and offer you peace then allah does not permit you against them any way
you will find others who wish to be secure from you and secure from their own people and they wish to be secure from their own people and if they withdraw from you they will not cause you to go back any part of it and kill you and
it is not for a believer to slay a believer unless it be a believer except for a mischance which is a believer who does not give bloodmoney to the deceased s family unless they remit it
if he belonged to a people who are hostile to you is a believer then a believer is set free to free a believing slave
and if he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty then a treaty then bloodwit to be freed of the family of the deceased and the freeing of a believing slave
but he who does not find a penance from allah should fast for two consecutive months
allah is allknowing allwise
and whosoever slayeth a believer intentionally his recompense is hell and he who will remain in it forever
allah will curse him and prepare for him a great punishment
o you who believe when you go about fighting in the way of allah
and do not say to you a greeting you are not a believer seeking the greeting
with allah are plenteous gains
you were like this so now but allah has been gracious to you
therefore go back to discriminate
allah is aware of what you do
the believers are not equal to those who sit at home unless they are disabled and those who struggle in the way of allah with their wealth and their lives
allah has preferred those who fight in their wealth and their lives over the higher times over those who sit in rank with their wealth
allah has promised the best reward for those who struggle in the way of allah and those who sit at home but allah has preferred those who sit over the sedentary
degrees of rank from him and forgiveness and mercy
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
while those who do wrong when the angels seize themselves they are wronging themselves they will say what circumstances used to be you
they will say we were oppressed in the land
the angels will say was not allah s earth wide enough for you to emigrate therein
these their refuge shall be hell and worst indeed is that place to rest
except the weak ones among men women and children who can not devise a plan nor can they find a way
maybe allah will pardon them and allah is allforgiving allmerciful
and whosoever migrateth in the way of allah he shall find for him ample refuges and plenty of his abode and whosoever goes away his home in the earth and death overtaketh him his reward and died and death and his death
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and when you travel in the land there is no fault in you if you fear that you shorten the prayer especially give the unbelievers s cause ’ upon you the disbelievers may attack you
indeed the faithless are to you manifest enemy
and when you are among them who when you stand up for prayer and let a group of them stand up for you and let them stand up with you and let their weapons take their weapons
and when they have prostrated themselves then let them withdraw from their rear and let a group of them have not prayed come to you taking precaution and bearing their arms
those who disbelieve wish that you should neglect your weapons and your baggage so they would wheel on you a single assault
but there is no fault in you if you are sick or troubled by rain or you are sick but take your precautions
indeed allah has prepared for the faithless a humiliating punishment
when you have completed the prayer remember allah standing sitting and lying down on your sides and when you feel secure perform assalat iqamatassalat and offer the prayer
prayer is enjoined upon the believers at stated times
and do not slacken in pursuit of the enemy
if you are suffering they are suffering but you expect from god that which they expect not
allah is allknowing allwise
we have revealed to you the book with the truth that you may judge between people by what god has shown you
so do not be an advocate for the traitors
and ask forgiveness of allah
allah is forgiving merciful
and do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves indeed allah does not like the treacherous
they hide their character from men but they can not hide from allah with his knowledge and he is with them when they discuss
allah encompasses all that they do
you are arguing on their behalf in this life but who will argue on their behalf on the day of resurrection or who will be their pleader
and whosoever worketh a sin and then repenteth and sufficieth allah unto forgiveness of allah and afterward he will find allah forgiving merciful
and whosoever earns a sin earns it against himself
allah is allknowing allwise
and whosoever earns a fault or a sin and then casts it upon a sin and a flagrant sin
and if it was not for allah s grace ’ upon you and his mercy a faction of them would have resolved to mislead you but they only mislead themselves
but they know well that allah has sent down to you and they can not harm you in any way
allah has revealed to you the book and wisdom and has taught you what you did not know
and ever is allah s grace ’ upon you
there is no good in much of their secret talks except him who enjoins charity or reconciliation between people and those who do good deeds and those who do good deeds will be held in the cause of allah s pleasure ’
and whosoever opposes the messenger after the guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers we shall make him enter into error and he shall roast him in hell
what an evil destination
allah does not forgive that partners should be ascribed to him but he forgives anything for whom he wills
and he who associates others with allah has gone far astray
they invoke instead of him they invoke nothing but females and they invoke nothing but a froward devil
whom allah has cursed and he said i will take to your servants a portion of your servants
and i will mislead them and i will arouse them in the ears of the cattle and i will order them to slit the ears of cattle and i will command them to alter allah s creation ’
and whosoever takes satan as a wali protector or helper instead of allah has indeed suffered a manifest loss
he promises them and fills them with fancies but satan promises them nothing but delusions
these their resort is hell and they will find no saviors
but those who believe and do good deeds we will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow
the promise of allah is true and whose word is truer than allah
it is not your fancies nor the fancies of the people of the book
whoever does evil will do so for it and will not find for himself any protector or helper
and whoever does righteous deeds whether male or female while he is a believer he will enter paradise and they will not be wronged
and who is better in religion than he who submits his face to allah and he is a doer of good
and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and allah comprehends all things
they ask you for a ruling concerning women
say allah gives you the book concerning orphaned women and those who are with whom you have given knowledge and do not marry them in the mind that which is ordained for you and that you may marry the oppressed among the orphans the orphan girls
and whatever good you do allah knows it
if a woman fears either of her husband or desertion it is no sin upon them if they reconcile it with sin
and the greed of the affairs are in greed
and if you do good and fear allah then indeed allah is ever aware of what you do
you will not be able to do so much as you desire to do so
so do not incline towards one exclusively and leave her as if you leave the other suspended
if you do right and fear god god is forgiving and kind
but if they separate allah will enrich each of them out of his plenty
allah is ever allembracing allwise
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
we charged those who were given the book before you and you fear allah
if you disbelieve to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and allah is rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
allah is sufficient as a disposer of affairs
if he wills he can remove you o people and bring others in your place
whosoever desires the reward of this world with allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter
and allah is allhearer allseer
o you who believe be persistently standing firm in justice for allah even though it be against yourselves or your parents or your relatives
whether any man be rich or poor allah is rich or poor allah is nigher to all things
so do not follow your own desires lest you swerve
if you twist or turn away then know that allah is well aware of what you do
o you who believe believe in allah and his messenger and the book he has sent down to his messenger and the book he has sent down before
whoever disbelieves in allah and his angels his books and his messengers and the last day has strayed far away
those who believe then disbelieve then disbelieve then disbelieve and then disbelieve then increase in infidelity and then disbelieve allah will never forgive them nor guide them to the path
give tidings to the hypocrites that there is a painful punishment for them
those who take disbelievers for friends instead of believers do they seek honour from them
so that all honour belongs to allah
he has sent down to you in the book that when you hear god s revelations ’ or derided do not sit with them until they engage in some other talk or ridiculed
you would then be like them
indeed allah will gather hypocrites and disbelievers all together in hell
many a people who wait about you
if there comes to you a victory from allah they say were we not with you but if the faithless say ‘ were we not with you we not prevail over you
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection
allah does not bestow the disbelievers on the believers any way
the hypocrites seek to deceive allah but it is he who beguileth them
when they stand up for prayer they stand lazily showing off to the people and not remembering allah except a little
wavering between these and the believers and those whom you have neither to be foremost in faith
and he whom allah lets go astray you will not find a way for him
o believers take not the unbelievers as friends instead of believers
do you want to give god a clear proof against you
the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire you will find no helper for them
except those who repent and mend their ways and hold fast to allah and make their religion sincerely for allah and those who are with the believers
why should allah punish you if you acknowledge the truth and believe in allah and allah is ever responsive allknowing
allah does not like the public uttering who has been wronged
allah is hearer knower
if you do good openly or pardon a good deed we will pardon them for god is allpardoning allpowerful
and those who disbelieve in allah and his messengers and seek to make allah s revelations ’ and his messengers
and we have already told “ believe in some sayings ” and say “ we are muslims ” and “ some of them are muslims ”
these are the unbelievers and we have prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement
but those who believe in allah and his messengers and make no distinction between any of them we shall give them their rewards
allah is forgiving merciful
the people of the book ask you to bring down a book from heaven
they asked moses for something even greater than that they said show us allah plainly
so the thunderbolt seized them for their wickedness
then they took to themselves after the clear signs had come to them and we pardoned that and we gave moses the clear signs
and we raised the mount above them the mount and we said to them enter the gate prostrating and we said to them transgress not the sabbath
and we took from them a solemn covenant
so they disbelieved in the words of allah and their covenant and their killing of the prophets unjustly and their killing of the prophets unjustly and their saying our hearts are uncircumcised
so believe not except a little
and for their faithlessness and their uttering against mary a monstrous calumny
and for their saying we killed the messiah jesus son of mary the messenger of allah but they killed him not and they killed him and they killed him not crucified him nor crucified him nor crucified him nor crucified him
they have no more than a little
indeed those who differ about it are in doubt about it
they have no authority over their words
they do not follow their footsteps
nay allah raised him up to himself
allah is mighty wise
there is none of the people of the book but will believe in him before his death and on the day of resurrection he will be a witness against them
for the wrongdoing of the jews we forbade them many things which had been made lawful to them and for their barring many of the way of allah
and their taking of riba usury while they were forbidden from taking unlawfully of their devouring of the wealth and consuming for the people of the wealth of the people
and we have prepared for the faithless among them a painful punishment
but those of them who are wellgrounded in knowledge and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you and the establishers of prayer and the givers of prayer and the last day
we will give them a great reward
we revealed to you as we revealed to noah and the prophets after him and we revealed to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and jacob and jesus and jonah and aaron and jonah aaron and aaron and solomon and job jonah
and we gave david the psalms
and messengers we have already told you of messengers before and messengers we have already told you of stories
and allah spoke to moses with his words
and we sent messengers to give glad tidings of glad tidings and warning so that mankind may have no argument against allah after the messengers
allah is mighty wise
but allah bears witness to that which he has sent down to you and that the angels bear witness over it and allah is sufficient as witness
those who disbelieve and bar from the way of allah have gone far astray
indeed those who disbelieve and commit wrong allah will not forgive them nor guide them to a way
except the road of hell they will abide therein forever
and that is easy for allah
o mankind
do not exaggerate in your religion and do not say about allah except the truth
the messiah son of mary was only a messenger of allah and his word that he conveyed to mary and a spirit from him
so believe in allah and his messengers
and do not say three desist it is better for you
refrain it is better for you
allah is only one god
glory be to him that he should have a son
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs a trustee
the messiah will never disdain to be a servant of allah nor will the angels who are near to him
and whosoever disdaineth serving him and stiffnecked and verily he will gather them all together
as for those who believe and do good deeds he will give them their wages in full and increase them in full
but as for those who disdain and were proud he will punish them with a painful punishment
they will find none to help them or save allah
o mankind there has come to you a conclusive proof from your lord and we have sent down to you a clear light
so those who believe in allah and hold fast to him he will admit them into his mercy and grace and will guide them to a straight path
they ask you for a verdict
say allah pronounces to you a ruling concerning him who dies childless and has not taken a son for you if he leaves anything for her a wife she has no children
and he inherits from her if she dies and leaves behind him
if there are two sisters then they shall have twothirds of what he leaves
if there are siblings and sisters then there shall be two sisters the male and female
allah makes clear to you lest you go astray
allah is knower indulgent
o you who believe
and eat of the meat of the forbidden to you except when you are in game while you are in pilgrim sanctity
indeed allah decrees whatever he wills
o you who believe do not violate the rites of allah nor the sacred month nor the offerings nor the garlanded and the garlanded people for the sacred house seeking the bounty of their lord and pleasure
but when you have made lawful for them you are free from pilgrim sanctity
and do not let your hatred of a people who barred you from the holy mosque move you from the sacred mosque for aggression
cooperate in righteousness and godwariness and godwariness and do not cooperate in sin
and fear allah verily allah is severe in chastising
forbidden to you are carrion blood and blood and the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah and the strangled are killed by strangling or by strangling or by a wild animal or by goring or by the goring of horns and the
today those who disbelieve have despaired of your religion
so do not fear them but fear me
today i have perfected your religion for you and have completed my favor upon you and have approved for you islam as your religion
but whosoever is driven by hunger not inclining toward him nor is he of the blame
allah is forgiving merciful
they ask you o muhammad what is lawful for them
say “ all good things are lawful to you ”
and all that you have taught hunting dogs to catch for you
eat of what they catch for you pronouncing upon it and pronounce the name of allah for you
and fear allah
allah is swift in reckoning
this day the good things are made lawful to you
the food of the people of the book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them
and chaste women of the scripture before you and chaste women who were given the book before you and chaste women and chaste women who were given their chastity in marriage wedlock not in marriage nor taking them secret lovers
and whosoever disbelieves in the faith his work will go astray and he will be among the losers in the hereafter
o you who believe when you stand up for prayer wash your faces and your feet up to elbows and wipe your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles
and keep your duty to allah and keep your duty to him
if you are sick or traveling or if you are travelling then purify yourself and wipe your faces and your hands and wipe out to the earth and wipe your faces and your hands with it and wipe your faces and hands and your feet
allah does not want to burden you but he intends to purify you and to complete his favor upon you so that you may be grateful
remember allah s favour upon you and his covenant which he bound you when you said we hear and we obey
allah is knower of that which is in the breasts
o you who believe fulfil god s commands ’ and do not be witnesses for god loves the equitable
let not your hatred to deviate you from justice
and be wary of allah
allah is aware of what you do
allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward
and those who disbelieve and deny our revelations these are the fellows of the flaming fire
o believers remember god s favour upon you when a people purposed to stretch out their hands against you and he restrained their hands from you
and fear allah
in allah let the believers put their trust
allah made a covenant of old with the children of israel and we raised among them twelve leaders
and allah said “ i am with you and establish prayer and give zakah and believe in my messengers and lend to allah a good loan i will remit from you gardens beneath which rivers flow and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and admit you to
but whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
then because of their breaking their breaking of their breaking the covenant they broke their covenant from their meanings and they were reminded of a people given to a good word
you will always see deceit among them except a few of them
but forgive them and overlook their misdeeds
indeed allah loves the doers of good
and from those who say we are christians we took their covenant but they forgot a part of that which they were reminded
so we provoked enmity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection when allah will inform them of what they used to craft
o people of the scripture our messenger has come to you expounding to you much of what you have given you and he passes much as a secret of booty
a light from allah has come to you and a clear book
by allah s ’ guides whoever obeys the ways of peace and brings them out from darkness into light by his permission and guides them to the straight path
they are unbelievers who say god is the messiah son of mary
say who could prevent the messiah son of mary if allah had willed to destroy christ the son of mary and his mother and everyone on earth
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
he creates whatever he wills and allah is able to do all things
the jews and the christians say we are sons of allah and his beloved ones
say why then does he punish you for your sins
nay you are mortals of his creating a human being like him
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and toward him is the destination
o people of the book there has come to you our messenger muhammad saw making clear to you our messenger muhammad saw after the truth has come to us a bearer of glad tidings and a warner before the messengers of the messengers of the hellfire
so now there has come to you a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
allah is able to do all things
and remember when moses said to his people o my people remember allah s favour upon you when he appointed prophets among you prophets and made you kings and gave you what he had not given to any one of the worlds
o my people enter the holy land which allah has ordained for you and do not turn back in retreat and do not turn back to your backs
they said o moses there are a tyrannical nation in it
they will not enter it until they leave it
then if they leave it we will enter
two men of those who feared allah said enter the gate on whom allah has bestowed a gate against them and if you enter the gate you will be victorious
and put your trust in allah if you are believers
they said o musa moses we will never enter it as long as they are in it
go you and your lord and fight you and fight we will sit here with sitting right here
he said my lord i have none but myself and my brother so distinguish between us and the wicked people
he said “ this is forbidden to moosa wherever they may wander in the land
so do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people
relate to them the tale of adam s two sons ’
when they offered a sacrifice to the one of them and said ‘ i will not be accepted from you ’
the former said allah accepts only from the godfearing
if you extend your hand to kill me i will not extend my hand to kill you
i fear allah the lord of the worlds
i desire that you should be laden with my sin and your sin and become one of the inmates of the fire that is the recompense of the wrongdoers
then his soul permitted to him for his brother so he slew him and became one of the losers
then allah sent a raven scratching up the earth to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother
he said woe alas for me
this is so that i may bury my brother and be a <unk>
then he became regretful
that is why we decreed for the children of israel that whosoever kills a soul in the earth for a soul unless it be a dying person
and whoever saves a person s soul it is as if he had killed all mankind
and our messengers came to them with clear proofs but many of them continued to commit excesses in the land
the recompense of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive in the land for those who cause corruption in the land is that they shall be slain or crucified or their hands and feet cut off from opposite sides or be exiled from the land
that is a disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter is a great punishment
except for those who repent before you apprehend them
know that allah is forgiving merciful
o you who believe
be wary of allah and seek the means of recourse to him and strive in his way so that you may succeed
and if they had all that is in the earth and the like of it they would not offer it as ransom
a painful punishment awaits them
they will wish to come out of the fire but they will not come out from it
for them is a lasting punishment
as for the thief male or female cut off the hands of the thief male or female cut off their hands as a recompense for what they have done
allah is mighty wise
but whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms allah will accept his repentance indeed allah is allforgiving allmerciful
do you not know that to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he forgives whom he wills
allah is able to do all things
o messenger let not those who hurry to disbelief grieve you are not satisfied with their mouths but those who say we believe and their hearts are avid listeners to you and from among those who come to you who are judaised listeners to their tongues and their hearts
they distort words from their meanings saying if you are given this accept it then if you are not given it beware
and whomever allah wishes to mislead you can not avail him anything against allah
they are the ones whose hearts allah does not want to purify
for them is disgrace in this world and for them is a mighty punishment in the hereafter
they are listeners to falsehood devourers of the forbidden
so if they come to you judge between them or turn away from them
and if you turn away from them they will not harm you at all
and if you judge judge between them with justice
indeed allah loves the just
but why should they make you judge for judgement while they have the torah in which is the judgement of allah and they turn away from it
we sent down the torah in which is guidance and light
and the prophets who had submitted judged by allah and were entrusted with him in islam and the scholars and jurists
they have instructed the torah and the gospel for a number of the scriptures and the people of the book
so do not fear people but fear me and sell my verses for a little price
my revelations are wo nt to do so
those who do not judge by what allah has revealed are the unbelievers
and we ordained for them therein an eye for life and an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye and an ear for an ear and an ear for an eye for an eye against him and for wounds
but whosoever forgoes it for him the freewill offerings
those who do not judge by what allah has revealed are the wrongdoers
and we sent following in their footsteps jesus son of mary confirming the torah which was revealed before him
and we gave him guidance and light and light that he may be guided to the godfearing and the godfearing
let the people of the gospel judge by what allah has revealed in it
and whosoever does not judge by what allah has revealed — it is they who are the transgressors
we have sent down to you the book with the truth confirming what was revealed before it and assuring it
so judge between them by what allah has revealed and do not follow their desires from the truth that has come to you
for each we have appointed a law and a way of life
had allah wished he could have made you one community but he tests you in what he has given you
so compete in goodness
to allah is your return and he will inform you of what you used to differ
judge between them with fairness
and do not make them hear the least
beware of what allah has revealed to you o muhammad saw from them lest they should beware of you
and if they turn away know that allah intends to afflict them for some of their sins
and indeed many of mankind are transgressors
do they seek the judgement of paganism
who is better than allah in judgement for a people who have faith
o you who believe take not the jews and the christians for friends
and whosoever of you allies of them he is one of them
allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
so you see those in whose hearts is a disease of hypocrisy said to them “ we fear lest a misfortune should befall us ”
but perhaps allah will bring about victory or some event from him and then they will be regretful in their hearts
and those who believe will say are these the ones who swore by allah that they were with you
their works have failed and they are the losers
and whoever of you turns his religion and dies from his religion then he will bring a people who love him humble towards the believers and who love him humble towards the disbelievers and who love him humble towards the disbelievers and who love him and who love the
that is the grace of allah which he bestows on whom he wills
and allah is allsufficient for his creatures needs allknower
your friend is only allah and his messenger and those who believe and those who establish worship and pay the poordue and bow down
and whosoever takes god and his messenger and those who believe and the believers surely the party of god is the victor
o believers take not as your friends in the way of those who were given the book before you and those who have made a sport and a pastime
fear allah if you are believers
and when you call for prayer they take it for a mockery and fun of them do not take a mockery
say o people of the scripture do you resent us except what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before we were most of you are transgressors
say shall i tell you of a worse position than that
and those whom allah has cursed and has wreaked angry and fake deities and subdued and they are worse in apes and the devil and the devil of those who worshipped them are worse in error and further astray from the right way
when they come to you they say we believe
but they have departed with disbelief and they go into with it
allah knows best what they hide
you see many of them race towards sin and aggression and devour the forbidden
evil is what they used to do
why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid them from speaking sinfully and from consuming illicit earnings
evil is what they used to do
the jews say allah s hand is tied
chained are their hands and damned for what they say
nay but his hands are outspread he expends
which is revealed to you from your lord that he may increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief
we have cast among them enmity and hatred till the day of resurrection
every time they ignite the flames of war allah extinguished it
they strive to spread corruption on the earth and allah does not like the agents of corruption
and if the people of the book had believed and feared allah we would have warded off evil and admitted them into gardens of delight
and had they observed the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and what has been revealed to them from their lord they would have consumed amply from above them and from beneath their feet
among them are some who are moderate but many of them are evil
o messenger muhammad saw convey the message which has been revealed to you from your lord
and if you do not then you would not have delivered his message
allah will protect you from mankind
indeed allah does not guide the faithless lot
say o people of the scripture you have not sent down the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and the injeel gospel and what has been revealed to you from your lord
that which has been revealed to you from your lord will increase many of them in transgression and disbelief
so do not grieve for the unbelieving nation
indeed those who believe and the jews and the sabians and the sabians and the christians whoever believes in allah and the last day and performs good deeds there shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
we took a covenant from the children of israel and we sent messengers to them
whenever a messenger came to them with what their souls desired not to bring a messenger to them they called some of them they slew and some they slew
they thought there would be no trial so they turned blind and deaf
then allah turned towards them in forgiveness then again many of them turned blind and deaf
then allah is allseer of what they do
they are indeed faithless who say ‘ allah is the messiah son of mary ’ whereas the messiah was messiah the son of mary ’
worship allah my lord and your lord
indeed allah has forbidden him who has made a share of the fire and his refuge is hell
the wrongdoers have no saviors ”
they are unbelievers who say god is the third of three
but there is no god but he
if they do not desist from what they say a painful punishment will afflict those of them who disbelieve
will they not repent to allah and ask his forgiveness
allah is forgiving merciful
the messiah son of mary was not but a messenger before him and many an apostle had passed away before him
his mother was a saintly woman
see how we make plain to them the signs so look how they are deluded away
say “ do you worship besides allah what has no power to harm you or benefit you ”
allah is hearer knower
say o people of the scripture jews and christians
and do not follow the opinions of those who went astray before the truth and do not follow the vain desires of the people who went astray and strayed away from the right way
cursed were those who disbelieved among the children of israel and cursed them because of their transgression and because they rebelled
they did not forbid one another from the wrongs they used to do
evil was what they used to do
you see many of them taking the unbelievers for their allies
evil is what they have sent ahead for them and what they have forwarded for them is the punishment of allah
had they believed in allah and the messenger and what is revealed to him they would not have taken them as allies
but many of them are transgressors
you will find the most vehement of mankind in enmity to the believers and you will find the nearest of those who believe in the way of those who say we are christians and you will find the nearest of them affection
that is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant
and when they hear what has been revealed to the messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth which they have recognised
they say our lord
they say our lord we believe so write us down among the witnesses
why should we not believe in allah and the truth which has come to us and that our lord should admit us to the righteous
so allah rewarded them for what they said ‘ this is for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally
that is the reward of the doers of good
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations these are the fellows of the flaming fire
o you who believe forbid not the good things which allah has made lawful for you and do not transgress
allah does not love the transgressors
eat of the lawful and good things which allah has provided you
and fear allah in whom you believe
allah does not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths but he will impose blame upon you for breaking what you demand
the expiation thereof is the feeding of ten needy persons with the average thereof and the clothing of the freeing of a slave and the clothing of a slave
he who can not afford the fast for three days
that is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn
thus allah makes clear his revelations to you that you may be grateful
o you who believe wine and gambling idols and divining arrows are abominations from satan s handiwork
avoid them so that you may prosper
satan only desires to create enmity and hatred between you through wine and gambling and to bar you from the remembrance of allah and from prayer
will you then desist
obey allah and obey the messenger and beware
if you turn away know that the duty of our messenger is only to deliver the message clearly
those who believe and do good deeds shall be made lawful for them in the state of righteousness and thereafter they shall be godfearing and believe and do good works and believe and fear allah and believe and do good works and fear and believe and fear him and
allah loves the doers of good
o believers allah will test you with something of the game which your hands possess and spears in order that allah may test you with something of the unseen
then whoever transgresses after that for him there is a painful punishment
o believers do not kill game while you are in pilgrim sanctity for the offering the offering of the one who kills it intentionally the same for the other s offering is eatable of you and whoever kills it intentionally the penalty of his action is an expiation for
permitted to you is the game of the sea and the food of the sea and for you is permitted to hunt and for you
but forbidden for you is the game of the land whilst you are on pilgrimage
and fear allah unto whom ye will be gathered
allah has appointed the ka bah the sacred house a sanctuary for mankind and the sacred month and the garlands and the garlands and the garlands and the garlands that you may know that allah is allknowing allaware
know that allah is severe in retribution and that allah is forgiving merciful
the messenger s duty ’ is only to convey the message
allah knows all that you reveal and all that you hide
say the bad and the good are not equal even though the abundance of the bad attract you
so fear allah o you who possess intellect and avoid all kinds of sins so that you may be successful
o you who believe
if they had been in the qur an they would have read it and they would have been told
so that allah has pardoned them
allah is ever forgiving and forbearing
a people before you asked about them and then disbelieved in it
allah has not appointed any animal over you nor has he appointed a shecamel dedicated to allah except for the faithless
those who disbelieve invent lies about allah and most of them do not understand
when it is said to them come to what god has sent down and to the messenger they reply sufficient for us is that we found our fathers following even though their fathers knew not
o you who have believed do not stray on your own behalf he who has strayed from his own selves and whoever goes astray then you will not be responsible for you and allah will inform you of what you used to do
o believers when death approaches any of you at the bequeathing is to come to you at the bequeathing testimony for you if you are journeying in the land and the affliction of death approaches you and the affliction of death befalls you
detain them after the prayer and if you doubt they will swear by allah affirming his wife we will not sell it for a price even though it is a relative price and we will not exchange it for a price
we will then be of the sinful
and if it is discovered that the two of them the two others are in their place of perjury they will be more likely to take up for testimony than their own testimony and they say “ god is more powerful for our own group
and if they do not swear by allah we shall indeed be among the wrongdoers
that is more likely that they will bear testimony or else they will fear that their oaths may be disproved by oaths after their oaths
so fear allah and listen
allah does not guide the transgressing lot
on the day when allah will gather the messengers and say what response were you given
they will say we have no knowledge
you are the knower of things hidden
and remember the day when he will say to his son o jesus son of mary
when he wished to make you in the cradle and to maturity
and when you had sought the book and the qur an ’ in the sea and you breathed into it from clay a bird by my leave and it is a bird
you healed the blind and the leprous and you healed the dead by my leave and i revive the dead by my leave
and when you came to the children of israel with clear proofs i restrained you from them but they said “ this is nothing but obvious witchcraft ”
and when i inspired the disciples saying believe in me and my messenger
they said we believe in you and bear witness that we are muslims
and when the disciples said o jesus son of mary is your lord able to send down upon us a table from heaven with food and fear allah if you are believers
they said we desire to eat thereof and to eat thereof and we know that thou hast told us our fathers the truth and that we may be witnesses to it
jesus son of mary said “ our lord send down upon us a table from heaven for us is a festival for us and for the first of us and the last of us and the last day ”
give us sustenance for you are the best of providers
allah said “ i will send it down to you but whoever of you disbelieves then i will punish him with a punishment of which i will not punish anyone with the punishment of any other ”
and remember when allah will say o jesus son of mary did you say to mankind and your mother and my mother and your mother
he will say “ glory be to you
it was not for me to say what i have no right to say
you know what is in my self and i do not know what is in you
you are the knower of the unseen
i said to them nothing except what you commanded me to say ‘ worship allah my lord and your lord ’
i was a witness over them while i dwelt witness over them
and when he had been gracious unto him thou art able to do all things
if you punish them they are your slaves they are your subjects and if you forgive them you are the almighty the wise
allah will say this is a day when the truthful will profit by their truthfulness
for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally
allah is with them and that is the mighty triumph
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them and he is able to do all things
all praise is due to allah who created the heavens and the earth and has created the darkness and light
and those who disbelieve ascribe rivals to their lord
it is he who created you from clay and then decreed a term for you is the appointed time of the time of allah
yet you doubt
he is allah in the heavens and the earth he knows all that you hide and your disclosures and he knows what you earn
and never does a sign of their lord come to them but they turn away from it
they denied the truth when it came to them so they will come to know what they used to ridicule
have they not seen how many a generation we destroyed before them
and we have not established you on earth as much more powerful than we have given you and made the highest part of them
so we destroyed them for their sins and raised from the sky for their sins and raised them up another generation
had we sent down to you a book we had sent down upon you a book they would have touched it with their hands and their hands would have said this is nothing but plain magic
they say why has no angel been sent down to him
and if we sent down an angel the matter would have been settled and they would not be reprieved
had we made him an angel we would have made him a man and we would have made him a man as a man and they are in doubt
and assuredly messengers before thee were mocked but those who mocked them were encompassed by that they mocked
say travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell those who belied
say to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
he has prescribed mercy for himself
he will gather you on the day of resurrection in which there is no doubt and those who have courted their ruin
and to him belongs whatever is in the night and whatever is on the day
he is the hearer the knower
say shall i take as a protector other than allah the originator of the heavens and the earth and he feedeth and is not fed
say i have been commanded to be the first of those who submit to him and do not be one of the idolaters
say “ if i disobey my lord i fear the punishment of a tremendous day ”
whosoever has spared that day allah has mercy on him that is the manifest triumph
if allah touch you with affliction none can remove it except he
and if he touches you with good then he is able to do all things
he is the omnipotent over his servants and he is the allwise the allaware
say what thing is greatest in testimony
say allah is witness between me and you
this quran has been revealed to me that i may warn you thereby and whomever it has been revealed to me
do you indeed testify that there are other gods besides allah
say “ i do not testify to him ” say “ he is the only one god and i am innocent of what you associate ”
those to whom we gave the book know it as they recognise their own sons but those who have courted their own souls they do not believe
and who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about allah or denies his ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
the wrongdoers will not prosper
and on the day when we will resurrect them all together then we will say to those who ascribed partners to allah where are your partners whom you professed
then their excuse will be to say by allah our lord we were not idolaters
look how they lie against themselves and how they forged will forsake them
and of them are some who listen to you but we have put it veils over their hearts lest they understand it and heaviness in their ears
even if they see every sign they will not believe in it
when they come to you arguing with you they say this is nothing but stories of the ancients
and they forbid others from him and avoid him they are themselves remote
they destroy none except themselves but they do not perceive it
if you could see when they are stationed before their lord they will say “ would that we were dead and we would not be among the believers ”
nay but what they used to hide before them
and if they were sent back they would revert to what they were forbidden they would surely be liars
they say there is nothing but our present life in this world and we shall not be raised
if you could see when they are stationed before their lord he will say ‘ is this not real
they will say yes by our lord
he will say then taste the punishment for what you used to deny
they are those who rejected the meeting with god
when the hour overtakes them suddenly they will say alas for us that we neglected it
evil is what they bear
the life of this world is nothing but a sport and a sport and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who are godfearing
will you not understand
we know that which they say saddens you
it is not you that they deny you
nay but the wrongdoers deny the signs of allah
and assuredly we sent apostles before thee but they were patient until they endured rejection and persecution until our help came unto them
there is no change the words of allah
indeed some messengers of the messengers has already reached you
if their turning away grieves you then if you can find a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the skies and bring them a sign to them
and had allah willed he could have gathered them together so do not be one of the ignorant
only those who hear will respond
as for the dead allah will resurrect them then to him they will be returned
they say why has no sign been sent down to him from his lord
say allah has power to send down a sign but most of them do not know
there is no animal on the earth nor a bird that flies with its wings but they are communities like you
we have neglected nothing in the book
then to their lord they will be gathered
those who deny our signs are deaf and dumb in darkness
allah leads astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills to a straight path
say “ do you think if the punishment of allah comes upon you or the hour overtakes you would you call upon other than allah if you are truthful ”
no you will call upon him and he will remove what you call upon him if he wills he could remove what you call upon
so worship allah with obedience before you and associate others with him
we have sent messengers before you and we seized them with stress and distress so that they might humble themselves
if only when our calamity came upon them they humbled themselves
but their hearts were hardened and satan made all that they had done seem fair to them
so when they forgot what they had been reminded of we opened to them the gates of all things until when they rejoiced in what they were given we seized them suddenly and they were sore confounded
so the people who committed wrong were cut off
praise be to allah the lord of the worlds
say o muhammad saw tell me if allah seizes your hearing and your sight and sets up rivals to allah who could restore them to you
see how we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc yet they turn away
say tell me if the punishment of allah comes upon you suddenly or openly or openly can any one be destroyed except the wrongdoing people
we send not the messengers except as bearers of glad tidings and warners
those who believe and do good deeds and fear no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve
but those who deny our signs will afflict them for their disobedience
say i do not say to you that i possess the treasuries of allah nor do i say to you that i possess the unseen nor do i say to you i am an angel
i only follow what is revealed to me
say are the blind and the seeing alike equal
will you not reflect
and warn with it those who fear that they will be gathered before their lord and have no protector or helper
they may haply take heed for themselves
and do not drive away those who call upon their lord morning and evening seeking his countenance
you are accountable for them no account of their deeds nor do they bring you any constraint upon them
if you drive them away you will be one of the wrongdoers
thus we have tried some of them by means of others that they may say are these the ones whom allah has favoured amongst us
does allah not know the thankful
and when those who believe in our signs come unto you say peace be upon you
your lord has prescribed mercy for himself and then repents after you that he may forgive you and then repents and mends his sins and reforms then allah is oft forgiving most merciful
thus do we explain our verses in detail so that the way of the criminals may be shown the way of the criminals
say “ i am forbidden to worship those you invoke besides allah ” say “ i have been forbidden to worship those you have been forbidden ”
if i should be gone astray and i would not be of the rightly guided
say i am on clear proof from my lord
but you deny it and i do not possess it
judgement belongs only to allah and he is the dominant over all things
he relates the truth and he is the best of deciders
say if i had that which you seek to hasten the matter would have been decided between me and you and allah is well aware of the wrongdoers
with him are the keys of the unseen none knows them except he
he knows what is in land and sea
not a leaf falls but he knows it
and no grain in the earth nor is there anything fresh or withered but that is recorded in a clear book
it is he who takes your souls by night and by day what you earn
then he raiseth you in that therein that you may be fulfilled
then to him is your return then he will inform you of what you used to do
he is the alldominant over his servants and he sends guards to watch over you
until when death comes to one of you he who guards up from you when death comes to one of you they do not neglect him
then they are returned to allah their maula lord maula lord maula true protector
unquestionably his is the judgement and he is the swiftest of reckoners
say who delivereth you from the darkness of the land and sea when you call upon him humbly and secretly and in whispers aloud if we deliver you from this we will be among the thankful
say allah delivereth you from it and from every disaster
yet you associate others with him
say he is able to send upon you a torment from above you or from beneath your feet or confound you with divisions in your midst and make you taste the violence of one another
see how variously we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc so that they may understand
your people have denied it though it is the truth
say i am not a guardian over you
for every happening is a finality and you will know
when you see those who plunge into our verses withdraw from them until they engage in some other talk
and if shaitan satan makes you forget sit not after the remembrance sit in the company of the wrongdoers
those who fear allah are not accountable for them but it is no fault in them so that they may be godfearing
leave alone those who take their religion as playing and play and the life of this world deceived
remind them hereby lest a soul should be requited for what it has earned
and for him there is none to be a protector beside allah and he will not be accepted from it
these are they who are given to drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for their disbelief
say shall we invoke besides allah that which can neither harm us nor benefit us and turn back after allah has guided us to the devils and then he will turn back on the earth after the guidance they will say to the right way to the call of
say verily the guidance of allah is the guidance and we are commanded to submit to the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
and that “ and perform the prayer and fear him and it is to him that you will be gathered ”
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in truth
and the day when he saith be it shall be
his word is the truth
his is the sovereignty on the day when the trumpet is blown
knower of the unseen and the seen
he is allwise allaware
and remember when abraham said to his father azar do you take idols for gods
i see you and your people in manifest error ’
thus did we show abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that he might be of those who believe
when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star he said this is my lord
but when it set he said i love not those that disappear
then when he beheld the moon uprise he said this is my lord
but when it set he said “ my lord guides me i will surely be among the people gone astray ”
then when he beheld the sun rising he said this is my lord this is the greatest
but when it set he said o my people i am quit of what you associate with allah
i have turned my face toward him who created the heavens and the earth uprightly and i am not one of the idolaters
his people argued with him and said do you argue with me concerning allah
i fear not any harm in him save what you associate with him
my lord does not avail me anything
my lord embraces all things in his knowledge will you not remember
how should i fear that you should worship when you fear ascribing partners to allah for which he has not sent down any authority
which of the two parties has more right to safety if you have any knowledge
those who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice it is they who have faith and they are the rightly guided
that was our argument which we gave abraham against his people
we raise in degrees whom we will
indeed your lord is allwise allknowing
and we gave him isaac and jacob
and we guided each one of them
and noah and his descendants before him and sulaiman and sulaiman and yusuf and job and joseph and moosa and haroon
thus do we reward the doers of good
and zachariah and john and jesus and elias each one of them was of the righteous
and ishmael and elijah and jonah and lot and jonah and lot we preferred them over all beings
and their fathers and their progeny and their brethren and their brethren and their brethren and we chose them and guided them to a straight path
this is the guidance of allah wherewith he guideth whomsoever he will of his bondmen
and had they associated others with allah in his divinity would have gone to waste
they are those to whom we gave the book and judgement and prophethood
and if these disbelieve in it we will bring a people who do not believe in it
they are those whom allah guided
say o muhammad saw o muhammad saw i ask of you no fee for it
it is just a reminder for all the nations ’
they did not appraise allah with his words when they said “ allah has sent down nothing ”
say who sent down the book which moses brought a light and guidance for people
you have taught the quran although you were taught the quran which you had taught them
and leave them alone playing
and this is a blessed book which we have sent down confirming what was revealed before it and that you may warn the mother of cities makka and those around it
those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and are watchful of their moral obligations
who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against allah or says it has been revealed to me when it has been revealed to him who says i have been revealed to any inspiration or he who says i will reveal the like of what allah has
if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the throes of death and the angels extend your hands saying yield up your souls today you are being repaid to allah with your unfaith and your tongues and your hands with a disgraceful punishment
you have come to us individually just as we created you the first time and left behind you all that we had bestowed upon you and you were heedless of what we had bestowed upon you
now are the ties betwixt you severed and strayed from you
indeed allah is the cleaver of the seedgrain and the date stone the living and brings the dead from the living
that is allah so how are you deluded away from him
he is the cleaver of the daybreak and he made the night a rest and the sun and the moon for reckoning
that is the ordaining of the allmighty the allknowing
it is he who has appointed for you the stars that you may be guided by them amid the darkness of land and sea
we have detailed the revelations for a people who know
it is he who created you from one soul
and there is a place of refuge for you and a place of rest
we have detailed the revelations for a people who understand
it is he who sends down water from the sky and thereby we bring forth the green leaf of the palmtree from it and we bring forth the grain of grapes and the olive and the pomegranate like thereof and unlike
look upon the fruit thereof when they bear fruit and ripen
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
yet they ascribe partners to allah what he created them and he has created them and they impute to him sons and daughters
glory be to him high be he exalted above what they describe
originator of the heavens and the earth how can he have a child when he has no spouse
he created all things and he has knowledge of everything
such is allah your lord
there is no god but he
he is the supreme creator the knower
so worship him and he is the wakil trustee disposer of affairs guardian etc
vision comprehendeth him not but he comprehendeth all vision
he is the subtle the aware
indeed insights have come to you from your lord
so whosoever blindeth himself will do so for his own good and whosoever blindeth himself against it
i am not a guardian over you
thus do we explain our verses so that they may say you may make this qur an ’ and that we may make clear the verses of knowledge
the faithless possessed of the signs of allah is more severe and more intense for them
follow what has been revealed to you from your lord there is no god except him and turn away from the idolaters
had allah willed they would not have associated others with allah
we have not appointed you as a guardian over them nor are you a manager over them
do not revile those they invoke other than allah lest they should revile allah out of ignorance
thus we have made their conduct seem decorous to all things
then to their lord is their return and he will inform them of what they used to do
they solemnly swear by allah with their solemn oaths that if a sign comes to them they will believe in it
say signs are only with god
and what will make you realize that it will not come to them if they were to believe
we turn away their hearts and their visions as they refused to believe in it and we leave them in their insolence wandering blindly
and even if we had sent down the angels to them and the dead spoke to them and assembled all things before them they would still believe unless allah willed they would not believe unless they were muslims
but most of them know not
thus we have appointed for every prophet an enemy satans and jinn
they were wo nt to talk to one another to talk
had your lord wished they would not have done it
so leave them alone with their fabrications
and that it may incline toward the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter and that they may be pleased with it and that they may be pleased with it
shall i seek a judge other than allah when it is he who has revealed to you the book explained in detail
those to whom we gave the book know that it is revealed by your lord
so be not thou of those who doubt
perfected is the word of your lord in truth and justice
none can change his words
he is the hearer the knower
and if you obey most of those on the earth they would mislead you from the path of allah they are only conjecturing
your lord knows best who strays from his path and he knows best those who are rightly guided
eat of that meat on which allah s name ’ has been mentioned if you are believers in his signs
why should you not eat of that over which allah has mentioned while he has explained to you what is forbidden to you unless you are constrained to it
many lead astray without their knowledge
your lord knows best the transgressors
forsake the outward sin and sin shall be witnessed for what they have done
do not eat of that over which allah s name has not been mentioned it is indeed a sin for you
the devils inspire their friends to dispute with you
if you obey them you will be idolaters
is he who was dead and we gave him life and made for him a light whereby he walketh among the people like him who blunders out of darkness out of darkness into light
thus it is made fairseeming unto the disbelievers that which they used to do
and thus we have placed in every city a great number of its wicked ones
but they plot not except against themselves but they perceive it not
when a sign comes to them they say we will not believe until we are given the like of what was given to the messengers of allah
allah knows best where to place his apostleship
humiliation from allah and severe torment will overtake the criminals for what they used to devise
whomsoever allah willeth he expandeth his breast to islam and whomsoever he willeth he sendeth astray narrow for whomsoever he willeth and maketh his breast narrow tight strait narrow as though he were climbing
thus does allah put a seal upon those who believe
this is the straight path of your lord
we have detailed our revelations for a people who reflect
for them is the home of peace with their lord
he will be their guardian for what they used to do
on the day when he will gather them together he will say o lord you have enticed a people for whom your fathers have seduced the kingdom of jinns and men will say our lord we have made for mankind a good example for you and your fathers the
thus we make some of the wrongdoers befriend one another
o company of jinn and humans have not reached you from among you relating to you my verses and warning you of the encounter of this day of yours
they will say we bear witness against ourselves
they will say we testify against ourselves
they will testify against themselves that they were unbelievers
that is because your lord would not destroy the cities unjustly while their people were unaware
for all there is degrees of deeds which he has done and your lord is not unaware of what they do
your lord is the rich the praised
if he wills he can remove you and bring you into another people as he raised you from the seed of others
surely what you are promised will come to pass and you will not find in it any escape
say o my people act according to your station i am acting in your power and you will know whose end is the abode of the hereafter
and they assign to allah a share of the crops and cattle and cattle and they say this is for allah so they assert their share this is for our associategods
and what is for their partners reaches allah while the socalled partners of allah reaches their partners
evil is what they judge
thus fairseeming their associategods have made many of the mushrikun polytheists pagans idolaters disbelievers in the oneness of allah polytheists pagans idolaters etc have made their killing of makkah to ruin and to destroy them
and if allah had willed they would not have done so
so leave them alone with their fabrications
and they say these cattle and these crops are consecrated to whom we will destroy them and their offspring
they are forbidden to keep their backs and they are forbidden so do not pronounce the name of allah over their cattle
they have appointed partners to allah
he will recompense them for what they fabricate
and they say what is in the bellies of these cattle is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our wives
but if it is stillborn they will be convinced
he will recompense them for their describing
he is allwise allknowing
they are losers who slay their children foolishly without knowledge and forbid what allah has provided for them inventing lies against allah
they have gone astray and are not guided
it is he who produces gardens trellised and untrellised palmtrees and crops diverse and olives and pomegranates similar and dissimilar
eat of their fruit when they fructify and pay the due thereof on the day of its harvest and do not waste
and of the cattle he has reared some for burden and some for burden
eat of what allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of shaitan satan
he is your manifest enemy
eight couples two of sheep two of goats two of goats
say is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain
inform me with knowledge if you are truthful
and the camels and the two of oxen two females say “ what is in the two males of the two females or what is contained in the wombs of the two females ”
or were you witnesses when allah enjoined this upon you
who then could be more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against allah so he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge
indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
say “ i do not find anything forbidden to be forbidden to anyone who eats food except carrion or spilled blood spilled blood or flesh dedicated to other than allah
but whosoever is driven by necessity neither desiring nor transgressing verily your lord is forgiving merciful
and to those who are jews we forbade every animal with claws and forbade the fat of oxen and sheep except what is borne by their backs or their entrails or what is attached to their bones
that is how we requited them for their rebellion and indeed we are truthful
if they deny you say your lord is possessor of extensive mercy but his punishment will not be averted from the guilty people
the idolaters will say had allah willed we would not have ascribed to him nor would we have forbidden anything
likewise belied the messengers before them
say have you any knowledge that you can produce before us
you follow nothing but conjectures and you do nothing but surmise ’
say to allah belongs the conclusive argument
had he wished he would have guided you all
say bring your witnesses who can testify that allah forbade suchandsuch
so if they testify do not testify with them and do not follow the desires of those who deny our signs and those who do not believe in the hereafter and those who equate others with their lord
say come i will recite to you that you associate with him and do not associate anything with him in your lord and do not abandon your parents to parents
and do not approach immoralities what you do is unlawful
and slay not the soul which allah hath forbidden
that he has charged you with haply you will remember
and do not approach the property of the orphan except with the best intentions until he reaches maturity
and do not burden the measure and the balance with justice
and when you speak be fair even if it concerns a near relative
and fulfil your covenant
that he may remember you haply you will remember
this is my straight path
and do not follow other paths lest they divert you from his path
that he may make you clear to yourselves
then we gave moses the book completing the deeds of his followers and a guidance and grace for every nation that they may believe in the encounter with their lord and that they may believe in the encounter with their lord
and this is a blessed book which we have sent down
follow it and be wary of allah so that you may receive mercy
lest you should say the book was sent down only to two groups before us and we were unaware of their teachings
or lest you should say if only the book had been sent down to us we would have been better guided than they
so now there has now come to you a clear proof from your lord and a guidance and a mercy
who then is more unjust than he who denies the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah and turns away from them
anon we shall requite those who turn away from our messages with a torment afflictive for their turning away
are they waiting for anything but that the angels should come to them or your lord to appear or that your lord should come or some of them or some of your lord s signs ’ or your lord s signs ’ may come
on the day when some of your lord s signs arrives no soul will have believed before its belief or earned good deeds that it had earned no good or earned before it
say wait we too are waiting
indeed those who split up their religion and became sects you have nothing to do with them
their case rests with allah then he will inform them of what they used to do
whoever brings a good deed will receive ten times and will be repaid with the like of it
and whosoever does an evil deed will not be wronged in the least and they will not be wronged
say “ my lord has guided me to a straight path the religion of abraham the upright who was not a polytheist ”
say my prayer my ritual sacrifice my living and my dying are all for allah the lord of the creation
no associate has he
and this i have been commanded and i am the first of those who submit themselves to allah
say shall i seek a lord other than allah while he is the lord of all things
no soul earns it except what it earns
no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another
then to your lord is your return and he will inform you concerning what you used to differ
it is he who has made you caliphs in the earth and raised some of you above others in rank that he may try you in what he has given you
verily your lord is swift in chastising and verily he is forgiving merciful
alif lam mim sad
this is a book sent down to you so let them find what is revealed to you
it is not for you to warn thereby and to warn thereby a reminder
follow what has been revealed to you from your lord and do not follow other than him
little do you recollect
how many a township we have destroyed
our punishment came upon them at night or while they were sleeping
and when our might came upon them they said we were indeed wrongdoers
we will question those to whom we will and we will question the messengers
then we shall narrate unto them with knowledge and we were not absent
and the weighing of deeds that day will be the truth
and he whose scales are heavy they are the successful
and those whose scales are light those are the ones who have lost their souls because they used to mistreat our revelations
and we have established you on the earth and appointed for you therein livelihoods
little do you give thanks
we created you then we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam and we said to the angels prostrate yourselves
they prostrated except iblis he was not one of those who prostrated
he said what prevented you from prostrating when i commanded you
he said i am better than him thou createdst me of fire and him thou createdst of clay
he said “ get down from hence – it is not for you to be arrogant here
so get out for you are one of the humiliated
he said respite me till the day they are raised up
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
he said since you have seduced me i will sit in ambush for them on your straight path
then i will come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right and from their left and you will not find most of them thankful
he said begone hence blameful and banished
whoever of them follows you i will fill hell with you all together
and adam inhabit the garden and eat from every enemy and eat freely whencesoever you will but do not approach this tree lest you become wrongdoers
then satan whispered to them that which was hidden from them and he said your lord has made clear to you that you become immortals
and he swore to them “ i am your wellwisher ”
so he made them enter deception
and when they tasted of the tree their shame became apparent to them and they began to stitch over themselves with the leaves of paradise
their lord called out to them saying did i not forbid you from that tree and tell you that satan is an open enemy to you
they said our lord we have wronged ourselves
if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us we will be among the losers
he said get down each of you an enemy to each other and a place of stay on earth for a while
he said “ in it you will live and in it you will die and from it you will be raised ”
o children of adam
that is the garment of allah that is better for you so that they may take heed
o children of adam let not satan tempt you as he removed your parents from the garden stripping them of their garments to expose their nakedness
he and his descendants will see you from where you can not see them
we have made the devils friends of those who do not believe
and when they commit an indecency they said we found our fathers doing it
say allah has commanded us to do so
say thou allah commandeth not that which ye know not
say my lord ordered justice
say ‘ i turn your face toward him at every place of worship and call upon him at every place of worship
so worship him and dedicate your religion to him
as he originated you you will return
a group of mankind he has guided and a part of them have deserved the truth while they have departed from the right way and they think that they are rightlyguided
o children of adam take your adornment at every place of worship and eat and drink but waste not the prodigal verily allah loveth not the prodigal
say who has forbidden the adornment of allah which he has produced for his servants and the good things of his providing
say these are for the believers in the life of this world but the exclusively of the believers will be theirs on the day of resurrection
thus do we detail the revelations for people who know
say my lord has forbidden repugnant acts whether apparent or disguised sin and sin and oppression and sin and disobedience and to allah that you associate with allah that which he has sent down no authority
and every nation has its term when their term comes they will not delay it nor will they precede it
o children of adam when messengers come to you from amongst you who narrate to you my verses then whosoever fears allah and reforms there shall be no fear concerning them nor shall they grieve
but those who deny our revelations and are disdainful of them shall be the inmates of the fire and they shall remain in it forever
who is more wicked than he who invents a lie about allah or belies his verses
their portion of the book shall reach them until when our messengers come to them the angels take away their souls they will say where are they who used to worship besides allah they will say they have abandoned us away from allah and they bear witness against themselves
he will say enter the fire and join the nations of jinn before you
every time a nation enters it curses its sisternation and curse him to the last of the last day
when they all of them all were in it they will say ‘ our lord
these led us astray so give us double torment of the fire
he will say for each one there is double torment but you know not
the first of them will say to the last of them you have no merit for us so taste the punishment for what you used to earn
those who deny our signs and are disdainful of arrogance for them will not be opened for them the gates of heaven nor will they enter paradise until the camel passes through the needle s eye ’
thus do we recompense the guilty
hell will be their cradle and over them coverings of fire
thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
and those who believe and do good deeds we charge no soul except according to its capacity they are the inhabitants of paradise where they will abide for ever
we will remove whatever rancor is in their hearts
rivers will flow beneath them and they will say praise be to allah who has guided us to this
had allah not guided us we would have been guided
the messengers of our lord had come with the truth
and it will be said this is the paradise which you used to do
and the inhabitants of paradise will call to the companions of the fire and say to the people of the garden we have found our lord true
now have ye found the promise of your lord which ye have promised
they will say yes “ yes ”
who bar from the way of allah and seek to make it crooked and who disbelieve in the hereafter
between them is a veil and on the ramparts are men who mark
they will not go to it but they will not be entered it
and when their eyes are turned towards the companions of the fire they will say our lord place us not with the wrongdoing people
and the dwellers on the ramparts call to men they recognize by their marks saying your amassing wealth and your numbers availed you not
are these the ones whom you swore that allah will not extend them to be your mercy
enter paradise no fear shall be on you nor shall you grieve
the companions of the fire will call out to the dwellers of the fire pour out on us water or some water that allah has provided you
they will say “ god has forbidden them ”
and those who took their religion as a sport and play and whose amusement had deceived them until the worldly life of this day we shall forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs
we have brought them a book which we expounded to show them a guidance and mercy for a people who believe
are they waiting for the fulfilment thereof
the day when the fulfilment of its fulfillment comes those who had ignored it before will say the messengers of our lord had come to us
will we then believe in any way we have forgotten so that we may act righteously differently from the way we had done
they have lost their souls and that which they used to invent has failed them
indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days then he established himself above the throne he covers the night and the day and he subjected the sun and the moon each moving subservient to his command
lo his is the creation and commandment
blessed is allah the lord of the worlds
supplicate to your lord with humility and secret
he does not love the aggressors
do not make mischief in the earth after it has been set in it and call upon him with fear and hope
indeed the mercy of allah is near to the doers of good
it is he who sends the winds as harbingers of his mercy
then when they have carried clouds we drive them to a dead land and we drive them to a dead land and bring forth therewith fruits
thus will we raise the dead
haply ye may remember
and the good land its vegetation comes forth by the leave of its lord and that which is bad only scantily
thus do we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for a people who give thanks
we sent noah to his people
he said o my people worship allah
i fear for you the chastisement of a mighty day
the chiefs of his people said verily we see thee in error manifest
he said o my people there is no error in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
i convey to you the messages of my lord and give you sincere advice
and i know from allah what you do not know
or do you wonder that a reminder from your lord has come to you and that you may warn a man from amongst you and that you may fear him and that you may receive mercy
but they denied him
so we saved him and those with him in the ark and we drowned those who denied our signs
they were a blind people
and to ad we sent their brother hud he said o my people worship allah you have no god other than him so will you not fear him
the chiefs of his people who disbelieved said verily we see thee in folly and verily we think thou art of the liars
he said o my people there is no folly in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
i convey unto you the messages of my lord and i am your adviser sincere
or do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your lord through a man from amongst you
and remember how he made you successors after the people of noah and increased you amply amply in stature
so remember the bounties of allah so that you may be successful
they said have you come to us to worship allah that which our fathers worshipped
then bring us that thou promisest us if thou speakest truly
he said “ condemnation and indignation from your lord
do you dispute with me concerning names which you have named you and your fathers
they have no authority for them
wait then i am waiting with you
so we saved him and those with him by mercy from us and we cut off the root of those who denied our signs and were not believers
and to thamood we sent their brother salih
he said o my people worship allah you have no god other than him
there has come to you a clear proof from your lord
this shecamel of allah is a sign for you and leave her to graze freely in the land and do not touch her with evil lest you should be seized by a painful punishment
remember when he made you successors after ad and gave you habitations in the land you build for yourselves palaces in the plains and carve out dwellings in the mountains
so remember god s bounties ’ and do not act mischievously in the earth ’
the chiefs of his people who were arrogant said unto those who believed among them ye know that salih is sent from his lord
they said “ in what he has been sent with ”
those who were arrogant said verily we disbelieve in that which you believe
so they hamstrung the shecamel and defied the command of their lord and said bring us that which you threaten us with if you should be one of the messengers
so the earthquake seized them and they lay prostrate in their homes
so he turned away from them and said o my people i conveyed to you the message of my lord and advised you but you do not like advisors
and lot when he said to his people do you commit such as no creature in the world
you approach men lustfully instead of women
nay but ye are a people transgressing
but the only answer of his people was only that they said expel them from your city they are people who keep themselves pure
so we saved him and his family except his wife she was one of those who remained behind
and we rained down upon them a rain of stones
so see how was the end of the criminals
and to midian we sent their brother shu aib
he said o my people worship allah you have no god other than him
there has come to you a clear proof from your lord
so give full measure and weight and do not cheat the people of their goods and do not cheat the earth after its restoration
that is better for you if you are believers
and do not sit on every road threatening and barring from the path of allah those who believe in him seeking to make it crooked
and remember when you were few and he increased you in number
so note the consequences for the corrupters
if there be a group among you who believe in what i have sent down to you and do not believe until i have patience until allah judges between us
he is the best of those who judge
the chiefs of his people who were scornful said o shu ayb we will expel you from our town or else you will return to our religion
he said even though we detest it
we shall have invented a lie against allah if we returned to your religion after allah has saved us from it we should not return it to it unless we should be fabricating lies against allah our lord
our lord embraces all things in his knowledge
in allah we place our trust
our lord judge between us and our people for you are the best of deciders
the chiefs of his people who disbelieved said if ye follow shu aib then ye will be losers
so the earthquake seized them and they lay prostrate in their homes
those who belied shu aib became as if they had never dwelt there
those who belied shu aib they were the losers
so he turned away from them and said o my people i conveyed to you the message of my lord and gave you good advice
how can i grieve for a people who do not believe
and we sent not a prophet to any city but we sent its people to drink and adversity and adversity so that they might humble themselves
then we changed the evil in place of hardship until they multiplied and said tribulation and adversity befell us
so we seized them suddenly while they were unaware
and had the people of the towns believed and feared allah we would have opened for them blessings from the sky and the earth
but they belied so we seized them for what they used to earn
do the people of the towns feel secure from our punishment overtaking them at night while they are asleep
or do the people of the towns feel secure from our punishment overtaking them while they play
do they feel secure from allah s plan ’
none feels secure from allah s plan ’ except the people who are losers
is it not a guidance for those who inherit the land after its previous inhabitants that had we willed we could have punished them for their sins and we seal their hearts so that they hear not
these are the towns whose account we narrate to you
their messengers came to them with clear signs but they were not to believe in what they had denied before
thus does allah seal up the hearts of the faithless
we found no loyalty to covenants
nay but they found most of them ungodly
then after them we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his council but they wronged themselves
so see what sort of fate befell the mischiefmakers
and moses said o pharaoh i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
approved for me only to say nothing about god
i bring you a clear sign from your lord that you have come with me
he said “ if you have brought a sign then bring it forth if you are truthful ”
so moses threw his staff and suddenly it was a serpent manifest
then he drew out his hand and behold it was white to the onlookers
the notables of pharaoh s people said verily this is a wellversed sorcerer
who seeks to expel you from your land
what do you advise
they said put him off and his brother and send callers to the cities callers
to bring you every expert magician ’
and the magicians came to pharaoh they said “ shall we be a reward if we are the victors ”
he said yes and you will be among those brought near to me
they said moses will you throw first or we shall be the ones to throw
he said cast ye down
so when they threw they bewitched the eyes of the people and terrified them and produced a mighty magic
and we inspired moses saying throw down your staff and it swallowed up their false invention
so the truth came to pass and what they had been doing was annulled
so they were vanquished there and they turned back humiliated
and the magicians fell down prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of the worlds
the lord of moses and aaron
pharaoh said you have believed in him before i permit you to kill moses but you have already come to pharaoh in the city that you may expel the people of lot
you will come to know
i will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and then crucify you all
they said “ we will return to our lord
and you are vindictive toward us only because we believed in the signs of our lord when they came to us
our lord pour out us patience into perseverance and cause us to die as muslims
the elders of pharaoh s people said will you leave moses and his people to spread mischief in the land and to abandon you and your gods
he said we will kill their sons and spare their women and we are indeed masters over them
moses said to his people seek help in god and be patient
the earth belongs to god he gives it to whomever he wills of his servants
and the sequel is for the pious
they said we have suffered troubles before you came to us and after you came to us
he said perhaps your lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land and see how you will do
and we afflicted the people of pharaoh with famine and dearth of fruits that haply they may take heed
but whenever good came to them they said “ this is ours ” and when misfortune befell them they ascribed it to moses and those who were with him
indeed their evil augury was with allah but most of them do not know
they said “ you have come to us with whatever sign we will not believe in you ”
so we sent upon them floods locusts lice frogs and blood and the blood of the manifest signs
they were arrogant and they were a people who were faithless
and when a plague smote them they said o moses pray to your lord for us
if thou removest from us the chastisement we will surely believe in thee and let the children of israel go with thee
but when we removed the punishment from them until a term which they had been to reach they broke their promise
so we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea for they denied our signs and were heedless of them
and we made the people who were persecuted the eastern and western lands which we had blessed
and the word of your lord was fulfilled for the children of israel because of their endurance
and we destroyed all that pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had harvested
and we brought the children of israel across the sea and they came upon a people devoted to idols
they said o musa moses
make for us a god as they have gods
he said “ you are a people who do not know ”
verily these are they whom they are engaged in the fire and all that they have been doing is vain
he said shall i seek for you a god other than allah when he has preferred you above all beings
and remember when we saved you from pharaoh s people who were afflicting you with a terrible chastisement slaughtering your sons and sparing your women and in that was a great trial from your lord
and we made moses thirty nights and completed them with ten nights and the term of forty nights
and moses said to his brother “ go straight and do not follow the way of my brother and do not follow the path of the mischiefmakers ”
and when moses came to our appointment we found our trust in him and his lord spoke to him
he said my lord show me my self
he said “ you will not see me ”
but see alas for a fear
if it were to fall upon its dead earth it would be of those who have been able to see me
and when his lord unveiled his glory to the mountain he crushed it with a swoon of his rod
and he said glory be to you
and i turn unto thee repentant and i am the foremost of those who believe
he said o moses i have chosen you above all mankind and my messages
so take what i have given you and be among the thankful
and we wrote for him in the tablets the lesson for him and the explanation of all things and explanation of all things and command and command them to take the path of allah and to instruct you in it
i will turn away from my signs those who wax proud in the earth wrongfully and they will not believe therein
and if they see the way of consciousness they will not adopt it as a way for themselves and if they see the path of error they will adopt it as a way of error
that is because they denied our signs and were heedless to them
those who deny our revelations and the meeting of the hereafter their works have failed
are they requited aught save what they used to do
and the people of moses took up after him in his absence a calf from their ornaments a body
did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way
they took it for worship and they were wrongdoers
and when they regretted and saw that they had gone astray they said “ if our lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us we will be among the losers ”
and when moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said what is your business and what an evil thing you have done
would you hasten the decree of your lord
and he threw down the tablets and he took hold of his brother s head dragging him to himself
he said son of my mother aaron said o son of my mother verily aaron
do not let my enemies rejoice over me and do not number me among the wrongdoing people ’
he said my lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into your mercy for you are the most merciful of the merciful
indeed those who took the calf for worship wrath from their lord and humiliation in the life of the world
thus do we requite those who invent lies
but those who committed evils and repented after they believed and then repented after they believed and thereafter accepted faith
and when the anger of moses abated he took up the tablets
inscribed upon them is guidance and mercy for those who fear their lord
and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment
and when the tremor shook them he said my lord
if you had so willed you could have destroyed them before this
it is not a thing except what you have done
you will not guide whomever you will and guide whomever he wills
you alone are our maula lord
forgive us and have mercy on us you are the best of those who show mercy
and ordain for us in this world and in the hereafter he said i have turned to you in repentance and i will prescribe it for my mercy and my mercy encompasses all things and i will ordain it for those who fear my signs and who will give
those who follow the messenger the unlettered prophet who follow the messenger and whom they find written down with them in the torah and the gospel
he will forbid them from evils and forbid evil and prohibit the good things which is bad and the shackles that were upon them and the shackles that were upon them and the fetters of their burdens
he who believes in him and succour him and succour him and follow him and those who have been with him are the prosperers
say o mankind i am the messenger of allah to you all of him to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
he gives life and causes death
so believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and the messenger muhammad saw and the quran which has revealed to him muhammad saw and follow the words of allah and his words that you may be guided
and of moses there is a nation who guide the truth and they were witnesses to it
and we divided them twelve tribes to twelve leaders when we revealed to moses saying smite the rock with your staff
and the rock gushed forth from it twelve springs
and we shaded them with clouds and we sent down upon them manna and quails “ eat of the good things we have provided you ”
they wronged us not but they used to wrong themselves
and when it was said to them dwell in this township and eat from it wherever you wish and say unburdening and enter the gate prostrating in your trespasses we will forgive you your sins and increase the doers of good
but the wrongdoers changed the word of allah for another saying which had been told them
so we sent down upon them a plague from the sky for their evil deeds
ask them about the village about the sea
when they violated the sabbath they sabbath allah s bounds ’
but when the sabbath came to pass they were on a day in their sabbath swimming swimming in order to come to them
thus we tried them because they disobeyed
and when a section among them said why do you admonish a people whom allah has sent down to destroy or punish severely they said “ perhaps they may be warned ”
so when they forgot that which they had been reminded we saved those who forbade evil and seized the wrongdoers with a terrible punishment
consequently when they rebelled against the command of allah they said to them be apes despised
and remember when your lord proclaimed that he would send against them until the day of resurrection those who would inflict on them a terrible punishment
indeed your lord is swift in retribution
and indeed he is the forgiving the merciful
and we dispersed them in communities on the earth some of them are righteous and some of them are otherwise
and we tested them with fortunes and misfortunes so that they may return
then after them succeeded them who inherited the scripture and they inherited the goods of this lower world saying we shall be forgiven
and if there comes to them a opportunity for acquiring they would grab them like they would again eat
did they not make the covenant of the book say about allah that they did not know anything in the book nor did they change it
and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who ward off evil
will you not understand
and those who hold fast to the book and establish prayer we shall not waste the hire of the rectifiers
and when we shook the mountain above them as if it were a canopy and they thought that it would fall upon them a part of the sky
and we said take hold of clouds and remember that which is in it that you may ward off evil
and recall what time thy lord took from them their own selves saying i am not a witness against them and they said i am not a witness over you lest ye should say lo we were witnesses of this
or lest you should say “ our forefathers ascribed partners to allah before and we were descendants after them
will you destroy us for what the falsifiers have done ’
thus do we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc in detail so that they may return
and recite to them the story of him to whom we gave our signs but he sloughed them off so satan followed him and he became one of the perverts
had we willed we could have raised him up but he clung to the earth and followed his lust
his likeness is that of a dog if you chase him he hangs out his tongue out and if you leave him alone he lolls out his tongue out
such is the likeness of the people who deny our signs
narrate to them o muhammad saw that they may reflect
evil is the parable of the people who deny our signs and wrong themselves
he whom allah guides is rightly guided and whomever he wishes — it is they who are the losers
we have created many of the jinns and mankind
they have hearts with which they do not understand
they are like cattle nay but they perceive not
they are like cattle nay they are in fact more
these are the neglectful
to allah belong the best names
so call him by the names of those who blaspheme his names and leave them to utter ruin
they will be requited for what they used to do
and of those we created there are a nation who guide the truth and act justly according to the truth
and those who cry lies to our signs we shall draw them on little by little whence they know not
i respite them my plan is firm
do they not ponder how their companion is not mad
he is but a plain warner
have they not observed the government of the heavens and the earth and what things allah created and that it may be that their term may be nigh
so in what statement after this will they believe advent of the hereafter
whomever allah leads astray has none to guide them he leaves them bewildered in their transgression
they ask you about the hour when will it come
say knowledge thereof is with my lord only
none can reveal it except he
it is heavy in the heavens and the earth
it will not come upon you except suddenly ”
they ask you as if you were a good knowledge of it
say knowledge thereof is with allah but most people do not know
say i have no power to benefit or hurt except what allah wills
had i knowledge of the unseen i would have acquired much good and no harm would have touched me
i am only a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe
it is he who created you from a single soul and made its mate that he might reside in her
when he covered her she bore a light burden and continues her burden
and when it yields its prayer they both prayed “ if you give us a child we will give thanks to you and be among the thankful ”
but when he gave them a healthy child they ascribed partners to him in respect of what he had given them
high be allah exalted above all that they associate with him
do they associate others with allah in his divinity and are themselves created
and they can neither help them nor help themselves
and if you call them to guidance they will not follow you
it is the same for you whether you invite them or you are silent
those whom you call upon besides allah are creatures like you and call upon them answer you if you are truthful
do they have feet to walk with or have they hands wherewith they hold or have they eyes with which they see
say call upon your socalled partners of allah and set out your plot against me and do not give me respite
my protector is god who has sent down the book and he protects the righteous
and those whom you invoke besides him can not help you nor can they help themselves
if you call them to guidance they will not hear
you see them looking at you but they do not see
adopt forgiveness enjoin what is right and enjoin what is right and turn away from the ignorant
and if an evil whisper comes to you from shaitan satan then seek refuge in allah
allah is hearer knower
when the godfearing are instigated by an impulse from satan they remember allah and behold they perceive
their brothers who went astray into error and then they do not stop short
and when you do not bring a verse they say why do you not improvise one
say i follow only what is revealed to me from my lord
this qur an ’ is a clear proof from your lord and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
when the qur an is recited listen to it and do not be silent so that you may receive mercy
and remember your lord within your hearts humbly and fearfully and quietly and quietly and be not of the neglectful
those who are with your lord are not too proud to worship him
they glorify him and prostrate themselves
they ask you about the spoils of war
say the spoils belong to allah and the messenger
so fear allah and adjust your difference and obey allah and his messenger if you are believers
the believers are those whose hearts tremble when allah is mentioned and when his verses are recited to them they increase their faith in their lord and in their lord they put their trust
who perform assalat iqamatassalat and spend out of what we have provided them
such are true believers
they have high ranks with their lord and forgiveness and a generous provision
as your lord brought you forth from your home with the truth while you were averse to it
arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear as if they were being driven to death
and when allah promised you one of the two parties one of the other and you wished that it should be yours and you wished to be yours
but allah wanted to prove by his words and to root out the faithless to sever the truth
that he may prove the truth and abolish falsehood even though the guilty should be averse
when you appealed to your lord for help he answered i will help you with a thousand angels in succession
allah made it not except as a good tidings and that your hearts may be satisfied
victory comes only from allah
allah is mighty wise
when he made drowsiness slumber fall upon you as a security from him and he sent down water from the sky and cleanse you thereby and remove from you the pollution of satan and cleanse your hearts and steady your feet
and remember when your lord inspired the angels i am with you
so make firm the believers
i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve so smite them with terror into their hearts
that is because they opposed allah and his apostle
and whosoever opposeth allah and his messenger then verily allah is severe in retribution
that is for the unbelievers wherefore taste it and the chastisement of the fire
o you who believe when you encounter the unbelievers marching to battle turn not your backs to them
and whosoever turns his back on them unless he turns away on them or wriggling as a strategy or a company of his wrath is hell and what an evil destination
it was you who killed them but it was not allah who killed them
and you launched not when you launched but allah launched
that he might bestow upon the believers a good favour
allah is hearer knower
that is the case and know that allah will weaken the scheme of the disbelievers
if you besought the judgement then yours is a verdict
and if you desist it will be better for you
if you return we will return
we will increase your forces however numerous it may be and if you will avail them indeed allah is with the believers
o you who believe obey allah and his messenger and do not turn away from him when you are hearing
and do not be like those who say we hear and they do not hear
verily the worst of moving living creatures in the sight of allah are the deaf and dumb who do not understand
had allah known any good in them he would have made them hear
but he would have made them hear and they would still turn away
o you who believe respond to allah and respond to him when he calls you to what allah has given you
know that allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that you will be gathered
and fear a trial which will not smite the wrongdoers among you exclusively and know that allah is severe in chastising
and remember when you were few and powerless in the land but few in number of years that they might take you away men
so he provided you shelter and provided you with good things so that you may be grateful
o you who believe do not betray allah and his messenger and do not betray your trusts while you know
and know that your possessions and your children are a trial and that with allah is a mighty wage
o you who believe if you fear allah he will grant you a criterion and will appoint for you a light
allah is the possessor of great bounty
and remember when the disbelievers plotted against you or kill you or evict you from makkah
they planned but allah planned and allah is the best of planners
when our verses are recited to them they say we have heard
if we willed we could have said “ nothing but the like of this ”
and when they said o allah if this be the truth from you then rain down upon us stones from heaven or bring us a painful punishment
but allah would not punish them while you are amongst them while you are in their midst
but why should allah punish them when they debar men from the sacred mosque although they are not its guardians
its guardians are only for the pious but most of them do not know
their prayer at the house is nothing but whistling and handclapping
so taste the punishment for your denying the truth
those who disbelieve spend their wealth to bar from the way of allah
they will spend it then it will become a regret for them and then they will be overcome
and those who disbelieve will be gathered unto hell
that god may distinguish the bad from the good and link the corrupt from the corrupt and pile them together and cast them into gehenna
these are the losers
say to those who disbelieve if they cease to the messenger after their prescribed period of belief will be forgiven them
but if they persist in the past then the example of the ancients has passed away
fight them until persecution is no more and religion becomes exclusively for allah
but if they cease then know that allah is seeing of what they do
but if they turn away know that allah is your maula patron lord helper and protector etc and an excellent helper
know that whatever you send down to allah belongs to the messenger and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer if you have believed in allah and the messenger and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the wayfarer in allah s cause and the wayfarer
allah is able to do all things
and recall what time ye were on the hither side and they were on the yonder side and they were on the yonder side
and if a near man would fain stay at the place of the caravan would have been made to pass
if you had sought to meet an appointment for you would have missed you to be ruined but allah has decreed a clear proof for the believers and he has restrained the evidence of the believers in his right hands and that they might perish
allah is hearer knower
and recall what time allah shewed them in thy dream few in thy dream if he had shown thee to forget the affair would have been in respect thereof
but allah saved you from the situation in the breasts
and remember when you met them in your eyes when allah made you appear as few in your eyes and allah made you appear in their eyes so that you might be returned to allah with the matters in return
to allah all matters are referred
o believers when you meet a host stand firm and remember god frequently haply you will prosper
obey allah and his messenger
do you expect that you will be unmanned and lose heart
indeed allah is with the patient
and do not be like those who left their homes boastfully showing off from the way of allah and from the way of allah
he is aware of what they do
and remember when shaitan satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said i am your master and i am your master
but when the two armies faced each other he turned in flight saying i am quit of you for i see not the treacherous
i fear allah and allah is severe in retribution
when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is sickness said their religion has deluded these people
but whoever puts his trust in allah allah will surely find allah allmighty allwise
if you could see when the angels take away the souls of the unbelievers beating their faces and their backs saying taste the punishment of burning
that is because of what your hands have sent ahead
and allah is not unjust to his servants
like the behavior of pharaoh and those before them
they denied the signs of allah so allah seized them for their sins
indeed allah is allstrong severe in retribution
that is because allah does not change a grace which he has bestowed upon any people until they change what is within themselves
allah is hearer knower
like the behavior of pharaoh s people and those before them they denied the revelations of their lord so we destroyed them for their sins
and we drowned the people of pharaoh s pharaoh people
all were wrongdoers
verily the worst of moving creatures in the sight of allah are those who disbelieve they will not believe
those with whom you made a treaty and who violated their treaty every time and then they do not fear allah
so if you leave them in battle to disperse those behind them in war disperse those who fear that they may take admonition
if you apprehend treachery from any people with whom you have covenanted with them equally
indeed allah does not like traitors
and let not the disbelievers suppose that they can outstrip them they can not frustrate allah
prepare against them whatever you can muster them and whatever you can muster allah s enemies ’ and your enemy ’ and your enemy ’ and others besides them whom you do not know
whatever you spend in the way of allah will be repaid to you and you will not be wronged
if they incline to peace then you too incline toward it and put your trust in allah
indeed he is the hearing the knowing
and if they desire to deceive you allah is sufficient for you
it is he who strengthened you with his help and with the believers
and brought their hearts together
hadst thou expended all that is in the earth thou couldst not have produced harmony but god united them he is allmighty allwise
0 prophet sufficient for you is allah and those who follow you
o prophet urge upon the believers to fight
if there are twenty steadfast persons among you they will overcome two hundred and if there be a hundred of you they will overcome two thousand of you
verily they are a people who do not understand
now allah has lightened your burden for he knows that there is weakness in you
if there are a hundred steadfast persons among you they will overcome two hundred and if there be a thousand of you they will overcome two thousand by allah s leave
and allah is with the patient
it behoves not for any prophet to take prisoners until he has sufficiently suppressed the faithless
you desire the materials of this world but god desires for you the hereafter
allah is mighty wise
had it not been for a decree from allah a mighty decree would have touched you for what you took a grievous punishment
so eat of what you have made lawful and good and lawful for them
and fear allah verily allah is forgiving merciful
say to the captives who are taken away from allah if he finds you something better than what has been taken from you and he will forgive you
allah is forgiving merciful
but if they desire to betray you they have already betrayed allah before
so he gave you power over them
allah is allknowing allwise
those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of allah with their wealth and lives and lives and those who sheltered and helped them are allies of one another
and those who believed but did not migrate you have no relation with you until they emigrate to marry their homes
but if they ask you for help in the way of religion then you must help them except against a people with whom you have a treaty
and allah is allseer of what you do
and those who disbelieve are allies of one another
unless you do this there will be discord in the land and great corruption
those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of allah and those who gave shelter and helped them these are the true believers
for them is forgiveness and noble provision
and those who believed afterwards and emigrated and struggled with you
but those who are nearer to one another in respect of blood relationship
allah has knowledge of all things
a declaration of immunity from allah and his messenger to those with whom you have made a treaty
so travel freely in the land for four months and know that you can not frustrate allah in the least
allah will disgrace us in this world and in the hereafter
and a proclamation from allah and his messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage allah is free of all wants and his messenger
but if you repent it will be better for you but if you turn away know that you can not frustrate allah
and give tidings o muhammad saw to the unbelievers of a painful punishment
excepting those of the idolaters with whom you have made a treaty and who have not subsequently failed you against any human being supported
fulfil your treaty with them till the end of their term
indeed allah loves the godwary
so when the sacred months have passed kill the polytheists wherever you find them and besiege them and lie in wait for them and besiege them and prepare for them
but if they repent and maintain the prayer and give zakah let them go their way
allah is forgiving merciful
and if any of the idolaters seeks asylum grant him asylum until he hears the word of allah
then escort him to the place of safety for they are a people who do not know
how can there be a treaty with allah and his messenger except those with whom you made a treaty at the sacred mosque
so long as they are true to you so be upright with them
indeed allah loves the righteous
how can they prevail over you when they respect neither kinship nor treaty nor treaty
they please you with their mouths while their hearts refuse and most of them are transgressors
they have sold the signs of allah for a small price and bar others from his path
evil is what they used to do
they respect neither kinship nor treaty
it is they who are the transgressors
but if they repent and maintain the prayer and give the zakat then they are your brethren in faith
we detail the revelations for a people who know
and if they break their pledges after their treaty and attack you and fight the leaders of disbelief for they have no welcome to fight the sacred mosque
maybe you will desist
will you not fight a people who broke their pledges and purposed to expel the messenger beginning the first time and initiated hostilities against you
do you fear them if you fear them you would fear them
fight them allah will punish them by your hands and degrade them and degrade you against them and heal the breasts of a believing people
and remove the anger of their hearts
allah accepts the repentance of whomever he wills and allah is allknowing allwise
or do you think that you will be left alone while allah has not made friendship and left his messenger and those who fought among you will not befriend the believers
and allah is allaware of what you do
it is not for the idolaters to inhabit god s mosques bearing witness against themselves
their works have failed and in the fire they shall abide
only those who believe in allah and the last day and maintain the prayer and pay the zakat and maintain the prayer and give the zakat and fear allah and do not be afraid of allah except the true believers
do you consider providing water to the pilgrims and tending the sacred mosque and the same as one who believes in allah and the last day and struggles in the way of allah
they are not equal with allah
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
those who believe and migrated and waged jihad with their possessions and their persons are in the way of allah and those who have struggled with their wealth and their lives in the sight of allah and it is they who are the triumphant
their lord gives them glad tidings of mercy from him and approval and gardens of lasting bliss
they will abide therein and ever surely with god is a mighty wage
o believers do not befriend your fathers and brothers if they prefer disbelief to disbelief those who are the harmdoers
say if your fathers your sons your brothers your brothers your brothers your brothers and your brothers and your tribe and the wealth you fear allah and his messenger and the struggling you are dearer to you than allah and his messenger and striving until you see allah s
allah does not guide the sinful people
allah has helped you on many a battlefield
and remember the number of the days of the battle of hunain when the earth vast as it was straitened for you and the retreat of the disbelievers were not in the land and the sea turned towards you and you turned back and fled
then allah sent down his calm upon his messenger and upon the believers and sent down hosts you did not see and punished the faithless
then after that allah will relent towards whomever he wills
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
o you who believe the idolaters are unclean so let them not approach the sacred mosque after this year
if you fear poverty allah will enrich you from his bounty if he wills
allah is allknowing allwise
fight those who do not believe in allah and the last day and do not forbid what allah has forbidden and his messenger and do not follow the way of those who have followed the truth until they pay the tribute out of their own hands and pay the
the jews say ezra is the son of allah and the christians say the messiah is the son of allah
that is their saying of their mouths they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before them
may allah assail them where are they being deluded
they have taken their rabbis and their monks as lords besides allah and their son of mary they were commanded to worship none but allah the messiah the son of mary the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary uzair ezra etc and they worship him and they were
they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah refuses to extinguish his light even though the disbelievers hate it
it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that he may uplift it above all religions even though the idolaters dislike it
o you who believe many of the rabbis and monks devour the goods of men and debar men from the way of allah
those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of allah announce to them a painful punishment
on the day when they will be heated in the fire of hell and their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with them and their sides and it will be said this is what you hoarded for yourselves
so taste now the punishment for what you used to hoard ”
indeed the number of months with allah is twelve months in the number of the heavens and the earth of allah is twelve lunar months
that is the right religion
so fight against them all together and know that they are with you and know that allah is with the godfearing
the postponement of sacred months is an increase in disbelief
they allow one to be lawful to another year and forbid what allah has made unlawful for him
the evil of their deeds seems pleasing to them and the sacred month and the offering are equal to it
allah does not guide the faithless lot
o you who believe what is amiss with you that when it is said to you march forth in the cause of allah you cling heavily to the earth
are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the hereafter
but the enjoyment of the life of this world compared with the hereafter is but meagre
if you do not march forth he will punish you with a painful punishment and replace you with a painful punishment and you will not hurt him at all
allah is able to do all things
if you do not help him god will help him
and when the faithless said to his companion “ do not grieve him when he was in the cave and said to his mother ‘ do not grieve him ’ he said ‘ ‘ do not be with the faithless ’
allah is allmighty allwise
march forth whether light or heavy and strive in the way of allah with your wealth and your lives in the cause of allah
that is better for you if you only knew
and if a near journey had been immediate or a journey they would have followed you but the distance seemed far to them
they will say if we had been able we would have gone out with you
they destroy their own souls and allah knows that they are lying
may allah forgive you
why did you grant them leave to stay behind before it was clear to you who were truthful
those who believe in allah and the last day ask you to be excused from striving with their wealth and their lives
allah is aware of the righteous
only those who ask leave of you who do not believe in allah and the last day and whose hearts are filled with doubt so they waver
had they intended to go forth they would have made it seem decorous to god but he held them back and said to them stay behind
had they gone forth with you they would have added to you nothing but to your difficulties and they would have hurried about to stir up sedition among you and some of you would have listened to you
allah is aware of the wrongdoers
they sought to stir up sedition before and upset you until the truth came to you and the decree of allah appeared though they were averse
and among them is he who says grant me leave to stay behind and know that they are already degraded
indeed hell encompasses the faithless
if good befalls you it vexes them but if a calamity befalls you they say we took our precautions and they turn away rejoicing in it
say nothing shall befall us except what allah has ordained
he is our maula lord helper
in allah let the believers put their trust
say are you expecting for us anything other than one of the two excellent things which allah promised you to us and for death while we await for you a punishment from him or at our hands
so wait we too are waiting with you
say spend willingly or unwillingly it will not be accepted from you for you are a people who are mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals etc
nothing prevents their expendings being accepted from being accepted from being accepted except that they do not believe in allah and his messenger and spend grudgingly
so let not their wealth nor their children please you allah only intends to punish them in this worldly life and that their souls may depart them from their souls
they swear by allah that they are of you but they are not of you
they are only a frightened lot
if they could find a refuge or caverns or a place to creep into they would turn straightway thereto
and among them are those who criticize you concerning the distribution of charities
if they are given thereof they are pleased but if they are not given thereof lo they are enraged
would that they were wellpleased with what allah and his messenger had given them and said allah is sufficient for us and allah will give us of his largesse
to allah we turn to him in prayer
the charities are only for the poor and the needy and the traveller and those who are needy and those who are needy and those who are needy and the traveller and the traveller and the traveller and the traveller are for the traveller
allah is allknowing allwise
and among them are those who hurt the prophet and say he is lending
say he listens to you and believes in god and trusts the faithful and believes in god and believes in god and believes he is a mercy for the believers
he is a mercy for those who believe
and those who insult god s messenger ’ will have a painful punishment
they swear to you by allah to please you but if they are believers they pleased and worthier to please him
do they not know that whoever opposes god and his messenger for him is the fire of hell where he will abide for ever
that is the great humiliation
the hypocrites fear lest a chapter should be revealed concerning them exposing what is in their hearts
say mock on god will bring about things you fear
if you ask them they will say we were only gossiping and jesting
say was it allah and his messenger and his messenger that you were mocking
make no excuse
you have disbelieved after your faith
if we forgive some of you we will punish others because they were guilty
the hypocrites both men and women are of one another
they enjoin what is evil and forbid what is right and tighten their hands from the way of allah
they forgot allah so he has forgotten them
the hypocrites are the transgressors
allah has promised the hypocrites men and women and the faithless the fire of hell where they will abide for ever
it is sufficient for them
allah has cursed them and for them is a lasting punishment
like those before you
they were more numerous than you in wealth and children
they enjoyed their share in the world and enjoyed their portion awhile as they enjoyed their share
you are like cattle in this world and in the hereafter and in the hereafter
it is they who are the losers
has there not come to them the news of those before them the people of noah and ad and thamud and the people of abraham the people of abraham and the overturned cities
their messengers came to them with clear signs
allah would not wrong them but they wronged themselves
the believing men and women are allies of one another
they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and pay zakah and obey allah and his messenger and allah is the most merciful of the merciful
allah is mighty wise
allah has promised the believing men and women gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein forever
therein they shall be abiders
that is the supreme success
o prophet strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh with them and their refuge is hell and what an evil destination
they swear by allah that they said nothing but
they had certainly said ‘ they have renounced faith and disbelieved after accepting islam and turned their faith after they had acquired and might accomplish what islam has been given to them
they purposed that they could not attain it except what allah had enriched them out of his grace
but if they repent it will be better for them and if they turn away then allah will punish them with a painful punishment
and they have no protector or helper
and among them are those who covenanted with allah saying if he gives us out of his bounty we will surely give alms and be of the righteous
but when he gave them of his bounty they became greedy and turned away averse
so he caused hypocrisy to remain hypocrisy to be in their hearts until the day they meet him because they broke their promise to him because they were promised allah
do they not know that allah knows their secret ideas and their najwa secret counsels and that allah is the knower of the unseen
those who criticize the believers who give alms and those who find nothing to give alms and those who find nothing to give them their endeavours and allah will scoff at them for them they will have a painful punishment
whether you ask forgiveness for them or not ask forgiveness for them even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times allah will not forgive them because they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and allah does not guide the transgressing lot
those who were left behind rejoiced at their staying behind the messenger of allah and disliked their wealth and their lives in the way of allah and said go not forth in the heat
say the fire of hell is more intense in heat if they but knew
so let them laugh a little and weep much as a reward for what they used to earn
if allah brings you back to a faction of them then they ask you to go out with the permission of a party of them say you will never go out with me nor will you fight with me against those who fight against you
you were wellpleased to sit back the first time so sit you back with those who stay behind
and never stand over any of them who dies nor stand thou over his grave
they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and died while they were sinners
and let not their possessions and their children depart in this life and that they should depart you thereby only punish them with it and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers
and whenever a sura is revealed enjoining revealed to you o muhammad saw ask your permission to sit with the messenger and leave those who sit behind by allah s leave and leave them to exempt them with their wealth and say leave us to stay behind
they are content to be with those who stay behind and their hearts are sealed so they understand not
but the messenger and those who believe with him struggled with their wealth and their lives and their lives are the successful
allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally
that is the supreme success
some of the bedouin arabs came to leave behind
but those who lied to allah and his messenger sat at home
a painful punishment will afflict those of them who disbelieve
there is no blame upon the weak nor on the sick nor on those who are sick nor on the road of allah and the messenger
there is no way against the gooddoers
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
nor shall they come to you with mounts when you came to them and said i find no mounts for you they turned away from you that you could find no mounts for the tribe of the beast of the mount when they turned back to spend away their
the blame is only against those who ask you to stay behind
allah has sealed up their hearts so they do not know
they will offer you excuses when you return to them
say make no excuse we will not believe you
allah has already informed us of the news concerning you
so allah will observe your conduct and his messenger and then you will be returned to him who knows the unseen and the visible and he will inform you of what you used to do
they will swear to you by allah when you return to them that you may leave them alone
so leave them alone
so leave them alone they are a worse punishment for what they used to earn
they will swear to you in order that you may be satisfied with them
but if you are wellpleased with them allah will not be pleased with the wrongdoing lot
the desertarabs are more unjust to the way of disbelief and hypocrisy and likeliest not the limits revealed to his messenger muhammad saw to the legal laws etc of disbelief
allah is allknowing allwise
and among the desertarabs are those who consider what they spend in the way of allah and wait for a reversal of fortune and wait for a reversal of fortune
theirs will be the evil turn of fortune
allah is hearer knower
and among the bedouins are some who believe in allah and the last day and regard what they spend in the way of allah and the last day
lo it is a means of nearness for them
allah will admit them to his mercy
allah is forgiving merciful
and the outstrippers of the migrants and those who followed the first of them and those who followed them in the way of allah and those who followed them in the way of allah and they are wellpleased with him
he has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow where they will abide forever
that is the supreme success
and among the bedouins are hypocrites and among the people of madinah who are hypocrites and also some are hypocrites
you do not know them but we know them
you know them not we know them but we know them
then they will be returned to a terrible punishment
and others have confessed their faults
perhaps allah will turn to them in forgiveness
allah is forgiving merciful
take sadaqah charity from their wealth and purify them and pray for them and pray for you your prayer is a source of tranquillity and allah is hearing knowing
do they not know that it is allah who accepts repentance from his servants and receives charities and that it is he who accepts repentance and who is the most merciful
say act then
allah will observe your deeds and the believers
you will be returned to him who knows the unseen and the visible and he will inform you of what you used to do
and others are deferred to allah s decree ’
allah will punish them for their punishment
allah is allknowing allwise
and as for those who have set up a mosque and blaspheming and blaspheming and as a mosque for hurting and blaspheming and as a cause for those who warred against allah and his messenger and his messenger and they warred against allah and his messenger and they warred
never stand there
a mosque founded upon piety from the first day is worthier that you stand in it
in it are men who love to purify themselves and allah loves the clean
is he who founds his building upon piety and his fear of allah and his good pleasure better or he who founds his building on the brink of a crumbling bank
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
the building which they built will never cease to be a cause of doubt in their hearts unless their hearts are torn in their hearts
allah is allknowing allwise
allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties and their lives in the way of allah they shall have paradise they shall have neither killed nor bond
who is truer in statement than allah
who fulfilleth his covenant better than allah
that is the supreme success
those who repent are those who worship allah and those who kneel those who kneel and prostrate themselves and forbid what is right and forbid what is wrong and forbid what is right and forbid what is wrong
and give glad tidings to the believers
it is not for the prophet and those who believe to ask forgiveness for the polytheists even if they are near relatives after it has become clear to them that they are the people of hell
and abraham s pleading forgiveness for his father was only a promise he had made to him
but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of allah he repudiated him
abraham was kind and clement
allah does not guide a people after he has guided them until he makes clear to them what they should guard against
indeed allah is knowing of all things
indeed to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he it is who gives life and causes death
and besides allah you have neither a wali protector nor any helper
allah has turned clemently to the prophet and the emigrants and the helpers who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a part of the prophet saw and the ansar had wellnigh swerved aside it is likely that he may accept them
indeed he is the gentle the merciful the most merciful
and also for three days who were left behind
when the earth is shaken with its expanse and their own souls became narrow for them there is no refuge from allah
then he turned to them in mercy so that they might repent
allah is the relenting the merciful
o you who believe fear allah and stand with the truthful
it is not fitting for the people of madinah and the bedouins around them to hang the messenger of allah and to stay behind the messenger of allah and to repel the pain of the enemy from their lives and they are not a resident of the disbelievers nor
indeed allah does not allow the reward of the virtuous
nor do they spend anything of their spending nor do they cross a valley but it is written in their account that allah may reward them according to the best of what they used to do
and it is not for the believers to march out altogether
if a group of every section of them expelled from the sea behind that they may go forth to the common people who are common people when they return to them that they may beware
o you who believe fight those adjacent to you and let them find severity in you and know that allah is with the cautious
whenever a chapter is sent down to you some of them say ‘ what has it increased in faith ’
as for those who believe it has increased them in faith and they rejoice
but as for those in whose hearts is disease it has increased them in a pollution and they die while they are disbelievers
do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice they do not repent nor do they remember
and whenever a surah is sent down they look at one another saying is anybody observing you
allah has turned away their hearts for they are a people who do not understand
o messenger muhammad saw
there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves grievous to him is he who has excused you for you and is full of kindness and kind and merciful to the believers
but if they turn away say allah is sufficient for me
there is no god except he
in him i have put my trust and he is the lord of the mighty throne
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the wise book
is it a wonder to the people that we revealed to a man from among them saying warn mankind of the good news that they may warn mankind and give the good news to the believers that they may have a clear sorcerer
indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days then established himself on the throne directing all affairs
there is no intercessor except after his permission
that is allah your lord
worship him
will you not remember
to him is the return of you all together
it is he who originates creation then brings it back again and will recompense those who believe and do righteous deeds
as for those who disbelieve for them awaits a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what they used to defy
it is he who made the sun a radiance and the moon a light and determined it phases that you may know the number of years and the calculation of years
allah did not create them except with truth
he detaileth the revelations for a people who know
in the alternation of the night and day and in all that allah has created in the heavens and the earth are indeed signs for people who are pious
indeed those who hope not for meeting with us and are satisfied with the life of this world and satisfied with it and those who are heedless of our signs
their refuge shall be the fire for what they used to earn
those who believe and do good deeds their lord will guide them by their faith and will guide them in gardens of delight
their prayer will be glory be to you therein and their greeting therein will be peace ‘ ‘ peace ’ and their greetings of worship ‘ ‘ ‘ ’ ’ and their greetings ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’
were allah to hasten the evil for men to hasten the evil their term would have been made to hasten the good their term would have been ended by their own hands
so we leave those who do not expect to meet us to wander blindly on in their contumacy
and when adversity touches man he calls upon us lying on his side or sitting or standing but when we remove his affliction from him he passes on as if he had never called us a loss
thus do they recommend the transgressors that they have been doing
and how many generations have we destroyed before you when they did wrong their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they were not believers
thus do we requite the sinful people
then we appointed you leaders after them in the earth so that you may see how you would act
and when our clear revelations are recited to them those who hope not to meet us say bring a qur an other than this or change it
say it is not for me to change it of my accord
i only follow what is revealed to me
indeed i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day ’
say “ had allah willed i would not have recited it to you nor would he have made it known to you
i have lived among you a lifetime before it
will you then not understand
who is more wicked than he who invents a lie about allah or belies his verses
the sinners will not prosper
they worship besides allah that which can neither benefit them nor harm them and they say these are our intercessors with allah
say do you inform allah of something he does not know in the heavens or on the earth
glory be to him high be he exalted above what they associate
mankind were but one nation so they differed
then they will come to pass into another state
and had it not been for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been settled between them concerning that wherein they differ
and they say why has not a sign been sent down to him from his lord
say “ the unseen belongs only to god so wait for god s
i am waiting with you
and when we let mankind taste mercy after some adversity has touched them behold they scheme against our signs
say allah is swifter in strategy
our envoys write down what you scheme
it is he who carries you across land and sea
and when you sail at the ships and sail with a favourable wind and they sail in the sea with a favourable wind and they sail with a favourable breeze and when you are travelling in ships they sail with a favourable wind they are in it and they
but when he delivereth them behold they commit violations on earth wrongfully
your violations are only against yourselves as the enjoyment of the present life
then to us is your return and we will inform you of what you used to do
the likeness of the life of this world is as water which we send down from the sky and the earth mingles with it and cattle eat
and when the earth is embellished and adorned with its golden raiment and its tillers and its tillers they come upon it as if it had come to pass by night or day we bring it as if it had not flourished in front of them
thus do we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for people who reflect
allah invites to the abode of peace and guides whomever he wills to a straight path
for those who do good is the best reward and a surplus
neither dust nor abasement shall overspread their faces
such are rightful owners of the garden they will abide therein
as for those who have earned evil deeds the recompense of an evil deed is its like and humiliation will cover them
they will have no saviors against allah
their faces are covered with dark patches of night
they are the residents of hell and are there they will abide
and on the day when we gather them all together then we will say to those who associated others with allah in his divinity “ travel in your place and your partners in worship ” and then they will say “ it was not us who used to worship
allah is sufficient as a witness between us and you we were not aware of your worship
there every soul shall know what it has earned and they shall be returned to allah their rightful lord the true master and they shall be returned to all that they used to fabricate
say who provides for you from the sky and the earth and who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living and who directs the affair they will say then do you not fear allah
such is allah your lord the true
so what is there after truth except error
so where are you being led away
thus the word of your lord is realized against those who disobey the word of your lord so that they will not believe
say is there any of your partners who begins creation and then repeats it
say allah originates creation then reverts it
so where are you being led away
say is there any among your partners who guides to the truth
say allah guides to the truth
is he who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who is more guided than he who guides to the truth
what is the matter with you how do you judge ’
most of them follow nothing but illusion and illusion can not replace the truth
allah is aware of what they do
this quran could not have been fabricated by any other than allah
but it is a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed exposition of the book
there is no doubt about it
or do they say he has forged it
say bring down upon it a surah chapter like it and call upon whomever you can besides allah if you are truthful
nay they have denied that which they comprehended not and that which they comprehended not and that whereof they have not yet comprehended
those who were before them denied
so see how was the end of the wrongdoers
some of them believe in it and some do not believe in it
your lord knows best those who do corruption
and if they deny you say “ my deeds are for me and for you are your deeds ”
you are quit of what i do and i am quit of what you do
and among them are those who listen to you but can you make the deaf hear even though they apprehend not
and among them are some who look to you so can you guide the blind even though they see not
indeed allah does not wrong mankind in the least but they wrong themselves
on the day when he will gather them all together it will be as if they had stayed in this world but a day they will recognize one day
those who denied the meeting with allah will be losers
they were not guided
whether we show you some of what we promise them or we call you to us to return
allah is witness to all that they do
and for every nation there is a messenger
when their messenger comes justly the matter is decided between them equitably and they do not wrong themselves
and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if you are truthful
say i have no power to benefit or hurt except what allah wills
for every nation is a term appointed
when their time comes they will not delay it nor will they precede it
say have you considered if his punishment should come to you by night or by day
why are the culprits seeking to hasten it
and when it overtakes you will now believe it when you have now warned it at its death while you will believe in it
then it will be said to the wrongdoers taste the chastisement of eternity
shall you be rewarded except according to what you used to earn ’
and they ask you o muhammad saw to inform them is it true
say yes by my lord
it is you who will not cause failure to him
and if every soul owned everything on earth it would offer it to ransom himself from the punishment of the day of resurrection it would offer it
and they will judge between them with justice and they will not be wronged
the <unk> will be paid in full for them and they will not be wronged
unquestionably to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth but most of them do not know
he it is who gives life and causes death
to him is the return
o mankind there has come to you an exhortation from your lord and a healing for what is in the breasts of the chests and a guidance and mercy for believers
say in the bounty of allah and his mercy let them rejoice it is better than what they amass
say have you considered what god has sent down for you of the earth and some of it you have made unlawful
say “ did allah give you permission or do you fabricate lies against allah ”
what think they who invent lies against allah and will be made to think of the day of resurrection
allah is bountiful to mankind but most of them do not give thanks
you do not recite any matter nor do you recite any of the qur an nor do you work any deed in it but we are witnesses over you
and nothing is hidden from your lord in the earth or in the heaven or in the earth but is greater than that or greater than that or greater than that or in a clear book
unquestionably the friends of allah is neither fear nor regret
those who believe and are godfearing
for them is good news in this world and in the hereafter
there is no altering the words of allah
that is the supreme success
and let not their speech grieve you
indeed all honour belongs to allah and he is the allhearer the allknower
lo verily unto allah belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth
those who call upon other than allah follow their partners
they follow only conjectures and they do not perceive
it is he who made the night for you to rest and the day to see
verily in that are signs for a people who listen
they say allah has taken a son
glory be to him
his is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
you have no authority over this
do you attribute to allah what you do not know
say verily those who invent lies against allah will not prosper
they will have to us in this world then to us will return then we will make them taste a severe punishment for their disbelief
and when he said to his people “ o my people if my stay with you is firm of god i have put my trust in god so put my trust in god
so resolve on your plan and call upon your plan
so do not give me respite till you have designated for me
but if you turn away i have asked of you no wage for it i have been commanded to be of those who submit to allah and i am commanded to be of those who submit to allah
but they denied him
so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and we made them successors and we drowned those who had made the successors of the earth
and then they were denied our signs
so see what was the end of those who were warned
then after him we sent messengers to their people and they brought them clear proofs
but they were not to believe in what they had denied before
thus do we seal the hearts of the transgressors
then after them we sent moses and aaron with our signs to pharaoh and his council
but they were arrogant and were a sinful people
so when the truth came to them from us they said “ this is magic ”
moses said what do you say of the truth when it has come to you
is this magic and the magicians fare not well
they said have you come to us to turn us away from that which we found our fathers following and that the domination in the land you two
we will not believe you
pharaoh said bring me every expert sorcerer
so when the magicians came moses said to them cast down what you will cast
and when they had cast moses said what you have brought is magic
allah does not foster efforts of those who cause corruption
and allah will vindicate the truth by his words even though the sinners detest it
so none believed in moses except a few of his people from pharaoh and his people for they were nonetheless afraid
he was a tyrant
moses said o my people if you believe in allah then put your trust in him if you are muslims
they said “ in god we have put our trust
our lord make us not a trial for the wrongdoing people
and deliver us by your mercy from the faithless lot ’
and we inspired moses and his brother saying take your houses in egypt and make your houses a place of worship to your people and perform the prayer and give glad tidings to the believers
moses said our lord let thou live in this life and his establishment of the world and riches and harden thy life and harden their adornment and harden their hearts that they may not believe in the life of the world until they see the torment afflictive
he said your supplication has been answered
so keep steadfast and do not follow the path of those who do not know
and we delivered the children of israel across the sea
pharaoh and his troops pursued them
so pharaoh followed his nation until when he said ‘ i believe in him ’ and i am one of the children of israel ’
now now you believe whereas you were disobedient to allah and were one of the mischiefmakers
so today we will save you from your body so that you may be a sign for those who are certain of our signs
and we settled the children of israel in a settlement and provided them with good things
they did not differ until knowledge came to them
your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning their differences
and if you are in doubt about what we have sent down to you then ask those who read the book before you
the truth has come to you from your lord
so be not of those who doubt it
and be not of those who deny the signs of allah or you will be among the losers
those against whom the word of your lord is realized will not believe
even though every sign comes to them until they see the painful punishment
why was there not a town that believed and profited its faith until when its faith came to them except the people of jonah
when they believed we removed from them the punishment of disgrace in worldly life and we provided them for a while
and if your lord had willed all those who are on earth would have believed all of them
wouldst thou then constrain people until they become believers
no soul can believe except by the permission of allah
he puts no sense to those who do not understand
say observe what is in the heavens and the earth
but neither signs nor warnings avail a people who do not believe
do they watch for anything except the days of those who passed away before them
say wait i too am waiting with you
then we save our messengers and the believers who believe in the oneness of allah and his messenger muhammad saw and the believers who will save us from our torment
say o people if you are in doubt about my religion then know that i worship none but god who will gather you to die and i am commanded to be of the believers
and set your face toward the religion and be not of those who associate others with allah
and invoke not beside allah that which can neither hurt you nor hurt you and if you should be one of the wrongdoers
and if allah touches you with harm none can remove it except he and if he wills none can repel his protection
and if allah desires to grant you some good and he who has given you his bounty
he causes it to reach whom he wills of his servants
he is the forgiving the merciful
say o mankind
whosoever is guided is guided only for his own soul and whosoever goes astray it is for his own loss
i am not a guardian over you
follow what is revealed to you and be patient until allah issues his judgement and he is the best of judges
alif lam ra
this is a book whose verses are perfected and then elaborated from one who is allwise allaware
that you worship none but allah
i am unto you from him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings
and ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him
he will grant you enjoyment for a while he will grant you a good provision and will bestow his grace upon every possessor of bounty
but if you turn away i fear for you the chastisement of a mighty day
to allah you will be returned
he is able to do all things
unquestionably they fold up their breasts that they may hide from him
indeed when they cover themselves with their garments he knows what they hide and what they reveal
he is aware of what is in the breasts of men
there is no animal on the earth but its sustenance he knows its dwelling and its repository
all is in a manifest book
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and his throne was upon the waters that he might test you in which of you is best in conduct
and if you say you will surely be raised up after death those who disbelieve will say this is nothing but obvious magic
and if we defer the punishment until a reckoned time they will say what holds it back
unquestionably on the day when it comes upon them it will not be averted from them and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule
and if we let a taste of mercy from us and then withdraw it from him he becomes despondent ungrateful
and if we let him taste favour after hardship has touched him he says “ ills have departed from me ” he becomes excited and boastful
except those who are patient and do good deeds
for them is forgiveness and a great reward
so leave thou aside some of what is revealed unto thee forsake that which is revealed unto thee and that thou mayst not say a treasure hath been revealed unto him or an angel was revealed with him
you are only a warner
and allah is disposer of all things
or do they say he has invented it
say then bring ten surahs like it and call upon whomever you can besides allah if you are truthful
but if they do not answer you know that it has been revealed to you that it is revealed with the knowledge of allah
will you then submit
and whosoever desireth the life of this world and its glitter and its recompense we repay them in full for their works therein and they will not be defrauded
these are the ones for whom there is nothing in the hereafter except the fire
their works are annulled and what they used to do
is he who stands on a clear proof from his lord and before him a witness from him and before him is a guide and a mercy
and those who believe in it believe in it
so whoever defies it from among the various factions the fire is the promised destination
so be not in doubt about it
it is the truth from your lord but most people do not believe
who is more wicked than he who invents a lie about allah
such will be presented before their lord and the witnesses will say these are they who lied concerning their lord
lo the curse of allah is upon the wrongdoers
who bar others from the way of allah and seek to make it crooked and disbelieve in the hereafter
they will not be able to frustrate allah on the earth nor will they be able to defend them from allah
they were unable to hear nor could they see
they are the ones who have ruined their souls and what they used to fabricate has forsaken them
they will be unnecessarily the greatest losers in the hereafter
those who believe and do good deeds and humble themselves before their lord they are the inhabitants of paradise they will abide therein eternally
the likeness of the two parties is as the blind and deaf and the seeing and the seeing and the hearing and the seeing and the seeing are equal
will you not remember
and assuredly we sent nuh unto his folk saying verily i am unto you a warner manifest
worship none but allah
i fear for you the chastisement of a painful day ”
the notables among his people who disbelieved said we see you but a human being like ourselves and we do not see you in any other following except a man who is following behind you and they do not perceive that we follow you except a following and they
we see not in you a merit over us rather we think you are liars
he said o my people bethink you if i rested upon a clear proof from my lord and he has given me mercy from him and his evil deeds obscure that you are averse to it
my people i do not ask you for it any wealth
my reward lies only with allah
i will not drive away those who believe they will not meet their lord
but i see that you are a people behaving ignorantly
o my people who would help me against allah if i drive them away
will you not remember
i say not unto you that i possess the treasures of allah nor do i say the unseen nor do i say to the unseen
i do not say to those who are despicable or that i do not say to those whom you possess something that allah will not bestow any good upon them
allah knows what is in their hearts and if i should be of the wrongdoers
they said o noah you have disputed with us and you have disputed with us
then bring us what you threaten us with if you are truthful
he said “ allah will bring it upon you if he wills and you will not escape for it ”
my exhorting will not profit you if i want to counsel you aright
he is your lord and to him you will be returned
or do they say he has forged it
say if i have invented it upon me falls my guilt
i am innocent of what you do
and it was revealed to noah saying noone of your people will believe except those who have believed already before their hands
so do not grieve for what they do
build the ark under our eyes and by our inspiration and by our inspiration and do not plead for they will be drowned
and he was building the ark whenever the elders of his people passed by him they ridiculed him
he said if you laugh at us we will laugh at you as you laugh at us
you will come to know who will come to know who will be overtaken by a humiliating punishment
until when our command came and the oven boiled we said embark therein two of every kind of animal and thy family except those of whom the word has been passed and the word has already gone forth except for those who believe
and none believed with him except a few
he said embark therein
in the name of allah is its sailing and its anchorage
my lord is forgiving merciful
and it sailed with them amid waves like mountains and noah called out to his son who was standing aloof my son
embark with us and be with the disbelievers ”
he said i will betake me to a mountain that will protect me from the water
he said “ there is no protection from god s decree ’ except for him on whom he has mercy ”
and the waves came between them and he was among the drowned
and it was said o earth swallow your water
swallow up your water and o sky
and the water was fulfilled and the decree of allah was fulfilled
and it was said unto the people of the mount aljudi and it was said away with the wrongdoing folk
and noah called to his lord saying my lord my son is of my family and your family is one of the truthful
and if you are of the judges you are the best of judges
he said o noah
he is indeed unrighteous conduct
and do not ask me about what you have no knowledge
i admonish you lest you become one of the ignorant
he said my lord i seek refuge in thee lest i should ask me a thing which i have no knowledge of my lord if thou forgivest me not and me not and i shall be among the losers
it was said o noah
disembark with peace from us and blessings upon you and upon nations from us
and there will be other communities of old but a trial from us and then a painful punishment will befall them
these are accounts of the unseen which we reveal to you
you did not know them nor did you guide them
o messenger
and be patient indeed the best outcome is for the cautious
and to ad their brother hood he said o my people worship allah you have no god but he you are but fabricators
o my people i ask of you no wage for it my wage is with you
my reward is due from him who created me
will you not understand
and o my people ask forgiveness of your lord and repent to him
he will loose the sky upon you from the sky and will add strength to your strength
so do not turn away from him who was guilty
they said o hud you have not brought us a clear sign
we are not going to abandon our gods for what you say
we only say “ some of our gods have afflicted you with madness ”
he said i call god to witness and witness that i am quit of what you associate
apart from him
so conspire against me and give me no respite
i have put my trust in god my lord and your lord there is no creature that crawls on the earth except he who holds it by the forelock and my lord is straight
but if you turn away i have conveyed to you what i was sent to you
my lord will make people succeed you and you will not harm him at all
my lord is guardian over all things
and when our command came we saved hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and we saved them from a harsh punishment
and that was aad they disbelieved in the signs of their lord and rebelled against his messengers and followed the bidding of every froward tyrant
so they were pursued by a curse in this world and on the day of resurrection
lo
the people of hood will be averse to their lord
and to thamood we sent their brother salih
he said o my people worship allah you have no god other than him
he made you dwell in the earth and made you live
and ask forgiveness of him and repent to him surely my lord is near responsive
they said o salih you have been one of us as a hoped for us
do you forbid us to worship what our forefathers worshipped
indeed we are in grave doubt concerning what you invite us to
he said o my people
bethink you if i have a clear proof from my lord and he has given me mercy from him who will protect me from the punishment of allah
you will increase me in nothing but loss
o my people this is the shecamel of god a sign for you
so leave her alone to graze on god s earth and do not molest her lest you should trample a painful punishment
but they hamstrung her and he said enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days
this is a promise that is infallible
so when our command came we saved salih and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and from the disgrace of that day
indeed your lord is the allstrong the allmighty
and the wrongdoers seized the scream and morning found them in their homes
as if they had never lived there
lo thamud disbelieved in their lord
lo thamud disbelieved in the end
and indeed our messengers came to abraham with good news they said peace
he said peace and delayed not but he brought a roasted calf
but when he saw their hands not reaching to it he mistrusted them and conceived a fear of them
they said fear not we have been sent to the people of lot
and his wife was standing before him and we gave her the glad tidings of the birth of isaac and after isaac and jacob
she said woe unto me
shall i bear a child when i am an old woman and this my husband is an old man
this is indeed a strange thing
they said do you wonder at the decree of allah
the mercy of allah and his blessings be upon you o people of the house
indeed he is alllaudable allglorious ’
so when the awe departed from abraham and the good news reached him he pleaded with us concerning the people of lot
abraham was kind and penitent
o abraham forsake abraham
desist from this and your lord s command ’ has come and a punishment will not come upon them
and when our messengers came to lot he was troubled and distressed for them and felt straitened for them and said this is a dreadful day
and his people came rushing towards him and they were doing evil deeds
he said o my people these are my daughters they are purer for you
so fear allah and degrade me not in the guests of my guests
is there not one man among you a righteous man
they said you know well that we have no right to your daughters and indeed you know what we want
he said would that i had strength to overpower you or could take refuge in a strong pillar
they said o lot we are messengers of your lord
they will not touch you
and your wife at night and yourself will be with your wife
so travel with your family during the night and let them go around you
their tryst is the morning
is not the morning near
so when our command came we turned the city upside down and rained upon it stones of baked clay
marked with your lord
nor is it the evildoers far off
and to madyan we sent their brother shu aib he said o my people worship allah and do not create a god for you there is no god but i fear for you the punishment of the day of resurrection
o my people
give full measure and full weight in justice and do not cheat the people and do not spread corruption on the earth
that which remains of allah is better for you if you are believers
and i am not a guardian over you
they said shu aib commandeth thee that we should forsake thy gods as we commanded thee that which our fathers worshipped or that we should leave with our goods
you are the clement the rightminded
bethink you if i rested upon a clear proof from my lord and he has provided me with good things
i desire not to counsel you from my lord
i only desire to act as far as i can
my success lies only with allah
in him i trust and to him i turn
o my people let not your opposition against me occasion that you may bring upon the people of noah or the people of hud or the people of salih saleh and the people of salih saleh
and the people of lot are not far away from you
ask forgiveness of your lord and turn to him in repentance
my lord is merciful loving
they said o shu aib we do not understand much of what you say and we see you are weak among us
we see you weak among us if it were not for your tribe we would have stoned you and you would have stoned you for your wife for you are not a formidable challenge
he said o my people is my tribe stronger in you than allah
my lord comprehends whatever you do
o my people work according to your station
i will soon come to know who will come to know who will come a punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar
so watch i am waiting with you ”
and when our command came we saved shu aib and those who believed with him by mercy from us
and the shout overtook those who wronged themselves and they lay lifeless prostrate in their homes
as if they had never lived there
lo away with madyan like the people of midian even as thamud were removed afar
and we sent moses with our signs and a manifest authority
to pharaoh and his council but they followed the command of pharaoh and pharaoh was not rightminded
he will go ahead of his people on the day of resurrection and lead them into the fire how evil is the wateringplace to be led
they were pursued by a curse in this world and on the day of resurrection
evil is the gift that will be given them
these are some of whose accounts we recount to you
some have been standing and some have withered away
we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
and their gods whom they invoked besides allah availed them not when they invoked besides allah s command ’ and they added to their destruction
such is the grip of your lord when he seizes the towns in the midst of their evildoing
indeed his seizing is painful and severe
indeed in that is a sign for him who fears the punishment of the hereafter that is a day when all mankind is gathered and that is a day when all that is a day that is a day when mankind will be gathered
and we do not postpone it except for a limited term
on the day when it comes no one will speak except by his permission
some will be wretched and others happy
as for those who are illfated will be wretched and in the fire they will have therein sighing and wailing
they will abide therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure except as your lord wills
verily your lord is doer of what he wills
and as for those who are blessed they will be in paradise abiding therein forever and your lord s command ’ is the residence of the heavens and the earth as long as the heavens and the earth remain as your lord wills
so be not thou in doubt concerning what these worship
they worship only as their fathers worshipped before
we will pay them in full their undiminished
and we gave moses the book but there passed away
had it not been for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been settled between them
they are in serious doubt about it
and your lord will repay fully aware of what they do
so wait thou as you are commanded
those who repent to you and those who have believed and followed you and were guided
he is seeing of what you do
and incline not toward those who do wrong lest the fire should touch you
you have no protectors besides allah and you will not be helped
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and are at the two ends of the day and in the watches of the night
good deeds drive away the bad deeds
that is a reminder for those who heed advice
and be patient indeed allah does not waste the reward of the virtuous
if only there had been among the generations before you men endued with wisdom restraining the earth except a few of those whom we saved from among them
but those who did wrong followed them and became guilty
your lord would never destroy the cities unjustly while their people were rightdoers
had your lord willed he would have made mankind one community
but they will not cease to be divided in their differences
except those on whom your lord shows mercy
and it is that your lord has created them for that which he has created them and that they may be the dwellers of the world and the earth pass over all mankind
so i will say to the angels “ i will fill hell with jinn and men ”
and all that we relate to you of the messengers of the messengers is in order that we may strengthen your heart thereby
and in the truth has come to you and a reminder for the believers
and say to those who do not believe act according to your power lo we are working
and wait we too are waiting
to allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth and to him all matters are returned
so worship him and put your trust in him
your lord is not unaware of what you do
alif lam ra
ra these are the verses of the clear book
we have sent it down as an arabic koran so that you may understand
we narrate to you the best of narratives in this quran that you were before it and you were among the unaware
remember when joseph said to his father o my father i saw eleven planets and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating themselves before me
he said o my son do not recount your vision to your brothers for they are an enemy to you satan verily satan is to you a manifest enemy
thus thy lord will choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of discourses and upon thee and upon the house of jacob and upon the house of jacob as he perfected it upon thee and upon the house of jacob and upon the house of jacob
your lord is allknowing allwise
in joseph and his brethren there are signs for those who inquire
when they said joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are many though we are a band greater than killing
our father is in manifest error ’
kill joseph or cast him into some distant land so that you may be left alone
afterwards we shall turn to him in repentance after this
one of them said ‘ do not kill joseph but cast him into the bottom of the well and cast him into a well that will tumble into the bottom of the pit of some fire ’
they said father why should you not trust us with joseph when we are his wellwishers
send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play
we will take care of him ”
he said “ it grieves me that you should take him away while you are afraid of him when you are unaware of him ”
they said if the wolf should devour him while we are a band then we would surely be of the losers
so when they took him away with him they agreed to put him into a well
we inspired him saying thou shalt not tell them of this deed they will surely bear witness against it
and they came to their father in the evening weeping
they said o our father we went racing and left joseph behind us
but you will not believe us even though we are truthful ”
and they brought his shirt stained with false blood
he said nay but your spirits tempted you to do somewhat
and i am only granting me sweet patience and i am for allah only help
and there came a caravan and they sent their waterdrawer
he said ‘ this is a boy ’
and they hid him as merchandise
allah was aware of what they did
and they sold him for a cheap price a few dirhams for they were <unk>
and the egyptian of egypt said to his wife make him a son whose household may be done to us he said to us stay in order that he may be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son
so we established joseph in the land and taught him the interpretation of events
allah prevails in his affairs but most people do not know
and when he reached his maturity we bestowed upon him judgment and knowledge
thus do we reward the doers of good
and she in whose house he was sought to seduce him
she closed the doors and said ‘ i seek your protection ’
he said “ my lord has made me a good abode ”
indeed the wrongdoers do not prosper ’
she desired him and he would have desired her if he had not seen the proof of his lord
thus it was that we might avert from him evil and indecency
he was one of our chosen servants
and they raced to the door and she tore his shirt from behind
they encountered her master at the door
she said what is the recompense of your wife who wisheth evil for your wife except imprisonment or a painful punishment
joseph said it was she who sought to seduce me
a witness from her household suggested testified if his shirt is torn from the front then she speaketh truth and he is of the liars
but if his shirt is torn from behind then she has lied and he is one of the truthful
so when he saw his shirt torn from behind he said “ this is of your women indeed the deception of women is great ”
joseph ignore this and you o woman
and women in the city said the wife of al azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy
we see her in clear error
and when she heard of their sly talk she sent against them and prepared for them a cushioned couch and gave each of them a knife
she said “ come out before them ”
so when they saw him they cut off their hands and said ‘ allah has got the right hands of the hidden ’
this is not a noble angel
she said “ this is he in whose hand is the interpretation of dreams ”
but i sought to seduce him but he refused
he said “ if i do not do what i command him he will be imprisoned and be one of the humiliated ”
he said my lord prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me
unless you do not avert from me their guile i will incline towards them and become one of the ignorant ”
so his lord answered him and turned away from him their plan verily he is the hearer the knower
then it seemed to them after they had seen the signs of his innocence to imprison him for a while
and two young men went to prison with him
one of them said i dreamed that i was pressing wine
the other said i dreamed that i am carrying bread on my head bread whereof the birds were eating
tell us its interpretation for we see you are one of the righteous ”
he said no food shall come to you ere the meals which you have come to you shall come to you in wakefulness it before it comes to you
this knowledge is of what my lord has taught me
i have forsaken the tradition of people who do not believe in allah and in the hereafter
and i have followed the religion of my fathers abraham isaac and jacob
it does not behoove us to associate anything with allah
this is the grace of allah unto us and unto mankind but most people do not give thanks
o my fellowprisoners have lords better or allah the one the irresistible
you worship besides him are not but names which you and your fathers have named you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority
judgment belongs to allah
judgment belongs to allah alone
he has commanded that you worship none but him
that is the right religion but most people do not know
fellowprisoners as for one of you he will pour wine for his master wine and the other will peck at his head
the matter about which you inquired inquire has been decided
and he said to his lord “ be saved me from the two mention me ”
but satan caused him to forget mentioning him to his master so he remained in prison for several years
and the king said i saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean ones devouring them and seven green ears of corn and seven withered
o elders explain to me my vision if you can interpret dreams
they said “ these are confused dreams ”
then the one who had been released remembered after the one of the two days then said i will inform you of its interpretation so send me forth
he said o council
o truthful one
explain to me the seven fat kine which seven lean cows are devouring and the seven green ears of corn and seven others dry so that they may return to the world
he said you will sow seven years for seven years which you reap and its spikes except a little which you eat
then after that there will come seven hard years which will consume whatever you have stored for them except a little which you will preserve
then after that a year which people will come to pass and in which the people will press grapes and in which they will press
the king said bring him to me
and when the messenger came to him he said return to your lord and ask him what was the case of the women who cut their hands
my lord is the knower of their guile
the king said what was your business women when you solicited joseph
they said allah forbid
we know no evil of him
the chief s wife said now the truth has come out
it was i who sought to seduce him
he is indeed truthful ’
he said “ i did this plan so that i may know that i did not betray him in the footsteps of allah and that i do not betray the plan of betrayers ”
i do not claim that my lord has mercy to me except as one who has mercy
my lord is forgiving merciful
the king said bring him to me i will attach him to my person
then when he spoke to him he said “ today you are established in our ranks ”
he said set me over the land i am a knowledgeable keeper
thus we established joseph in the land to live wherever he liked
we bestow favour out of our mercy whomever we will and we do not waste the wage of the gooddoers
and the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and are godfearing
and joseph s brothers came and entered into egypt and he was joseph s ’ confederates
he recognized them but they did not know him
and when he had furnished them with their furnishing he said bring me a brother of yours from your father
do you not see that i give full measure and that i am the best of hosts
but if you do not bring him to me you will have no measure from me nor will you approach me ”
they said we will surely entice him from his father and we will surely do it
he said to his servants put their goods in their saddlebags so that they may recognize it when they return to their families they will recognize it
so when they returned to their father they said father is further astray
so send our brother with us that we may bring supplies
and we shall take care of our brother so send him with us a measure from us
he said “ shall i trust you with his brother before i give you his brother as i trusted you with his trust
but allah is the best of guardians and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy
and when they opened their baggage they found that their goods had been returned to them
they said o our father
what more can we desire
we will get provisions for our family and we will guard our brother and guard our brother s load ’ s load ’
he said i will not send him with you until you bring me a solemn pledge from you unless you are surrounded by allah that you will bring him back to me unless you are surrounded
when they had given him their assurance he said allah is witness over what we say
and he said o my sons enter not by one gate but enter by separate gates
i can not avail you against god
judgment belongs to allah alone
in him i have put my trust
in him let all the trusting put their trust ’
and when they entered upon their father the covenant of allah did not avail them anything against it it was only the help of allah
he said ‘ indeed he was a need of jacob
but he had knowledge of the people given knowledge owing to the knowledge of the people but most people do not know
and when they presented themselves before joseph he said to his brother “ i am your brother ”
i am not a <unk> of what they used to do
then when he had furnished them with their furnishing he put his drinkingcup in his brother s bag ’
you are thieves
they turned towards them and said what is it you have lost
they said we miss the king s cup and he who brings it out for him a camelload and a camel s load
he said i am able to say
they said by allah you know that we did not come to cause corruption in the land and we are not thieves
they said what shall be the recompense for him if you are lying
they said the penalty in that he shall be its recompense for he who is the recompense of his punishment
thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
then he began with their bags before his brother s bag ’ s bag ’ s bag ’
so we made joseph s wife ’ for joseph s wife ’ so wished to be freed of his brother
he could not have taken his brother away except for whom he wills
we raise whomever we will over all things knowing
they said if he stealeth a brother of his stole before
but joseph kept it secret in his soul and said to them you are an evil thing
he said “ you are in a worse situation and allah knows best what you allege ”
they said “ o governor ”
we see you are one of us
he said “ god forbid
except him who is more suitable and forbid him to save him
if we should do so we would be harmdoers
when they despaired of him they went away in private consultation
the eldest of them said do you not know that your father has taken a solemn pledge from you before you failed in allah and that you failed in the case of joseph
so i will not leave this land until my father permits me or allah passes away from me and he is the best of judges
return to your father and say “ o our father your son has stolen and we testify only to what we did not know ”
ask the people of the city where we were and the caravan in which we travelled
we are truthful ”
he said nay but your ownselves have beguiled you so that your souls may be well aware of what allah has ordained for me is the best knower
and he turned away from them and said alas for joseph
and his eyes turned white with sorrow and he became depressed
they said by allah you will not cease remembering joseph until you wreck yourself
he said “ i complain of my anguish and my grief to allah i know from allah and what you do not know ”
my sons go about joseph and his brother and despair not of allah s comfort and despair of the comfort of allah s comfort lo
then when they entered into his presence they said o ruler of the land
we have brought but merchandise of hardship so give us full measure and be charitable to us and give us full measure and weight and be charitable to us
allah rewards the charitable
he said ‘ do you know what you did ’
they said are you really joseph
he said ‘ i am joseph and this is my brother
allah has been gracious to us
and whosoever fears allah and is patient verily allah wasteth not the hire of the welldoers
they said by allah verily allah hath preferred thee above us and we have been sinners
he said no reproach on you today allah will forgive you and he is the most merciful of the merciful
go take this shirt of mine and cast it over my father s face he will recover his sight
and bring me your whole family with me ”
and when the caravan departed their father said i smell the scent of joseph if you think i am senile ”
they said by allah you are still persisting in your old error
so when the bearer of glad tidings arrived he cast it over his face and he regained his sight he said did i not tell you that i know from allah what you do not know
they said our father ask forgiveness for us for we were indeed sinners
he said i will ask forgiveness for you from my lord he is the forgiving the merciful
then when they entered into his presence he said enter egypt in security and secure
and he raised his parents on the throne and they fell down prostrate before him
he said father ‘ my father is gracious to me
my lord has made it come true
he was gracious to me when he took me out of the prison after satan had made strife between you and me and my brothers for my brothers and my brothers
he is the knower the wise
my lord
originator of the heavens and earth
you are my guardian in this world and the hereafter
make me die in submission and join me with the righteous
this is of the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad
you were not present with them when they agreed together to plan them
and most people will not believe
you do not ask them any recompense for it
it is naught but a reminder unto all beings
how many a sign in the heavens and the earth they pass by while they pass away
and most of them do not believe in allah except while they associate others with him
do they feel secure that there will not come upon them a covering of the punishment of allah or that the hour will come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
say this is my way
i call to god with sure knowledge i and those who follow me
glory be to him
i am not among the idolaters
and we sent not before you any one except men from the townships whom we revealed to them
have they not travelled in the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those before them
and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who ward off evil
will you not understand
until when the messengers despaired deeming they thought that they were denied and thought that they were given the lie to our help came we pleased
and our punishment can not be averted from the guilty
in their stories is a lesson for those of understanding
this is not a thing of the past but the tradition of allah has not been mentioned in the books of any books
a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
alif lam mim ra
ra these are the verses of the book overflowing with allah
what has been revealed to you from your lord is the truth but most people do not believe
it is allah who raised the heavens without pillars that you can see then he istawa rose over the throne in the morning and the evening and the <unk>
he directs the affair he distinguishes the signs that you may be certain of encountering your lord
it is he who spread out the earth and placed mountains and rivers and rivers and every fruit in it he placed in it two kinds of fruits
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and in the land are neighbouring tracts vineyards and ploughed lands and ploughed crops and datepalms growing from it with date palms vines
we make some excel others in taste of others
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and if you should wonder then wondrous is their saying when we are dust shall we be raised up again new creation
they are the ones who disbelieve in their lord they are the ones who will have shackles around their necks
they are the people of the fire and there they shall abide for ever
they ask you to hasten the evil before the good although before the evil of the good you have suffered for them
but when the people offered a proclamation to allah before them
your lord is the lord of forgiveness for mankind
and verily thy lord is severe in retribution
the unbelievers say why has not a sign been sent down to him from his lord
you are only a warner
you are only a warner and there is no guide for every people
every moving thing has its appointed tremor
and i have appointed for a fixed term
and each thing is within the torah
he knows the unseen and the seen the great
allah is the high the great
it is he who conceals his speech and he who proclaims the night and he who goes out his secret in the darkness of night and he who goes out in the daytime
for he has attendant angels before him and behind him who guard him by allah s command
allah does not change what is in their hearts until they change what is in themselves
and if allah wills to visit a people there is no repelling it and they have besides him no protector
it is he who shows you the lightning for fear and hope and raises the heavy clouds
the thunder exalts his praise and the angels too celebrate him
he looses the thunderbolts and smites with them whomsoever he will
and allah is mighty in might
to him is the call of truth
those they invoke besides him do not respond to them
and the one who stretches his hands towards the sea – it does not reach the water that it may reach it
the prayers of disbelievers are in error
and to allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and their shadows in the morning and the evening
say who is the lord of the heavens and the earth
say allah
say have you taken for worship besides him who have no power over benefit or harm themselves
say is the blind equivalent to the seeing man equal or darkness and light equal
or have they appointed for allah partners who created like his creation so that the creation of them is like the creation
say allah is the creator of all things and he is the one the irresistible
he sends down water from the sky and riverbeds flow according to their capacity and the torrent carries a torrent carries a swelling scum
the current carries swelling froth and the fire which is set in the produce for men and the ornaments which they kindle the scum
thus allah expoundeth it unto the truth
as for the froth it is swept away from the parables
thus allah strikes his similitudes
for those who answer their lord is the best
but those who do not respond to their lord as to the call of the earth and if they possessed all that is before them they would offer it as ransom
for them is an evil reckoning and their refuge is hell
is he who knows that what has been revealed to you from your lord is the truth like one who is blind
only those possessed of minds remember
who fulfil the covenant of allah and do not break their covenant
who join what allah has commanded to be joined and fear their lord and dread the evil reckoning
and those who are patient in seeking the countenance of their lord and establish prayer and spend of that we have provided them secretly and openly and combat evil with good theirs shall be the abode of the hereafter
the everlasting gardens which they will enter and the righteous among their fathers their spouses and their descendants
and angels will enter unto them from every gate saying
peace be upon you for that you persevered
excellent is the ultimate abode
and those who break the covenant of allah after ratifying it and sever what allah has commanded to be joined and spread corruption on earth theirs shall be the curse of allah and theirs shall be the evil abode
allah enlargeth the provision for whomsoever he will and stinteth
but the life of this world is nothing but enjoyment of the hereafter and the enjoyment of the world is nothing but a passing enjoyment
the unbelievers say why has not a sign been sent down to him from his lord
say allah leads astray whom he wills and guides to himself whoever turns to him
those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of allah
lo in the remembrance of allah hearts find rest
those who believe and do good deeds theirs is blessedness and a beautiful return
and we have sent you o muhammad saw to a nation before whom we have sent you o muhammad saw recite to them what we revealed to you o muhammad saw that you may recite to them the quran which we have revealed to you o muhammad saw while
yet they deny the benevolent
there is no god but he
in him i have placed my trust and to him i turn in repentance
and if it were a quran whereby mountains could be moved by mountains or the earth could be moved by the dead could be moved by the dead by it
in fact all things are brought back to allah
do not the believers know that allah is the guided
or do those who believe know that it is the evident way of allah
as for those who disbelieve their home will be straitened until the promise of allah comes to pass
allah faileth not his promise
and before you o muhammad saw messengers ridiculed
so i respited those who disbelieved and then seized them how was my horror
and i allowed unto them a torment afflictive
is he who is watchful over what he earned and does not pronounce for any other god
yet they ascribe partners to allah
say name them
or do you inform him of something he knows about on the earth
or is it but a empty discourse
nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair to those who disbelieve and they are barred from the path
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide
for them is torment in this life and the torment of the hereafter is more severe
and they have no protector against allah
the likeness of the garden which is promised to the godfearing rivers flow its fruit is eternal and its shade
that is the recompense of the godfearing and the fire is the destiny of the unbelievers
those to whom we gave the book rejoice in what has been revealed to you
some of them are avid listeners to you
say “ i am commanded to worship god and i am commanded to worship him and to him i turn ”
to him is the return
thus we revealed it as a code of arabic language
and if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you you will have no protector or helper
and we sent messengers before you and we appointed wives and children and we gave them wives and they did not bring a sign except by the leave of allah and for every messenger is a decree determined
allah effaces and confirms what he wills and with him is the mother of the book
whether we show you a part of what we promise them or we cause you to die and to you is the same to you is your duty to convey the message
ours is the reckoning
do they not see how we aim to the land diminishing it in its extremities
and allah judges none can avert his judgement and he is swift at reckoning
those who have gone before them also plotted but allah s is the plan of allah
he knows what every soul earns
the unbelievers will know whose abode is the ultimate abode
and those who disbelieve say thou art not a messenger
say allah is sufficient witness between me and you and me and whoever is with me and the book of allah
alif lam ra
say o muhammad saw o my people
this is a book we have sent down to you that you may bring out the light by the permission of your lord to lead mankind into the light by the leave of allah the allmighty the alllaudable
allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
woe to the faithless for a severe punishment
those who prefer the life of this world dearer than the hereafter and seek to make it crooked and it is they who are the ones who are the guided
they are in extreme error
we sent not a messenger except with the tongue of his people that he might make them clear to them
allah leads astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills
he is the mighty the wise
we sent moses with our signs saying bring your people out from darkness into light and remind them of the days of god
surely in that are signs for every man enduring thankful
and remember when moses said to his people remember allah s favor upon you when he delivered you from pharaoh s people who were afflicting you with sons and sparing your women
in that is a great trial from your lord
and remember when your lord proclaimed if you give thanks i will increase you but if you are thankless my punishment is severe
moses said if you and all those who are thankless you will surely be in the earth and allah is allsufficient alllaudable
has there not come to you the tidings of those before you the people of nuh noah and those after them
none knows them except allah
their messengers came to them with clear signs but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent and we are in grave doubt regarding what you are in disquieting doubt
their messengers said “ will there be no doubt about allah the creator of the heavens and the earth and you will defer you to a stated term ”
they said you are but mortals like us
you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship
so bring us a clear proof
their messengers said to them “ we are only human beings like you but god bestows his favour upon you for he wills of his servants
it is not for us to bring you proof except by permission of allah
in allah let the believers put their trust
and why should we not put our trust in allah when he has guided us to our ways
we will endure patiently whatever you may be patient
in allah let all the trusting put their trust
the unbelievers said to their messengers “ we will surely expel you from our land or else you will return to our religion ”
so their lord inspired them saying we will destroy the harmdoers
and we will settle you in the land after them
this is for him who fears my station and fears my threat ”
they sought to help the messengers from allah and disappointed
before him is hell and he will be given to drink putrid liquid pus discharged from the fire
which he gulps and can scarce swallow and death can not die save him from every side but he will not die
and before him is a terrible punishment
the likeness of those who disbelieve in their lord their works are like ashes which the wind bloweth hard on a stormy day
they have no control over anything they have earned
that is the utmost misguidance
have you not seen that allah created the heavens and the earth with truth and he created you with a mighty creation
and that is not difficult for allah
and they will appear before allah in the earth and the weak will say to those who were arrogant leaders “ we were your followers ”
they will say had allah guided us we would have guided you
it is the same for us whether we rage or patiently endure we have no place of refuge
and satan will say when the matter is decided allah will bring you a promise of truth
i promised you but failed you and did not fail
i had no authority over you except that i called you and you responded to me
so do not blame me but blame yourselves
i can not help you nor can you help me
i disavow your associating me with allah in his divinity
indeed for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment
but those who believe and do good deeds will be admitted into gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein forever
their greeting therein will be peace
have you not seen how god sets a parable a good word is like a good tree its root in the sky and its branches are in a high garden
its fruit every season by the leave of its lord
allah coineth the similitudes for mankind so that they may reflect
and the parable of a bad word is like a bad tree uprooted from the surface of the earth having no stability
allah keepeth firm those who believe with the firm word in this world and in the hereafter
allah leads astray whom he wills and allah does whatever he wills
have you not seen those who exchanged the favor of allah with disbelief and landed their people in the house of ruin
hell wherein they will roast
what an evil destination
they have set up rivals to allah that they may lead people astray from his way
say enjoy yourselves for your destination is the fire
tell my servants who believe to establish prayer and spend of what we have provided them secretly and publicly before there comes a day in which we have provided them neither fear nor shame
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and sends down water from the sky and thereby producing fruits as sustenance for you and he subjected the ships to sail through the sea by his command and he subjected for you the rivers
and he subjected for you the sun and the moon and the night and the day and he subjected the sun and the moon
and he gave you all that you asked him
and if you count the favours of allah you will never be able to count them
indeed man is unfair and ungrateful
and remember when abraham said my lord make this city secure and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols
my lord they have led many people astray
so whoever follows me belongs to me
but whosoever rebels against me you are forgiving and merciful
our lord i have settled some of my progeny in a valley near your sacred house our lord in order that they may establish prayer and give thanks to them
our lord you know what we hide and what we reveal
nothing is hidden from allah in the earth or in the heaven
all praise be to allah who gave me ishmael and isaac despite my old age
my lord is the hearer of prayers
my lord make me establisher of prayer and accept my prayer and accept my prayer
my lord forgive me and my parents and the believers on the day when the reckoning will be established
do not think that allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do
he only defers them until the day when the eyes will stare in horror
scrambling towards their heads upturned they will be raised up their gaze and their hearts void
and warn mankind of the day when the punishment will overtake them then the wrongdoers will say our lord defer us to a while we will answer you have no respite until we will answer your call and you will be the ones who will answer
and you dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves and it was clear to you how we dealt with them
and we have put forth many parables for you
they planned their plan but their plot is known to allah
they are not able to hide the mountains nor were they able to hide their ruin
so think not that allah will fail to keep his promise to his messengers
indeed allah is allmighty allable of retribution
on the day when the earth will be changed into another earth and the heavens will come to pass before allah the one the irresistible
on that day you will see the sinners bound together in chains
their garments will be of pitch and the fire covering their faces
that allah may repay each soul for what it has earned
allah is swift in reckoning
this is a proclamation for mankind and that they may know that it is a god and that they may know that he is one god and that they may remember
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the book and a clear koran
perhaps those who disbelieve will wish that they were muslims
leave them to eat and enjoy and enjoy and hope and they will come to know soon
and we destroyed not a township but it was a known decree
no nation can outstrip its term nor can they delay it
and they say o ye unto whom the reminder hath been revealed lo thou art forsooth possessed
why bringest thou not angels unto us if thou art of the truthtellers
we do not send down angels except with the truth and they will not be reprieved
we have sent down the qur an ’ upon it and indeed we are the guardians of all things
and we sent messengers before you o muhammad saw to the sects of old
and never came there to them a messenger but they used to deride him
even so we make it enter into the hearts of the sinners
they do not believe in it the example of the ancients has passed away
and if we opened for them a gate in the heaven and they kept mounting thereto
they would say “ our eyes are dazed ”
we have placed constellations in the heaven and decked it out for the beholders
and we have guarded it from every accursed devil
except one who steals the hearing and the eyesight is pursued by a manifest flame
and the earth we stretched it out and placed firm mountains and we caused it to grow in it every kind of plant
and we have provided for you livelihood and for those whom you ride and for whom you do not provide for them are the providers
and there is not a thing but with us are its depositories and we send it down except in a known measure
we send the fertilizing winds and we send down water from the sky and thereby you drink and you are not maintainers of the earth and you are not its treasurers
it is we who give life and cause death and we are the inheritors
and we know the eager of you and those of you who lag behind
and indeed your lord will gather them all together and he is wise knowing
we created man from sounding clay of molded mud
and the jinn we created before from smokeless fire
and remember when your lord said to the angels i am going to create a human being out of dry ringing clay of loam moulded
so when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my spirit fall down prostrating yourselves to him
so the angels prostrated themselves all of them together
except iblis he refused to be among those who prostrated
he said “ o iblis what is the matter with you that you do not prostrate yourself ”
he said “ i am not a human being like the potter s ’ man to prostrate before me of molded mud ”
he said then get out of here for you are accursed
and indeed you are accursed until the day of recompense
he said my lord respite me till the day they are raised
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
till the day of the known time
he said my lord because you have led me astray i will surely adorn the path of error in the earth altogether
except your chosen slaves among them ”
allah said this is a straight path
my servants will have no authority over you except those who follow you
and verily hell is the promised place for them all
it has seven gates and for every gate is a portion designated
indeed the pious are amidst gardens and springs
enter it in peace and security
and we shall remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts and they shall be seated on couches facing each other
no fatigue shall touch them therein nor shall they ever be driven out of it
announce to my servants that i am the forgiving the merciful
and that my chastisement is the dolorous punishment
and tell them about the guests of abraham
when they entered unto him and said peace
he said “ we are afraid of you ”
they said do not be afraid we bring you the good news of a boy possessing wisdom
he said “ do you give me good news when old age has overtaken me
what is the news of what do you bring me
they said “ we bring you good news in truth so do not be one of those who despair ”
he said and who despairs of the mercy of his lord except those who are astray
he said “ and what is your business o messengers ”
they said “ we have been sent towards a guilty people ”
except the family of lot we shall deliver them
except his wife we have decreed that she shall be of those who stay behind
and when the messengers came unto the family of lot
he said “ you are a people stranger ”
they said nay we have come to you with what they have been doubting
we bring you the truth and indeed we are truthful
so travel with your family during the night and follow their backs
and whosoever of you turns away then it is they who will be afflicted with suffering
go to your place where you are commanded
and we inspired him that the matter is realized against them that they were destroyed
and the people of the city came rejoicing
he said these are my guests
and when it is said unto them my sons
affront me not
and fear allah and disgrace me not
they said did we not forbid you from entertaining strangers
he said these are my daughters if you must be doing
say o muhammad saw o my people
by your life they were in confused wandering blindly
so the shout seized them at sunrise
and we turned the city upside down and rained upon them stones of baked clay
surely in that are signs for those who think
and verily it is upon a road still they still are still ruined
surely in that is a sign for believers
and the dwellers of the wood surely were wrongdoers
so we punished them
both are on a highroad open highway visible highway
and the dwellers of al hijr also denied the messengers
and we gave them our signs but they turned away from them
they used to hew out dwellings from the mountains feeling secure
so the shout seized them in the morning
and that which they had earned did not avail them
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth and it is the hour
the hour is coming so forgive with gracious forgiveness
your lord is the allcreator the allknowing
and we have given you seven of the seven oftrepeated verses and the grand qur an
do not extend your eyes towards disbelief because we extend your hearts to the worldly life and to the believers – and do not grieve for them and lower your wing to the believers
and say i am the clear warner
so we sent down upon the dividers
those who broke the word into parts
by your lord we will question them all
concerning that which they used to do
so proclaim openly what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists
we suffice you against the mockers
who set up another god with god
they will come to know
we know that you are disheartened by what they say
so glorify your lord with praise and be among those who prostrate themselves
and worship your lord until the inevitable of the life of this world
the command of allah will come to pass so seek not to hasten it glorified be he exalted above that they associate with him
he sends down the angels with his command to the command of his slaves saying warn mankind of allah that there is no god but me so fear me
he created the heavens and the earth with truth high be he exalted above all that they associate with him
he created man from a drop of fluid and he is a quarreller
and the cattle he created for you in them is warmth and uses and uses for you
and there is beauty in them for you when you bring them home and when you drive them out of the evening
they carry your loads to a land which you could not reach except with difficulty
indeed your lord is gentle and merciful
and he created horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and for splendour
and he creates what you do not know
and upon allah is the direction of the right way and some of them are flawed
had he wished he would have guided you all
it is he who sends down water from the sky for you from it you drink and drink and pasture
and thereby he causes to grow the crops and olives and datepalms and grapes and all kinds of fruit
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
and he subjected the night and the day and the sun and the moon to you and the stars are subjected by his command
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and he has subjected for you on the earth of diverse colors
surely in that is a sign for a people who remember
it is he who subjected the sea to you that you may eat fresh meat from it and extract from it ornaments which you wear and you see the ships plowing through it so that you may seek his bounty and give thanks
and he placed mountains in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with you and rivers and roads that you may be guided
and waymarks and by the stars they find the right way
is he then who creates like one who does not create
will you not then remember
and if you count the favours of allah you will never be able to count them
allah is forgiving merciful
and allah knows what you hide and what you disclose
those they call upon other than allah are themselves created
they are dead not alive and they perceive not
so will they be raised up
your god is one god
but those who do not believe in the hereafter and they are disbelievers
they are the ones who believe in allah and are arrogant
indeed allah knows what they hide and what they disclose
he does not love the proud
and when it is said to them what has your lord revealed they say tales of the ancients
they will carry their loads on the day of resurrection and some of those whom they mislead without knowledge
evil is what they bear
those before them had also schemed
so allah came upon their edifice from the foundations so the roof fell down upon them from above them and the punishment overtook them from where they were unaware
then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and say where are my partners for whose sake you contended
those who were given knowledge will say disgrace and misery are on the day of misery
the angels who are wronging themselves and they will proffer it back and say “ we have wronged themselves ”
so enter the gates of hell to dwell therein forever
evil is the lodging of the proud
and it is said unto those who ward off evil what is it that your lord hath revealed they say good
for those who do good in this world there is good and the home of the hereafter is better
how excellent the abode of the godfearing
gardens of eden which they will enter beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever
thus allah rewards the muttaqun pious see v 2 2
those whose souls are angels take away while they are pure saying peace be upon you
enter paradise for what you used to do
are they waiting for anything else than that the angels should come to them or that your lord s command ’ should come upon them
likewise did those before them
allah wronged them not but they wronged themselves
so the evils of what they used to mock befell them and what they used to mock surrounded them
the idolaters say if allah had willed we would not have worshipped anything besides him nor would we have forbidden anything to do anything besides him
those before them had likewise did likewise likewise did those before them
the messengers have no power over anything except to convey the message
we raised a messenger to every nation saying worship allah and shun fake deities
then some of them allah guided and some justly were justly disposed to error
travel in the land and see what was the end of those who denied the truth
if you o muhammad saw are eager to guide them allah does not guide those whom he wills and they have no saviors
they swear by allah their strongest oaths that allah will not resurrect those who dies
yes he will raise up the dead but most people do not know
that he may clarify for them what they differed about and so that they were liars
when we intend to a thing we will it is
and those who emigrated for the sake of allah after they had been wronged we shall surely settle them in the world with a goodly lodging
they could know better if they only knew
those who endure patiently and in their lord they put their trust
we sent not before you except men to whom we revealed to them the people of the reminder if you do not know
we sent down to you with clear signs and we have sent down to you the psalms and the remembrance that you may explain to mankind what has been revealed to them so that they may reflect
do those who do evil feel secure that allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive
or that he will not seize them in their activities
they can not frustrate allah in the least
or that he will not seize them with a gradual wasting
indeed your lord is most kind and merciful
have they not observed what allah has created shadows incline to the right and left prostrating themselves to allah and to him in utter humility
and to allah prostrateth whosoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and the angels and the angels and the angels and the stars are not proud
they fear their lord above them and they do what they are commanded
allah has said do not take two gods for your worship
he is only one god
so fear me alone
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
his is the religion and his obedience
will you then fear any other than allah
whatever blessing you have is from allah
then when harm touches you you groan
then when he removes the adversity from you behold a group among you starts ascribing partners to their lord
so as to deny what we have given them
enjoy yourselves for you will soon know
and they assign a share of what we have provided them for something they do not know
by allah you will surely be questioned about what you used to fabricate
and they assign daughters to allah exaltations to him and for themselves what they desire
and when one of them is informed of the birth of a female his face becomes dark and he chokes with suppressed anger
he hides from the people because of the evil of the news he has been informed of what he has earned
is it either in the bargain or bury it in the dust
evil is what they decide
those who do not believe in the hereafter is the description of evil and allah is the most honourable the wise
if allah were to take mankind away from his slaves he would not leave any living creature on earth
but he grants them respite till a stated term
but when their term arrives they will not delay it by an hour nor will they precede it
and they attribute to allah that which they dislike and their tongues assert the lie that the best of their tongues would say theirs is the fire and they will be hastened to it
by allah we sent messengers before you o muhammad saw and the sects communities of old
satan made their deeds seem decorous to them so he takes care of them
they will have a painful punishment
we have sent down to you the book to explain to you that you may clarify for them what they differ and as a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
allah sends down water from the sky and quickens the earth after it had died
verily in this is a sign for people who listen
and indeed in the cattle there is a lesson for you we give you drink of that which is in their bellies between the filth bowels and the blood pure milk palatable to the drinkers
and from the fruits of the datepalm and grapes and the vine of the fruits which you derive intoxicants and wholesome indeed in that is a sign for people who understand
and thy lord inspired the bee saying take thou habitations in hills and in trees and in that which they construct
then eat of all fruits and follow the ways of your lord easy for you
so that there may be a lesson from their lord a drink drawn from the people of the earth wherein is healing for men
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
allah created you then he causeth you to die and he causeth you to die and he is the most knowing of all things
lo
but he who fears allah s unseen and his noble messenger is knowing and wise
allah has preferred some of you above others
and those of you who are preferred in respect of fortune over others
and those who have been favoured by their means they would not give their provision to those whom their right hands possess so that they may be equal with the best of those who do not believe in allah
and allah has made for you wives from yourselves and has made for you sons and grandsons and has provided you with good things
do they then believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the favor of allah
and they worship besides allah that which has no power to provide them from the heavens and the earth nor do they worship any thing
so do not strike similitudes for allah
indeed allah knows and you do not know
allah presents a parable a slave owned by his own soul and one who has no power over anything and is there any good in the cause of allah and he has provided them with good things
all praise belongs to allah but most of them do not know
allah sets forth another parable there is no example of two men but he has power over his servants
he wherever he directs him he brings out
is he equal to one who enjoins justice and is on a straight path
to allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth
the matter of the hour is only as a twinkling of the eye or even nearer
indeed allah is over all things competent
and allah brought you forth from your mothers wombs while you know nothing
then he gave you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye may give thanks
have they not seen the birds held in the sky
none holds them away except allah
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and allah has appointed for you houses from the hides of the earth a place of repose and for you and for you from the hides of cattle and on the day of settling you furnishing and from the hides of their wool and their fur and hair and
and allah has created for you out of that which he has created shade and has provided you with shelters in the mountains and has made for you garments to protect you from your enemy and coats of mail for defence
thus does he complete his favor upon you that you may submit
but if they turn away then your duty is only to communicate in clear terms
they recognize the favor of allah and then deny it but most of them are disbelievers
and the day when we raise up a witness from every nation they will not be permitted to make excuses nor will they be allowed to make amends
and when the wrongdoers see the punishment it will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
and when the idolaters see their associates they will say our lord these are our associates whom we used to invoke besides you
they will fling back at them and say “ you are liars ”
and they will proffer their submission to allah on that day and they will be lost from them
those who disbelieved and hindered others from the way of allah we will add punishment upon their punishment because of the transgressions they used to earn
and remember the day when we raise up from every nation a witness against them from amongst them and bring you as a witness against these
we have sent down to you the book and the clear book to proclaim everything and to warn you of every thing and a mercy and glad tidings for the muslims
indeed allah enjoins justice and kindness and generosity towards relatives and forbids immorality and oppression
he advises you so that you may take heed
fulfil the covenant of allah when you have covenanted and do not break your oaths after ratifying them
allah knows what you do
and do not be like her who breaks her thread after she has spun it strongly by deceit into bits
allah has made you a greater right than yourselves
allah is testing you thereby
he will clarify for you what you were differing
had allah willed he could have made you one community but he sendeth astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills
and you will be questioned about what you used to do
do not make your oaths a means of deceiving yourselves lest a foot should slip after it has been hindered from allah and you will have a great punishment
do not sell allah s covenants ’ for a small price
indeed what is with allah is better for you if you only knew
what you have runs to pass is with god
we shall award those who are patient in the way of allah a recompense for what they used to do
whosoever worketh righteously male or female and is a believer we shall grant him a goodly life and we shall grant him a good life in this world and we shall pay them their wages in full recompense for their deeds
and when you recite the qur an seek refuge in allah from satan the accursed
indeed he has no authority over those who believe and put their trust in their lord
his authority is only over those who befriend him and those who associate others with allah in his divinity
and when we replace a verse in another verse and allah knows best what he sends down they say you are but a fabricator
nay but most of them know not
say the holy spirit has brought it down from your lord to fortify those who believe and to make good news for those who believe
we know that they say “ it is only a human being ”
and the qur an is recited to him they blamed
and they have invented a tongue out of low arabic speech
indeed those who do not believe in the signs of allah allah does not guide the faithless
for them is a painful punishment
only those who do not believe in the verses of allah and it is they who are the liars
whoever disbelieves in allah after his belief except him who is forced by his heart and who is further astray
but those who willingly their breasts are in the way of allah and in the last day for them is a painful punishment
that is because they loved the life of this world and allah guideth not the disbelieving people
they are the ones whose hearts and hearing and sight and allah has sealed their hearts
they will be the losers in the hereafter
then surely thy lord thereafter thy lord thereafter striven hard after they had been persecuted and striven hard and endured patiently verily thy lord thereafter is forgiving merciful
on the day when every soul will come pleading for itself and every soul will be repaid in full for what it has earned and they will not be wronged
allah sets forth a parable of peace and security and security from every quarter its provision coming to it
but allah made it taste the hunger of hunger famine and fear that which they used to craft
and there had come to them a messenger from among themselves but they denied him so the punishment seized them while they were wrongdoers
eat of the lawful and good things wherewith allah has provided you and be grateful for him if it is him that you worship
he has forbidden you only carrion and blood and the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah
but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing it is forbidden
allah is forgiving merciful
and do not say “ this is lawful and this is unlawful ”
indeed those who invent lies against allah will not prosper
brief is their enjoyment in this world and theirs shall be a torment afflictive
and those who are jews we have already recounted to you before
we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
then verily thy lord thereafter is forgiving and kind
indeed abraham was a leader obedient to allah and he was not of the idolaters
and abraham was a nation of abraham a good man
thankful for his blessings
he chose him for his parents and guided him to a straight path
and we gave him goodness in this world and in the hereafter he will be among the righteous
then we revealed to you “ follow the religion of abraham the monotheist he was not one of those who associate others with allah ”
the sabbath was only ordained for those who differed about it
your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
call to the way of your lord with wisdom and good advice and argue with them in the best way
your lord is the best knower of him who strayeth from his way and he is the best knower of those who are guided
if you punish or retaliate retaliate with a equivalent of what you have committed is better for the patient
and endure patiently o muhammad saw your patience is not but from allah
and grieve not for them and be not distressed because of what they devise schemes
indeed allah is with those who fear him and those who are doers of good
glory to him who carried his servant by night from the sacred mosque to the farthest mosque whose precincts we have blessed him with a blessed landing which we have blessed him
he is the hearer the beholder
and we gave moses the book and made it a guidance for the children of israel saying choose not other than me
o descendants of those we bore with noah he was a thankful servant
and we decreed for the children of israel in the book you will surely create disorder twice and you will become tyrants
so when the promise of the first of the two we sent against you our servants of ours possessing great might and they entered it and the promise of allah was fulfilled
then we gave you a return of victory over them and we aided you with wealth and children and made you more numerous than we made you a host
and if you do good deeds you will do good and if you do evil it will be said to them and we will test you with a trial for the destruction of the sabbath and the fish who had spoken to allah and to justify the first time
and you are going to enter the city and it first
perhaps your lord will have mercy upon you
but if you revert we will revert
we have made hell a prison for the disbelievers
this quran guides to the path that is straight and gives good news to the faithful who do good deeds that for them is a great reward
and that those who do not believe in the hereafter we have prepared for them a painful punishment
man prays for evil as he prays for good and man is ever hasty
and we appointed the night and the day two portents
we erased the wonder of the night and the day that you may seek the bounty of your lord and that you may seek the bounty of years and the reckoning
and we have explained everything in detail
and we have attached to him a book that he will find his deeds a register and we will bring out for him on the day of resurrection a book that he will find wide open
read your scroll this day you suffice yourself against us
whosoever goes right only to his own loss and whosoever goes astray it is only for his own loss
no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another
no burdened soul carries a load until we have sent to punish until we have not sent a messenger
and when we destroy a town we command its affluent ones to obey allah and to obey those who are engaged in destruction
but they do not outstrip it and we destroy it for they will be seated in destruction and we destroy it completely
how many generations have we destroyed since noah
and sufficient is your lord as a beholder
whosoever desires this fleeting life we hasten to whom we will
then we shall appoint for him hell in the hereafter a while he will be roasted in the fire
and whosoever desireth the hereafter and striveth for it with the effort necessary due to him and strives for their striving due to allah
to these and to these extend from the gifts of your lord
and the gifts of your lord are not restricted
see how we have favored some of them over others and in the hereafter is greater in degrees
do not set up another god with god lest you sit down reproved forsaken
your lord has decreed that you worship none but him and that you serve him kindness and good to parents
if one of them or both of them attain old age with you say not fie nor reprove them with words but speak to them with kindness
and lower to them the wing of humbleness out of mercy and say my lord have mercy upon them as they brought me up when i was small
your lord knows what is in your hearts
if you are righteous he will surely be one of those who turn to him in repentance
and give the relative his rights and the needy and the wayfarer and squander not wastefully
the squanderers are brothers of the devils and the brothers of the devils
but satan is ungrateful to his lord
and if you turn away from them seeking mercy from your lord to admonish them but speak to them a gentle word that you may attain a gentle word
and do not keep your hand tied up your neck nor open it completely lest you sit blameworthy and regretful
your lord expands the provision for whomever he wills and restricts it
he is aware of his servants allseeing
do not kill your children for fear of poverty
we provide for them and for you
killing them is a great sin
and do not approach adultery
verily it is an indecency and an evil way
do not kill the sacred things which allah has forbidden except for the good things
and he who has no sin upon any soul except the mistake and his heir is killed or slaying the killer of justice
but he should not exceed the bounds in the matter of law he will be helped
and do not approach the property of the orphan except in the best manner until he reaches maturity and fulfil his covenant
and give full measure when you measure and weigh with even scales
that is better and excellent determination
and do not follow that of which you have no knowledge and the heart of the hearing and the sight and the heart of each of these will be questioned
and walk not in the earth exultantly surely thou wilt not tear the earth nor attain the mountains in height
the evil of all that is hateful in the sight of your lord
that is part of the wisdom your lord has revealed to you
do not set up another god with god lest you become condemned and damned into hell rebuked
has your lord favored you with sons and taken for himself daughters from among the angels
you say a monstrous thing
and we have explained in detail our revelations in this quran that they may remember but it increaseth them only aversion
say if there were other gods with him as they assert they would have sought a way to the lord of the throne
glorified be he and exalted above all that they say
the seven heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein glorify him
there is nothing that does not chant his praises but you do not understand their hymns of praise
indeed he is forbearing and forgiving
when you recite the qur an we place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden veil
and we have placed coverings over their hearts lest they understand it and in their ears deafness
when you mention your lord alone in the qur an they turn their backs in aversion
we know best what they listen to you when they listen to you and when they listen to you they say you are only following a man bewitched
see how they coin for you comparisons
they have gone astray and can not find a way
and they say when we are bones and fragments shall we be raised up as a new creation
say become ye stones or iron
or some created thing that is in your breasts yet harder to recreate from you
then they will say who will restore us
say he who created you the first time
they will shake their heads at you and say when will this be
say perhaps it will be nigh
the day when he will call you and you will answer him with his praise and you will think you remained in the world but little
tell my servants that they say words of justice
indeed satan incites ill feeling between them for satan is an enemy to man
your lord knows you best
if he wills he will have mercy on you
we have not sent you o muhammad as a guardian
we have not sent you o muhammad as a manager over them
and your lord knows best all those who are in the heavens and the earth and we gave excellence over others
say call upon those whom you assert other than allah
they have neither any hardship nor sowing you from the fire touched it
those they call upon themselves are themselves seeking means of access to their lord vying with his mercy and fear his punishment
verily the torment of your lord is a thing to beware of
there is no city but we shall destroy it before the day of resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment
naught hindereth us from sending portents save that the folk of the ancients belied them
and we gave thamud the shecamel as a visible sign but they wronged her
we do not send the signs except to frighten
and remember when we said to you “ your lord encompasses all mankind ”
and we made the vision of the qur an as a trial for mankind and the tree cursed in the qur an ’ and we made them a definite tree
we warn them but it only increases them in nothing but gross impiety
and when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they prostrated themselves all except iblis he said shall i prostrate myself before him whom you created from clay
he said “ so what do you bring me from a part of the fire if you stay behind me i will surely crush his progeny until the day of resurrection ”
he said begone “
hell is your recompense an ample recompense for those who follow you
and unsettle thou with thy voice and rally against them rally against them thy cavalry and thy foot and share with them in riches and children and children and share in them
but satan promises them nothing but deceit
indeed my servants there is no authority over you
your lord suffices as a guardian
your lord is he who drives for you the ships in the sea that you may seek the bounty of your lord indeed he is the most merciful
when a calamity befalls you on the sea those you invoke besides him vanish
but when he saves you to the land you turn away from him
and man is ever ungrateful
do you feel secure that he will not cause the shore to swallow you or unleash a tornado against you and then you will find no protector
or do you feel secure that he will not send you back into it a second time and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your thanklessness then you will find no prosecutor for us
and we have honoured the children of adam and carried them on land and sea and provided them with good things and preferred them over many of the others
on the day when we shall summon every group with his book and whoever is given his book in his right hand — those will read their records and they will not be wronged
but whosoever is blind in this world will be blind in the hereafter and the blind even more astray
they were about to tempt you away from what we revealed to you so that you may fabricate something else than that we had taken you as a friend
and had we not fortified you you would have found a little inclining towards them
then we would have made you taste double the life of the world and double it for us thou wouldst not find a helper against us
they were trying to expel you from the land and driving you away from it
but if they were to remain in their homes they would not have stayed but a little while
we sent our messengers before you o muhammad saw with our sunnah rule and you will not find any alteration in our way
perform the prayer at the decline of the sun from the meridian till the darkness of the night and the qur an ’ at dawn
verily the recitation of the quran is witnessed attended by the angels
and keep vigil the night as a supererogatory devotion for you it may be that your lord will raise you to a station of a mighty position
and lead me to the city with a sound entrance and grant me from your presence a sound judgement
grant me a sound entrance and frighten with it
and say truth has come and falsehood has vanished away from falsehood is ever bound to vanish
and we send down of the qur an that which is healing and a mercy and a mercy for the believers but it increases them only in loss
and when we bestow favours upon man he turns away and withdraws aside
but when evil befalls him he despairs
say each man works according to his own manner
your lord knows best who is best guided
they ask you about the spirit
say the spirit is of the bidding of my lord
and you have been given knowledge except a little
and if we willed we could take away what we revealed to you then you would not find a guardian over us
if you do not find for yourself any one of us we will take you as a trustee
except a mercy from your lord
his grace unto you is ever great
say if men and jinn banded together to produce the like of this qur an they would not produce the like of it even if they backed one another
we have explained in this qur an in arabic for mankind but most of them refuse to accept faith
and they say we will not believe you until you make a spring gush forth from the earth
or until you have a garden of palms and vines and cause rivers to gush forth in them abundantly
or until you cause the sky to fall upon us in fragments or you bring god and the angels before us
or until you have a house of gold or you ascend into heaven and we will not believe in you until you bring down a book we will read out whether we will not believe
say glory be to my lord
i am but a messenger
am i no messenger of allah than his
and naught prevented men from believing when guidance came to them save that they said hath allah sent a mortal as a mortal
say if there were on earth angels walking about in peace we would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel sent down to them
say allah suffices as a witness between me and you
he is aware of his servants and he sees the things they do
whomever god guides is the right way
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him thou wilt find no protectors apart from him
we shall muster them on the day of resurrection on their faces blind dumb deaf dumb and blind
their refuge shall be hell
whenever it subsides its flame we will intensify for them the fire
that is their recompense because they disbelieved in our signs and said when we are bones and fragments shall we be raised up as a new creation
have they not seen that allah who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them
he has appointed for them a term whereof they have no doubt
but the wrongdoers refuse nothing but unbelief
say to them if you owned the treasures of the mercy of my lord you would hoard over them
indeed man is ever stingy
and indeed we gave moses nine clear signs ask the children of israel
when moses came to pharaoh he said to him ‘ o moses i think that you are bewitched ’
moses said you know that none sent these signs save the lord of the heavens and the earth
i think o pharaoh i think you are one of those who have done
so he wished to drive them out of the land but we drowned him and all those who were with him
then we said to the children of israel after him dwell in the land and when the promise of the hereafter comes we shall bring you all together
we have sent down the qur an ’ with the truth and it has descended upon it
and we have not sent you except as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
and we have divided the qur an in parts that you may recite it to mankind slowly during parts of the night and we have revealed it to suit particular occasions
say believe in it or believe not in it when it is recited to them they fall down before it when it is recited to them
and they say glory to our lord is the promise of our lord to the unbelievers
and they fall down upon their faces weeping and it increases them in humility
say call upon god or call upon him the most merciful
whichever name you call upon his names belong to him belong the best names
and do not call your prayer nor murmur
so follow this between them
and say all praise belongs to allah who has not taken to himself a son and has not any partner in his sovereignty nor has he who has no helpers
and magnify allah with the magnificence allahuakbar
all praise be to allah who has sent down the book and has not placed therein any crookedness
valuable abhor that he may warn of his good news and give good news to the believers who do good deeds that theirs shall be a good reward
they will abide therein forever
and to warn those who say allah has taken a son
they have no knowledge of this nor did they have uttered a monstrous thing
monstrous is the utterance that comes out of their mouths they say nothing but a lie
perhaps you will kill yourself with grief chasing after grief
we have made whatever is on the earth as an adornment for it that we may test them in order that he may test them in deeds
and we will make it a barren dust
or deemest thou that the people of the cave and the inscription were a wonder among our signs
and mention when the youths betook themselves to the cave “ our lord give us mercy from yourself and furnish us with rectitude in our affair ”
so we sealed their ears in the cave for a number of years
then we awakened them to see which of the two groups could see best calculate the length of their stay
we narrate to you their story in truth
they were youths who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
and we strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth
we shall call upon no other god beside him lest a woman should be uttering for then we have uttered a blasphemy
these our people have taken to themselves gods other than him
why do they not bring a clear authority to them
and who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie against allah
and when you have withdrawn from them and what they worship other than allah and what they worship other than allah will forsake them and will appoint for you your affair facility and will increase his mercy
and you o muhammad saw see when it rose veering away from the right and when it moved away from their cave in the cave they lay in the cave and in the morning they were in the cave
that was one of the portents of allah
he whom allah guides is rightly guided but he whom he leads astray you will not find a guide to the right way
you would think them awake while they were asleep
and we turned them to the right and left them with their dog stretched its forelegs at the threshold
if you had looked at them you would have turned away from them and were filled with awe of them
likewise we roused them that they might question one another
one of them said how long have you stayed here
they said we have stayed a day or part of a day
they said your lord knows best how long you have stayed
send one of you to the city with this silver coin of yours and let him see that he has made some food and bring you food from it
let him be courteous and let no man know
if they come to know of you they will stone you to death or restore you to their religion
so if you do not prosper
so we made them known to the people of the city that they might know that the promise of allah is true and that the hour is certain
they differed among themselves about their affair and then they disputed with him said build over them a building about the matter of the unbelievers
their lord knows best who stayed away their faith
and their opponents said we shall build a place of worship over them
they will say three their dog the fourth of them will say five their dog is the fourth of them
and some say “ they are the sixth of them ”
they will say seven and their dog is the eighth of them
say my lord knows best their number
and none knows them except a few
so do not dispute concerning them except with clear proof and do not pronounce any of them to be able to do anything among them
and never say about anything i will do it tomorrow
except if allah wills
and remember your lord when you forget and say maybe my lord will guide me to nearer than this
and they stayed in their cave three hundred years and exceeded them in their cave for three hundred years
say allah knows best how long they stayed not in the heavens and the earth how well he sees and how can he have no protector
recite what has been revealed to you of the book of your lord
there is no refuge other than him you will find no refuge except him
and restrain yourself with those who call upon their lord morning and evening seeking his magnificence
and do not turn your eyes away from them desiring the glitter of this world
and do not follow him whose heart we have made neglectful of our remembrance and whosoever follows his own desires and his desires
and say the truth is from your lord
so let anyone who wishes believe and let him disbelieve
so whosoever will let him disbelieve in the fire we have prepared for him a fire whose pavilion is the same
if they ask for water they will be served with a drink like dregs of oil which will scald their faces
how dreadful a drink and what a wretched resting place
as for those who believe and do good deeds we shall not waste the wage of those who do good deeds
for them are the gardens of eden beneath which rivers flow
they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine green silk and brocade reclining therein on couches
how excellent a restingplace
and cite for them the parable of two men
we gave one of them two gardens of vine and we surrounded them with palm trees and we placed between them crops
each of the two gardens yielded its produce and failed not in the least we caused to gush forth in the midst of any grain between them
and he had fruit
he said to his companion “ i am more powerful than you in wealth and children
and he entered his garden wronging himself he said “ i do not think that this will ever perish ”
and i do not think the hour will occur
and if i am returned to my lord i will find a better place than this
his companion said to him “ do you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then from a spermdrop then from a spermdrop then proportioned you
but he is god my lord and i do not associate anything with my lord
and when you entered your garden why did you not say when you entered your garden allah wills there is no power except by allah
if you see me less than you in wealth and children
maybe my lord will give me something better than your garden and send down upon you a garden from the sky so that it becomes a bare earth
or its water will sink into the ground and you will not find it any way to be able to seek it
so his fruit became like the wind which he had spent upon it and he began to wring his hands for it
he was saying ‘ i wish i wish i had no partner ’
and there was no host to help him other than allah nor could he defend himself
he is the protection of the authority and the protection of allah the best reward
and propound thou unto them the similitude of the life of this world and the water we send down from the sky
then the vegetation of the earth mingles with it then the water rose scatter
allah is able to do all things
wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world and the good deeds of the hereafter and better with your lord are better in respect of hope
and on the day when we shall set the mountains in motion and you see the earth emerging and we muster them together leaving no one of them
they will be presented before your lord in rows and say “ you have come to us as we created you the first time
but you claimed that we would not appoint for you any meeting for you
and the record of deeds will be placed before her lord and you will see the guilty narration
and they will say “ woe to us
what small is this book that leaves nothing big or small or small
they will find their deeds confronting them and they will not be wronged
every soul earns what it has earned
and remember when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves to adam
he was one of the jinn and he was one of the jinni
and he will take him and his offspring as lords instead of me while they are your enemies
how evil a substitute for the wrongdoers
i did not make them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth nor their own creation nor do i take the misleaders as assistants
the day when he will say call to join me with my associates whom you claimed
they will call upon them but they will not respond to them but we will not destroy them and they will be a helper
and the guilty see the fire and know that they are about to fall into it and they will find no way to escape from it
and we have explained in this qur an in arabic for mankind all kinds of parables and man is most quarrelsome
and naught hindereth mankind from believing when guidance came unto them and from asking forgiveness of their lord save that the people of the ancients may come unto them or that they come unto them with a torment afflictive
we send not the messengers except as bearers of glad tidings and warners
but those who disbelieve dispute with falsehood to refute thereby
they have taken my verses and warnings to mockery
and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of his lord and turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent before him
we have placed coverings over their hearts lest they understand it and in their ears heaviness
and if you call them to guidance they will not be guided
your lord is the forgiver possessor of mercy
were he to take them to task for what they have earned he would have hastened for them the chastisement
but they have a tryst when they will find no escape from the doom
and these towns population we destroyed them when they committed injustices and we appointed for their destruction a tryst
and recall what time musa said unto his page i will not give up until i reach the junction of the two seas though i meet
so when they reached the junction of the two seas they forgot their fish and it took its way into the sea
so when they had gone further he said to his servant bring us our breakfast indeed we have encountered weariness over this our journey
he said ‘ what thinkest thou when we betook ourselves to the rock
i forgot the fish but satan made me forget to mention it not but the rock and made me forget to mention it
he said this is what we were seeking so they retraced their steps
then they found one of our slaves to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from us a knowledge from ourselves
moses said to him may i follow you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught
he said “ you will never be able to endure with me
and how can you bear patiently bear with what your knowledge encompasseth not
he said you will find me if allah wills patient and i will not disobey you in anything
he said if you follow me do not ask me about anything until i myself mention it to you
then they both proceeded till when they embarked on the ship he khidr scuttled it
he said have you made a hole in it to drown its people
you have done a dreadful thing
he said did i not tell you that you would not be able to patiently bear with me
he said do not take me to task for what i forgot and do not reprove me
so they departed until when they met a boy he slew him
he said have you killed a man for having killed a man
you have done a dreadful thing
he said did i not tell you that you would not be able to patiently bear with me
moses said if i ask you about anything after this then do not keep me from your presence you are a company of the unbelievers
then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town they asked its people for food but they refused to entertain them
they asked for them the way of allah and his people for food
there they found a wall about to collapse and he repaired it
so he made it proper
he said “ if you wished you could have obtained a payment for it ”
he said this is the parting between me and you
i will inform you of the interpretation of that you could not bear
as for the boat it belonged to poor people working in the sea
i wanted to make it defective for behind them a king seizing every ship by force
and as for the lad his parents were believers
i commit what he would have stoned to his wife and we have put them into ruin
so we intended that their lord should change him in exchange one better than him and nearer to mercy
as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and under it was a treasure belonging to them
their father was a righteous man
and your lord wanted their treasure to reach maturity and extract their treasure as a mercy from your lord
i did not do that of my own accord
that is the interpretation of that you could not bear patiently
they ask you about thulkarnain the pious
say i will recite to you something of his story
we established him in the land and we gave him the means of everything
so he followed a way
until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it setting in a muddy spring and found a people thereabout
we said o dhu lqarnain you may either punish them or treat them with kindness
he said as for him who doeth wrong we shall punish him and then he shall be returned to his lord who will punish him with a horrible chastisement
but as for him who believes and does good deeds he will have a good reward and we will speak to him with a mild command
then he followed another road
until when he reached the rising of the sun he found it rising upon a people for whom we had not appointed any veil against it
so it was
and we knew what he had in knowledge
then he followed another road
until when he reached between the two mountains he found a wall between them a people who could barely understand
they said o dhu lqarnain gog and magog are oppressing the land
so that we may make between you and them a barrier and we shall pay you a tribute
he said what my lord has empowered me in charity and that i may find better
so help me with strength and i will build between you a wall
until when they had been seated over he said blow until when he had been filled up with the fire he said blow
then he turned to the fire and said bring me tar
bring me molten brass he said to pour over it
so they could neither scale it nor could they pierce it
he said this is a mercy from my lord and the promise of my lord is true and the promise of my lord is true
on that day we shall leave them surging upon one another
and they will be like the <unk> of their destruction and when they are covered with the fruit of the trumpet
then we shall gather them together
on that day we shall present hell to the unbelievers
whose eyes were screened to my reminder and they were unable to hear
do the unbelievers reckon that they can take my servants as friends instead of me
we have prepared hell for the hospitality of the faithless
say shall we tell you who will be the greatest losers in respect of their works
those whose efforts are misguided while they are in the life of this world and they think that they are doing good deeds
they are those who deny the signs of their lord and the meeting with him so their works have failed and we shall not be of any weight
that is their recompense hell because they disbelieved and took my revelations and my messengers and my messengers
as for those who believe and do good works they shall be the gardens of paradise and shall live for ever
where they will abide for ever desiring to be removed from them
say if the sea were ink for the words of my lord the sea would be exhausted before the words of my lord had not been exhausted even though we would be brought back to it
say i am only a human being like you revealed to me that your god is one god
so whoever hopes for the meeting with his lord let him do good works and do not associate anyone with his lord in his divinity
kaf ha ya ayn saad
a mention of the mercy of your lord to his servant zechariah
when he called out to his lord a secret cry
he said my lord my bones have grown feeble and my head glows have been disappointed in my womb
i fear my relatives after me since my wife is barren
grant me from yourself a successor
who will inherit me and inherit from the house of jacob
and make him my lord acceptable unto thee
he said o zechariah we give you good tidings of a son whose name is john we have never given before
he said my lord give me a sign
how can i have a son when my wife is barren and i have reached infirm old age
he said so it will be your lord says it is easy for me and i created you before when you were nothing
he said my lord appoint for me a sign
he said your sign is that you will not speak to the people without any bodily defect
so he came out from his people to the sanctuary and signaled to them to sing the praises of allah morning and evening
o john we revealed to moses judge with determination
and we gave him wisdom while yet a child
and tenderness from us and purity and purity
he was devout
and dutiful to his parents and he was not a disobedient tyrant
and peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive
and mention in the book mary when she withdrew from her family to an eastern place
and she took seclusion from them a screen
then we sent unto her our spirit and he represented himself to her and he is a wellproportioned man
she said i seek refuge in the allmerciful from you
if you are fearful of me then beware
he said i am only a messenger of your lord to give you a boy who will be pure
she said how can i have a son when no man has touched me nor am i unchaste
he said thus will it be easy for me
and we shall make him a sign for mankind and a mercy from us and a mercy from us
this is a matter already decided
so she conceived him and retired to a far place
and the birth pangs brought her to the trunk of a palmtree she said oh would that i had died before this and become worthless
thereupon he called her from below her saying grieve not your lord has made a rivulet gush into you
shake the trunk of the palmtree towards you and it will drop fresh ripe dates upon you
eat and drink and be comforted
and if you see any human say “ i have vowed a fast to the most gracious ” so do not speak to any human today
then she brought him to her people carrying him and said o maryam mary you have done a monstrous thing
o sister of aaron your father was not a man of evil nor was your mother unchaste
so she pointed to him
they said how can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child
he said i am the servant of allah
he has given me the book and has made me a prophet
and he has made me blessed wherever i may be and enjoined upon me prayer and zakah
and has made me dutiful to my mother and he has not made me arrogant unprosperous
peace be upon me the day i was born and the day i die and the day i am raised up alive
such is jesus son of mary the word of truth
it does not behove god to take a son
glory be to him when he decrees a thing he says to it “ be ” and it is
and jesus said “ god is my lord and your lord so worship him
this is the straight way ”
but the factions differed among themselves
so woe to the faithless for the scene of a tremendous day
how well they will hear and see the day when they come to us
but the wrongdoers today are in manifest error
warn them of the day of regret when the matter is decided and they are in a state of carelessness and they are not believers
and we shall inherit the earth and all that is thereon and unto us they shall be returned
and mention in the book abraham he was a man of truth a prophet
when he said to his father o my father why worshippest thou what neither hears nor sees nor avails thee
o my father there has come to me knowledge which has not come to you
so follow me and i will guide you to a straight path
o my father do not serve satan verily satan is a rebel against the most compassionate lord
o my father i fear that a punishment from the most beneficent allah will touch you and you become a companion of the devil
he said have you turned away from my gods o abraham
if you do not desist i will stone you
so leave me alone for a while ”
he said peace be upon you my lord will forgive me and he will accept his mercy to me
i will withdraw from you and from those whom you call upon besides allah
i will call on my lord and i will not be disappointed in my lord
so when he had withdrawn from them and what they worshipped other than allah we gave him isaac and jacob and each we made a prophet
and we gave them of our mercy and we made them a tongue of truthfulness
and mention in the book moses
he was chosen and he was a messenger a prophet
we called him from the right side of the mount and brought him near to us
and we bestowed upon him his brother harun aaron a prophet
and mention in the book ishmael he was true to his promise and he was a messenger
he ordered his family to enjoin on the service of worship and pay the zakat
and he was ever living with allah
and mention in the book he was a man of truth and a prophet
and we raised him to a high position
these are the ones whom allah has blessed from among the prophets of adam and of the seed of adam and of those we bore with noah and from the offspring of abraham and israel
and they were those who when they recited to the verses of the allbeneficent we had guided them
when the verses of the most merciful were recited to them they fell down weeping
then there succeeded them a posterity who neglected the prayer and followed their lusts
so they will encounter one another
except those who repent and believe and do good works and do righteous deeds will be admitted to paradise and they will not be wronged
gardens of eden which the most merciful has promised his servants in the unseen
his promise will come to pass
they will hear therein no idle talk but only peace and evening and they will have their provision morning and evening
such is the garden which we shall cause those of our bondmen to inherit who are godfearing
and we angels descend not except by the command of your lord and all that is behind us and all that is behind us and all that is between them and all that is between them and all that is between us and your lord is not forgetful
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and all that is between them
so worship him and be patient in his service and he has no god other than he
the human being says “ when i am dead will i be raised up ”
does man not remember that we created him before when he was nothing
by your lord we will surely gather them and the devils then we will parade them hobbling on their knees
then we shall pluck out from every group whichever of them was most stubborn in rebellion to the most merciful
then we know best those most worthy of it
there is none of you but he will not be able to go back on it this is a decree of your lord
then we shall deliver those who are godwary and leave the harmdoers therein kneeling chapter 19
when our manifest signs are recited to them the faithless say to those who believe which of the two parties is better in station fairer than this which of the two groups
how many a generation we have destroyed before them who were superior in furnishings and appearance
say whosoever is in error the most merciful will prolong his span until they see what they have been promised
so when they see what they are promised they are promised
allah increases in guidance those who accept guidance
but the deeds of righteousness are better with your lord and better and excellent in respect of hope
have you seen him who disbelieves in our signs and says i shall certainly be given wealth and children
has he observed the unseen or has he taken a covenant with the most merciful
no we shall record what he says and we shall prolong his punishment endlessly
and we shall inherit from him that which he spake and he shall come to us alone
and they have taken besides allah gods that they may be a source of strength for them
nay but they will deny their worship of them and will become opponents to them
beholdest thou not that we have sent satans upon the infidels inciting them on the satans
so do not hasten against them we are counting by their number
on the day when we shall gather the righteous towards the most merciful the most beneficent allah
and drive the guilty to hell thirsty
they will have no power over the merciful except those who have received a covenant from the most merciful
and they say the most merciful has taken a son
you have indeed advanced something hideous
whereby the heavens are rent asunder and the earth splits open and the mountains fall down crashing down
that they ascribe a son to the most merciful a son
it is not suitable for the most merciful to take a son
there is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to the most gracious as a servant
he has enumerated them and counted them a full counting
each one of them will come to him on the day of resurrection alone
indeed those who believe and do good works will create the allmerciful
so we have made it easy in your tongue o muhammad saw that you may give good tidings to the muttaqun pious see v 2 2 and warn the people who fear allah and warn the disbelievers
how many a generation we have destroyed before them
do you see any one of them or hear a whisper of them
ta ha
we have not sent down to you the qur an that you should be distressed
but only as a reminder to him who tears
a revelation from him who created the earth and the high heavens
the most merciful who befitting his majesty established himself upon the throne
his is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whatsoever is inbetween the twain whatsoever is underneath the earth
and if you speak aloud or aloud he knows what is within the hearts
allah s is the excellent names there is no god except him to him belong the best names
has there come to you the story of moses
when he saw a fire he said to his family stay here i have noticed a fire for a fire perhaps i will bring you a brand from the fire perhaps i may find guidance
then when he came to it he was called “ o moosa
i am your lord
take off your shoes you are in the sacred valley tuwa
i have chosen you
so listen to what is revealed to you
verily i am allah
la ilaha illa ana none has the right to be worshipped but i so serve me and perform assalat iqamatassalat
the hour is coming i shall surely be recompensed for what it endeavors and i shall be rewarded for what he strives
so let him not turn you away from it and who does not believe in it and who does not drive you away from it lest you perish
and what is that in your right hand o musa moses
he said “ this is my staff ”
i lean on it and herd with it and with it i beat down leaves for my sheep and i have other uses for it
he said moses cast it down
so he threw it down and lo it was a serpent running
he said fear not we shall restore it to its former state
and put your hand inside your armpit it will come out white without disease it will come out white without disease
that we may show you some of our greatest signs
go to pharaoh for he has transgressed
he said my lord expand for me my breast
and ease my task for me
and loose a knot from my tongue
that they may understand my speech
appoint for me a minister from my family
harun my brother
strengthen me with him
and make him my task
that we may glorify you much
and remember you much
indeed you are of us ever seeing
he said your request is granted
we had favored you before this
when we inspired in your mother what we inspired
put him in the chest and cast him into the river and cast it into the river
the river will cast him into the river and an enemy of his enemies and an enemy of his enemies
and i lavished my love for you in order that you might be reared in my sight
when your sister walked up for you saying shall i direct you to someone who will take care of him
so we returned you to your mother that she might be comforted and not sorrow
then you killed the soul
and you stayed a number of years
then you stayed in the case of midian after moses
and i have chosen thee for myself
go you and your brother with my signs and do not slacken in remembrance of me
go both of you to pharaoh for he has transgressed all bounds
and speak to him with gentle words perhaps he may take heed or fear allah
they said our lord verily we fear lest he should persecute us or become violent
he said fear not verily i am with you hearing and seeing
so go to him and say ‘ let the children of israel go with us and let the children of israel go with us and do not be among the children of israel
we have come to you with a sign from your lord
and peace be upon him who follows guidance
it has been revealed to us that punishment will befall him who denies the truth and turns away
pharaoh said who is the lord of you two o moses
he said our lord is he who gave everything its form and then guided it
pharaoh said then what is the case of the former generations
moses said the knowledge thereof is with my lord recorded in a book
my lord neither errs nor forgets
he who made the earth a bed for you and traced for you therein and sent down water from the sky
and we have brought forth from it gardens of beauty wherein there is beauty
eat and pasture your cattle
verily in that are signs for a people of understanding
and we created you from the earth and we will return you into it and from it we will bring you forth a second time
and we showed him our signs all of them but he denied them and refused
he said have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic o moses
so we will surely bring you magic so leave between us and you a sorcery which neither we nor you will fail to keep in the land nor you will be a place of return
moses said your tryst is on the day of the feast and let the people assemble
then pharaoh withdrew and gathered his stratagem
moses said to them woe to you
or do you invent a lie against allah lest he should destroy you with grief
they disputed their plan among themselves and they would have differed with one another
they said ‘ these are two magicians who are in the grave
they want to expel you from your land and wipe out their religion out of your object
so prepare your strategy and come in rows and whoever prospered today shall win the successful
they said moses either you throw first or we shall be the first to throw
he said nay you cast
so the magicians fell down to moses owing as if their ropes and their staffs were running before
so moses felt afraid within himself
we said fear not verily thou art the superior
throw down what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have crafted and what they have crafted is only a magician s stratagem
but he does not succeed wherever he does
so the magicians fell down prostrate and said we believe in the lord of moses and aaron
pharaoh said you believed in him before i gave you leave
i will cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of palmtrees
then you will know who is more terrible in punishment and more lasting
they said we will not prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us and that we created you
so decree whatever you wish
you can only rule in this life of the world
we have indeed believed in our lord that he may forgive us our sins and the magic which you compelled us to practice the magic and allah is best and more lasting
whoever comes to his lord with a guilty of hell – he will neither die nor live
but whosoever comes to him with a believer having done good deeds for them is the highest degrees
gardens of eden underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally
such is the recompense of him who purifies himself
and we inspired moses saying travel through my servants by night and strike for them a dry path in the sea
do not fear the promise of firaun and do not be afraid
pharaoh pursued them with his hosts but they were overwhelmed by the sea
pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them
o children of israel we delivered you from your enemy and made a covenant with you on the right side of the mount and sent down upon you manna and quails
saying eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you and transgress not in this lest my anger should alight on you and upon whomsoever my anger alights hands have fallen on you and upon the head of satan lest my anger alight
and i am indeed forgiving and the muslims who repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance
what has made you hurry o moses
he said they are close behind me
my lord i hastened to you that you may be pleased
he said “ we have tested your people after you departed and samri has misled them ”
and moses returned to his people angry and grieving he said o my people did your lord not promise you a good promise
did the time of the covenant seem long to you
or did you want to hasten the wrath of your lord descend upon you so you broke your promise to me ”
they said we did not break our promise to you with our choosing of our choosing and we were unable to carry the burdens of the people
he said “ we have lost the tablets and the hair of the fire ”
so we threw the samaritan of the samaritan ’
then he produced for them a calf a mere body which lowed and a lowing sound and a lowing satan made this is your god but the god of moses and the forgotten
did they not see that it did not answer them and did not harm them in any way nor benefit
and aaron had already told them before this you were indeed thieves
your lord is the merciful
follow me and obey my order
they said we will not stop worshipping it until moses returns to us
moses said o aaron what prevented you when you saw them going astray
from following after me
son of my mother aaron said o my mother do not seize me by my beard or my hair
i feared lest you should say you have caused division among the children of israel and you have not respected my word
moses said and what is your business o samiri
he said i saw what they did not see
i flung a handful of dust from the messenger s trail ’ and threw it into the fire
thus my soul commended to me
he said begone
it is said to the destitute ‘ do not touch me ’
and whosoever puts you into this your life
and you will not be able to keep it
and look you to me
for which you will not fail to keep
we will burn it and scatter it into the sea
your god is only one god there is no god but he the all things in his knowledge
thus we narrate to you reports of stories in this quran and we have given you a reminder from us
whosoever turns away from it will bear a burden on the day of resurrection
they will abide in it forever what an evil burden for them on the day of resurrection
the day when the trumpet is blown on that day we shall gather the sinners together with terror
they will murmur among themselves you stayed not but ten days
we know well what they will say
the most just among them will say you stayed in the world but you remained a day
they will ask you about the mountains
say my lord will scatter them like dust
and leave them desolate waste
you will see no crookedness or <unk>
on that day they will follow the summoner without any deviation
their voices will be hushed before the allbeneficent and you will hear nothing but a murmur
on that day intercession will not avail except for him whom the most merciful has given permission and whose words are recited to him
he knows what is before them and behind them and what is behind them while they do not comprehend him
faces will be humbled before the living the eternal
and he who carries injustice shall be failed in the burden of the burden of those who have been slain
but he who does a good deed and does good deeds will have no fear of injustice or loss
and thus we have revealed it an arabic quran and we have sent it down in arabic so that they may avoid evil or that they may be godfearing
so exalted be allah the true king
and do not hasten with the qur an before its revelation has been completed to you
increase me in knowledge
and indeed we did not urge upon adam before this
but we found him lacking in firmness
and remember when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they prostrated themselves all except iblis he refused
we said “ o adam this is an enemy to you and your wife
so let him not expel you from paradise and plunge you into paradise
verily you have neither been hungry nor naked therein
nor thirst therein nor exposure
then satan whispered to him saying o adam will i direct you to the tree of eternity and a kingdom that will not break
so they both ate of it and their shame became apparent to them
so did they rebelled against their lord s command ’ and he became astray
so that they shall approach the tree of eternity and he shall muster him with the earth
then his lord chose him and turned to him clemently and guided him
he said go down hence one of you is an enemy to the other
but when there has come to you guidance from me then whoever follows my guidance will neither go astray nor go astray
but whosoever turns away from my remembrance his will be a narrow life and we shall raise him blind on the day of resurrection blind
he will say “ my lord why have you raised me blind though i was seeing ”
he will say “ so it is our signs came to you and you forgot them so today you will be ignored ”
thus do we recompense those who transgress the limits and do not believe in the signs of their lord
and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and more enduring
is it not a guidance to them how many generations we destroyed before them amid whose dwellings they walk
verily in that are signs for men of understanding
and had it not been for a word that preceded from your lord and a stated term would have been fastened
so bear patiently that they say and hallow the praise of their lord before the rising of the sun and before the setting of the night and the day and the watches of the night and the day that you may be pleased
and strain not your eyes toward that which we have given them of the splendour of the life of this world that we may test them thereby
your lord s provision is better and more lasting
enjoin upon your family and be patient in it
we do not ask you for sustenance
and the sequel is for piety
and they say why does he not bring us a sign from his lord
has there not come to them the book of what is in the former scriptures
and if we had destroyed them with a punishment before this they would have said our lord why did you not send us a messenger before this they were abased before we would have followed your signs and were humiliated
say each one of them is waiting so wait
and you will know who are the people of the right path and who are rightlyguided
the reckoning of mankind is drawing near and they turn away heedlessly
no fresh reminder comes to them from their lord except when they listen to it they listen to it
their hearts are diverted
the wrongdoers whisper to one another saying ‘ this is nothing but a human being like you
will you then see the quran with clear proofs
he said my lord knows all that is spoken in the heavens and the earth
he is the hearer the knower
nay they say these are confused dreams nay he has forged it nay he is a poet
so let him bring us a sign even as the former men were sent as messengers
not a township before them we destroyed but they believed
will they then believe
we did not send any apostles before you except men to whom we revealed
ask the people of the reminder if you do not know
we did not make them bodies that ate not food nor were they immortal
then we fulfilled the promise we fulfilled the promise to them and we delivered them and those whom we willed and destroyed the transgressors
we have sent down to you a book containing a reminder for you
will you then not understand
how many a city we have smashed that were sinful and we raised after them another people
then when they tasted our punishment they started fleeing from it
they said ‘ do not flee to your comforts and to return to you ’
and that which is revealed unto you so that ye may be questioned
they said woe to us
we were indeed wrongdoers ’
and that declaration of theirs ceased not to cry until we made them extinct
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in play
had we intended to take a diversion we could have found our fathers with it we would have taken it as a son
nay but we hurl the truth against falsehood so it vanishes and behold it vanishes
woe to you for what you allege about
to him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth
those who are with him are not too proud to worship him nor are they weary
they glorify him night and day and they do not slacken
or have they taken from the earth who raise the dead
no
had there been gods in the heavens and earth they would have been ruined
glorified be allah the lord of the throne from all that they ascribe unto him
he will not be questioned about what he does but they will be questioned
or have they taken gods besides him
say bring your proof this is the reminder for those before me and the remembrance of those before me
nay but most of them know not the truth so they are turning away
and we sent not before you any messenger but we inspired him saying la ilaha illa ana none has the right to be worshipped but i so worship me
and they say the most beneficent allah has begotten a son or children
glory be to him
nay but they are honoured slaves
they do not outstrip him in speech and they act as it is they who command
he knows what is before them and what is behind them
they intercede for him only for intercession is allah s permission and they tremble in awe of him
and if one of them should say i am a god besides him we shall recompense him with gehenna such a recompense for the evildoers we recompense the evildoers
have the unbelievers not seen that the heavens and the earth were one solid mass then we tore them out of water and we made every living thing to fall down
and we have created every living thing
will they not believe
and we placed mountains in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them and we placed therein ravines to be paths so that they may be guided
and we made the sky a protected ceiling but they are disregardful of his signs
it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each floating floating in an orbit floating
we did not grant immortality to any human before you
then if you die will they live for ever
every soul will taste death and we will test you with a trial and a trial for the good
and to us you will be returned
and when the faithless see you they take you for mockery saying is this the one who mentions your gods
and they are the very ungrateful of arrahman
man is created of haste i will show you my signs so ask me not to hasten
they say when will this promise come if you are truthful
if only the faithless knew when they will not ward off the fire from their faces and their backs and their backs and their backs and they will not be helped
nay but it will come upon them suddenly dumbfounding them
they will not be able to repel it and they will not be reprieved
and before you o muhammad saw were also mocked but those who mocked at the messengers ridiculed them
say who guards you by night and by day from the most beneficent allah
nay but they turn away from the remembrance of their lord
or do they have gods who can defend them against us
they can not help themselves nor can they help themselves
nay we generously provided them and their fathers until they lived in ease
see they not that we gradually reduce the land to its extremities
are they the victors
say i am only revealed to you
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
if a breath of your lord s punishment ’ touches them they will surely say “ woe to us
we have indeed been wrongdoers ’
and we set for the scales of resurrection
no soul will be wronged
and even if it be the weight of a mustardseed we will bring it forth
and sufficient are we as reckoners
and assuredly we gave musa moses and harun aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder for the godfearing
those who fear their lord in secret and apprehend him while they are the fearful of the hour
and this is a blessed reminder which we have sent down
will you then deny it
we had given abraham the guidance of the torah and we knew him well
when he said to his father and his people what are these statues to which you cling
they said we found our fathers worshipping them
he said “ you and your fathers were in manifest error ”
they said “ are you telling us the truth or are you just playing ”
he said nay but your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth
i am one of those who testify
by allah i will devise a plan against your idols after you have gone away
so he broke them into fragments except their biggest so that they may return to it
they said who has done this to our gods he is indeed one of the wrongdoers
they said we heard a youth speak of them who is called abraham
they said bring him before the people s eyes that they may testify
they said did you do this to our gods o abraham
he said rather it was this biggest of them that did it
ask them if they can speak
so they turned to themselves and said “ you are the wrongdoers ”
then they reversed their heads saying you know well that these are the foolish
he said then do you worship besides allah that which can neither profit you nor harm you
fie upon you and upon that which you worship besides allah
will you not understand
they said burn him and help your gods if you are doing
we said o fire be coolness and safety for abraham
they wished to harm him but we made them the worst losers
and we saved him and lot and brought him to the land which we had blessed for the worlds
and we bestowed upon him isaac and jacob and each one of them we made righteous
and we made them leaders guiding by our command and we inspired them to perform the prayer and to pay the alms and to pay the alms
they worshipped us only that they worshipped
and we gave lut the kingdom of lot and knowledge and we delivered him from the town that had been doing
verily they were a people who were fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
and we admitted him into our mercy verily he was of the righteous
and noah when he called before him and we answered him and delivered him from the great distress
and we helped him against the people who denied our signs
so we drowned them all together
and david and solomon when they went into the field when the sheep of the people overran the sheep of the sheep we were witness to their judgment
we made solomon to understand it and to each we gave judgement and knowledge
and we subjected the mountains to glorify allah with david and the birds and subjected the birds
it is we who did it
and we taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to fortify you against your own violence
will you then give thanks
and to sulaiman solomon we subjected the wind strongly raging running by his command towards the land which we had blessed
and we are cognisant of everything
and of the satans were some who dived for him and did work besides him and we were warders over them
and remember our worshiper job when he called out to us
when he called out to his lord he said “ i seek refuge with you ”
so we answered his prayer and removed his affliction from him and we removed his family and we gave him his family and the like of their forefathers abraham and a mercy from us and a reminder for the worshippers
and ishmael and enoch and ezekiel each one of them were patient
and we admitted them into our mercy they are of the righteous
and remember when he went away in anger and said “ this is a great deal with us ” – and you thought that we may not ascribe any partners to him – and you would not have any partner in the great sin except for the unjust ”
so we answered him and saved him from the anguish
thus do we save the believers
and remember zakaria when he called out to his lord “ my lord leave me not solitary though you are the best of inheritors ”
so we answered him and we bestowed upon him john and we cured his wife for him
they raced to one another with good deeds and they used to call upon us with hope and awe and were humble before us
they were indeed a faithful
and remember she who guarded her chastity virgin maryam mary we breathed into her of our spirit and her son and her son a sign for all beings
o mankind this community of yours is one religion and your religion
so serve me alone
but they split up their religion among themselves all together
and whosoever worketh a believer while he is a believer there will not be denied the good
we record it for him
it is a ban upon any town that we have destroyed that they will not return to the world
until when gog and magog are unloosed and they press down from every slope
and the true promise draws near to the true eyes of those who disbelieve will stare in horror
we were heedless of this
nay we were heedless of this nay but we were zalimun wrongdoers and disbelievers etc
verily you and those whom you worship besides allah are fuel for hell and you will be firewood for it
had these been gods they would not have descended into it
all shall abide therein
there will be groaning for them and they will not hear therein
indeed those who deserved goodness will be kept far away from him
they will not hear its hissing and they will abide in it forever
the greatest terror will not grieve them and the angels will receive them saying this is your day which you were promised
and remember the day when we shall roll up the heavens like a written scroll for the first time and we shall repeat it the first creation and we shall restore it to the first creation
and we have written in zabur psalms after the reminder
verily in this is a proclamation for a people who worship
and we have sent you o muhammad only as a mercy from us and the believers
say it is revealed to me that your god is one god
will you then submit to him
if they turn away say “ i have announced to you all alike ”
and i know not whether what you are promised is near or far away
he knows what is said openly and what you hide
i know not that it is a trial for you and an enjoyment for a while
he said my lord judge thou with truth
our lord is the merciful whose help is sought against what you describe
o mankind fear your lord verily the earthquake of the hour is a thing
on the day when you will see it every suckling female infant shall be suckled by the suckling and every pregnant woman will abort her suckling woman and she shall discharge be suckled
and you see men drunk yet they are drunk
allah is severe in punishment
among the people are those who dispute concerning allah without any knowledge and follow every rebellious devil
it is decreed for him who taketh hold of him and he will mislead him in the punishment of the fire
o mankind if you are in doubt concerning the resurrection then verily
we created you from dust then from a drop of seminal fluid then from a clot then from a clot then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless that we may make you obscure
and we cause the drop of sperm to die and then we leave you to die and then bring you forth as infants then you reach your maturity
and among you is he who dieth young and among you is he who is brought back to him who is brought back to him in the worst of age
and thou seest the earth barren but when we send down water thereon and lo it bringeth forth every kind of lovely growth
that is because allah is the truth and because he revives the dead and because he revives the dead
and because the hour is coming no doubt of it and allah will resurrect those who are in the graves
and among mankind is he who disputeth concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or a book luminous
turning aside disdainfully to lead away from the path of allah
for him is disgrace in this world and we shall make him taste the punishment of burning
that is for what your hands have forwarded and because allah is not oppressor of his bondmen
and among the people is he who worships allah on edge
but if there comes a good thing he is content with it
but if he wills to come he loses both this world and the hereafter
that is the obvious loss
he invokes besides allah that which can neither harm nor benefit him
that is the extreme error
he invokes someone whose harm is closer than his benefit
an evil ally and an evil restingplace
allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow
allah does whatever he pleases
and whosoever thinks that allah will not help him in this world and in the hereafter let him stretch a rope to the ceiling and let him sever his rope to the rope of allah and let him sever what enrages him
even so we have sent down this quran as clear signs
allah guideth whom he will
verily those who believe and those who are judaised and the sabians and the nazarenes and the magians and the idolaters verily allah is witness over everything
allah is witness over all things
do you not see that to allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains the trees and the beasts and many people
many are there on whom the punishment is justified
whomever allah humiliates for him who humiliates honor
indeed allah does whatever he wills
these are two disputants who have disputed concerning their lord
as for those who disbelieve garments of fire will be cut out for them and scalding water will be poured down over their heads
which will dissolve their skins and their skins
for them are hooked rods of iron
whenever they try to try to get out of it they will be driven back from it and it will be said to them taste the punishment of burning
allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow
they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl and their garments therein will be silk
they were guided to good speech and guided to the path of the alllaudable
those who disbelieve and hinder men from the way of allah and from the sacred mosque which we have appointed for mankind and the visitor alike and whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein we shall make him taste a painful punishment
and remember when we showed abraham the site of the house saying do not associate anything with me and purify my house for those who stand up and those who stand in prayer and those who bow and prostrate themselves
and proclaim the pilgrimage they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel they will come from every deep ravine
that they may witness benefits themselves and mention the name of allah upon them and pronounce the name of allah over the beast of cattle and the cattle eat of the meat
then let them fulfil their vows and go about their vows and circumambulate the ancient house
that is the command
and whosoever magnifieth the sacred things of allah it will be better for him with his lord
permitted to you except what is recited to you except what is recited to you
so shun the abomination of idols and shun false speech
being pure only to god being pure faith in associating others with him
and he who ascribes partners to allah is as a previous likeness of the birds and is snatched away from the sky and the birds were snatched away
and whosoever venerates the sanctity of the symbols of allah verily this is from the hearts of the hearts
and in them are benefits for you so long as you sacrifice an appointed time for sacrifice the ancient house
for every nation we have appointed a rite that they pronounce the name of allah over the beast of cattle that he has provided them
your god is one god so serve him and obey you
and give good tidings to the humble
whose hearts tremble when allah is mentioned who patiently endure and who perform assalat iqamatassalat and spend of that we have provided them
and the camels we have appointed for you o muhammad saw as a sacrifice
in them is good for you
pronounce the name of allah over them as they stand in lines
then when they fall down upon their sides eat thereof and feed the contented and suppliant
thus we have subjected them to you that you may be grateful
neither their flesh nor their blood their blood
and the piety of allah is mentioned in your hearts
thus does allah make clear to you that you may magnify allah for his guidance
and give good news to the charitable
indeed allah defends those who believe verily allah loveth those who have no increase of the disbelievers
permission to fight has been given to those who fought against because they were wronged
indeed allah is able to give them victory
those who were unjustly evicted from their homes without any right except because they said our lord is allah
and if allah were to disperse many by means of others would have been demolished monasteries churches synagogues and mosques wherein the name of allah is much mentioned much
allah will surely help those who help him
indeed allah is allstrong allmighty
who if we give them power in the land we order that they establish worship and pay the poordue and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong
and allah is the sequel of the matters
and if they belie you o muhammad then the people of nuh noah ad and thamud also gave the lie to you
and the people of abraham and the people of lot
and the people of madyan too belied moses
so i reprieved the disbelievers gave the lie to the truth and then seized them
how was my rejection
how many a township we have destroyed while it was a sinful canopy and it was fallen down upon their turrets and how many a lofty tower that lie abandoned
have they not travelled in the land so that they may understand the earth and have ears to hear with which they have ears to hear
it is not the eyes that are blind but it is the hearts that grow blind
they ask you to hasten the punishment
allah faileth not his promise
a day with your lord is like a thousand years of your counting
and how many a city did i give respite although it was dead to the unbelievers were harmdoers
to me is the return
say o mankind i am only a plain warner to you
as for those who believe and do good deeds for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
and those who strive against our signs seeking to frustrate them they are the people of hell
and we never sent a messenger before you but when he recited to moses a prophet they disputed in his mind what he recited
but allah abolisheth that which satan proposeth
then allah is allknowing allwise
that he may make what satan has thrown into temptation and in whose hearts is a disease in whose hearts is sickness are hardened and whose hearts are hardened
the wrongdoers are in profound discord
and that they may know that it is the truth and that it is the truth that you are the truth
so the fear of him and the hearts of those who believe in him
indeed allah guides those who believe to the right path
and those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt about it until the hour comes upon them suddenly or there comes upon them the chastisement of a barren day
the sovereignty on that day will belong to allah he will judge between them
as for those who believe and do good works they shall be in gardens of bliss
but those who disbelieve and denied our signs for them awaits a humbling chastisement
those who emigrated in the way of allah and were slain or died allah will provide for them a good provision and verily allah is the best of providers
he will admit them to a place which they will enter
allah is knower indulgent
that is so whoever retaliates similarly for the sake of allah and then he is oppressed and then he will assist him indeed allah is oft pardoning and forgiving
that is because allah merges the night into the day and plungeth the day into the night and because allah is hearing beholding
that is because allah is the truth and that which they call upon besides him is false and because allah is the supreme the grand
have you not seen how allah sends down water from the sky and the earth turns green
god is wellinformed of all creatures aware
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and whosoever turneth away verily allah is the absolute the owner of praise
have you not seen how allah has subjected to you all that is in the earth and the ships sail in the sea by his command and he holds the sky by his leave and he restrains the earth unless it be in the sky
indeed allah is to mankind most merciful
it is he who gave you life then he will cause you to die and then will bring you back to life indeed man is ungrateful
for every nation we have appointed a sacred mosque
so do not argue with you in this matter
and invite them to your lord you are on a straight path
and if they dispute with you say allah knows best what you do
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning what you used to differ
do you not know that allah knows all that is in the heaven and earth
surely that is in a book surely that is easy for allah
and they worship besides allah that for which he has sent down no authority and that they have no knowledge of it
the wrongdoers will have no saviors
when our clear verses are recited to them you will recognize disgust on the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval
they are nearly running on the verge of those who recite to them
say shall i inform you of what is worse than this
allah has promised it to the faithless
and what an evil outcome
a similitude is coined so listen to it attentively while those whom you call upon besides allah are able to create a fly even if they banded together
and if the fly should steal away from them they could not rescue it from it
weak are the pursuer and pursued
they do not value god as he should be valued
indeed allah is allstrong allmighty
allah chooses messengers from angels and from mankind
indeed allah is hearing and seeing
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and to allah all matters are returned
o you who believe bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your lord and do good that you may succeed
and strive for allah with the striving due to him
he has chosen you and has not placed upon you any obstacle in your religion
he has named you muslims before and in this qur an ’ is a messenger so that you may be witnesses over the people and give the messenger of allah and that you may be witnesses over the people when you are witnesses to the people
he is your master an excellent protector and excellent is the helper
successful are the believers
who are humble in their prayers
who shun vain conversation
and who are doers of zakah
and those who guard their modesty
except for their wives and their descendants
they are free from their wives and they are free of blame
but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors
and those who keep their trusts and covenants
and who guard their prayers
these are the inheritors
who will inherit paradise therein dwelling forever
we created man of an extraction of clay
then we made him a drop in a receptacle secure
then we made the drop of fluid into a clot then we made the clot into a clot then we created the lump of flesh bones then we made the bones with flesh bones and we made it as a new creation
so blessed be allah the best of creators
then after that you will surely die
then on the day of resurrection you will be raised up
and we have created above you seven paths and we are not unmindful of creation
and we sent down water from the sky in measure and lodged it in the earth and we are able to take it away
then we produced for you therewith gardens of datepalms and grapes and whereof ye eat
and a tree that springeth forth from mount sinai which groweth oil and relish for the eaters
and verily in the cattle is a lesson for you we give you in cattle
and there are much benefits for you from the benefits of which you feed in them and you have many benefits
and of them ye eat
and on them and on ships you are carried
and assuredly we sent nuh unto his people and he said o my people worship allah ye have no god other than him so will ye not fear him
but the notables of his people who disbelieved said this is nothing but a mortal like you
he wishes to acquire ascendancy over you
had allah willed he would have sent down angels
we never heard of this among our forefathers of yore
he is naught but a man possessed
so wait for a while
so you ignore him and he asks
he said “ my lord help me for they have rejected me ”
so we inspired him saying construct the ark under our observation and by our inspiration
until when our command came and the oven boiled upon the earth we said embark therein two of every species and thy family except those who believe
and do not address me concerning those who have done wrong they will be drowned
and when you and those with you are seated in the ark say praise be to allah who has saved us from the wrongdoing people
and say “ my lord cause me to land a blessed landing for you are the best of deliverers ”
verily in that are signs verily we are ever sending
then after them we brought forth another generation
and we sent among them a messenger from themselves saying worship allah
will you not fear him
the notables among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the hereafter and said “ this is nothing but a human being like you ”
how can he make you hear
if you obey a human being like yourselves then you will be losers
does he promise you that when you are dead and become dust and bones you will be brought forth
farfetched farfetched farfetched is what you are promised
there is nothing but our life of this world
we die and we live and we shall not be raised again
he is naught but a man who hath invented a lie against allah and we are not going to believe him
he said my lord vindicate me for they belie me
he said ‘ in a little while they will become regretful ’
so the scream overcame them and we reduced them to a rubble
so away with the wrongdoing lot
then after them we brought forth other generations
no nation outstrips its term nor do they put it back
then we sent our messengers in succession every nation a warner and we made him one of them a liar
so we made a follow one another to enter the truth and so away with the people who are not a people who believe
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a manifest authority
to pharaoh and his council
they were in disturbing the people who believed and were conceited towards the people who were well aware of their faith
they said shall we believe in two men like ourselves while their people are our slaves
so they denied them and became of those who were destroyed
and we gave moses the book that they may be guided
and we made the son of mary and his mother a sign and we gave them refuge in a place of rest
o messengers eat of the good things and do good things i am seeing of what you do
this community of yours is one religion and i am your lord
so fear me
but they split up their religion among themselves into sects each section rejoicing in what it has
so leave them in their stupor till a time
do they think that we enlarge them in wealth and children
nay we hasten unto them good things in reality but they perceive not
indeed those who tremble in fear of their lord
and who believe in the signs of their lord
and those who do not ascribe any partners to their lord
and those who give what they give and their hearts tremble with awe that they will be returned to their lord
these are the ones who race in goodness and outpace them
we task no soul except according to its capacity and with us is a book that speaks the truth and they will not be wronged
nay their hearts are in ignorance of this and they have works beside him so that their works are covered with other works
until when we seize their affluent ones with punishment they begin to groan
do not groan today you will receive no help from us
my verses were recited to you but you turned back on your heels
waxing proud against it talking foolishness in the night
what have they not pondered the word or has not reached them what has come to their forefathers
or is it that they recognised not their messenger and so they deny him
or do they say he is madness in him
nay he brought them the truth but most of them are averse to the truth
and if the truth had followed their desires the heavens and the earth and whosoever is in them would have been corrupted
nay but we have brought them their message but they are disregardful of their reminder
or do you ask them for tribute
and the maintenance of your lord is better
he is the best of providers
and indeed you invite them to a straight path
but those who do not believe in the hereafter are swerving away from the path
and if we had mercy upon them and relieved them from the affliction they would still persist in their insolence wandering blindly
we seized them with punishment but they did not humble themselves to their lord nor did they humbly supplicate
until when we opened upon them a portal of severe punishment they will be plunged in despair
it is he who has made for you the hearing and the eyesight and the feelings
little do you thank
it is he who has spread you on the earth and to him you will be gathered
it is he who gives life and causes death and his is the alternation of night and day
will you not understand
nay but they say the like of what the ancients said
they say when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we be raised up again
we were promised this and our forefathers before us
these are nothing but myths of the ancients
say whose is the earth and whosoever is in it if you should be believers
they will say to allah
say will you not remember
say who is lord of the seven heavens and lord of the splendid throne
they will say “ to god ”
say will you not then fear him
say “ whose is the sovereignty of all things and who protects all things ”
they will say “ to allah ”
say then why are you bewitched
nay but we have brought them the truth and they are liars
there is no god of mary nor has he begotten
had there been any god along with him he would have taken away what it had created and some of them would have risen over others
glory be to allah from all that they ascribe as partner unto him
he knows what is beyond the reach of perception
high be allah exalted above all that they associate with him
say my lord if you should show me what they are promised
my lord put me not among the wrongdoing people
we are able to show you what we promise them
repel evil with what is better
we are well aware of what they allege
and say “ my lord i seek refuge in you from the devils
and i seek refuge in you my lord lest they should attend me
until when death comes to one of them he says “ my lord send me back ”
that i may do right in that i have neglected
by no means
it is a word that he is a barrier until the day when they are dead
so when the trumpet is blown there will be no ties of kinship among them that day nor will they ask one another
then those whose scales are heavy they are the successful
and those whose scales are light those are they who have lost their souls in hell abiding eternally
the fire burneth their faces and they are in it
were not my revelations recited unto you and ye used to deny them
they will say our lord our wretchedness overcame us and we were a people astray
our lord remove us from it and if we will we be wrongdoers
he will say slink away therein and do not speak to me
there were a party of my slaves who said our lord we believe so forgive us and have mercy upon us for you are the best of those who have mercy
but you made them forget to forget until they made you forget my remembrance and you used to laugh at them
i have rewarded them today for their endurance they are the triumphant ”
he will say how long did you stay on earth
they will say we remained a day or part of a day ask those who keep count
he will say you stayed not but little
the life of this world is but a brief enjoyment
do you think that we created you aimlessly and that you will not be returned to us ’
so exalted be allah the true king
there is no god but he the lord of the throne of the glorious throne
and whosoever calleth with allah another god there is no god but he his reckoning is with his lord
the unbelievers will not prosper
and say my lord forgive and have mercy for you are the best of those who show mercy
this is a chapter of the quran and the sunnah and to whom we have sent down
we have sent down clear signs so that you may remember
the adulterer and the adulteress and the adulterer whip
and let not pity for allah and the last day and let you believe in allah and the last day and let them witness the punishment
and let a party of believers witness their punishment
the adulterer marries not except a mushrikah or a mushrikah female polytheist
and the adulterer or the adulterer marries the adulteress none marries her but a mushrikah boy
this is forbidden the believers
those who accuse chaste women and then bring four witnesses scourge them with eighty stripes and do not accept their testimony ever accept their testimony
and these are the transgressors
except those who repent after that and reform — god is allforgiving allmerciful
and those who accuse their wives and their own women but have no witnesses except themselves the testimony of one of them is that he is truthful
and the fifth oath will be that the curse of allah be upon him if he should be of those who lie
but the woman will avert the punishment from her if she bears witness four times by allah that he is a liar
and the fifth testimony that allah s promise ’ is upon her if he is of the truthful
and were it not for allah s grace ’ upon you and his mercy and that allah is the wise the knower
and he is the one who accepts repentance the most merciful
those who spread lies are a band of you do not think it is bad for you
it is good for you
each one of them has earned and he is in his sin
and he who took the major role for him is a terrible punishment
why did you not believing men and believing women when they heard it and said this is a manifest calumny
why did they not bring four witnesses to testify that they have not made charge of it
then since they did not bring the witnesses they are liars in the sight of allah
and had it not been for allah s grace ’ upon you and his mercy in this world and the hereafter a great punishment would have touched you for what you used to fabricate
when you were publishing it with your tongues and uttered with your mouths what you had no knowledge of it
it was a grave offence in the sight of allah
why did you not say when you heard it is not for us to speak of this
o allah
glory be to god this is a mighty calumny
allah advises you lest you should not repeat the like of it if you are believers
and allah expoundeth unto you the revelations
allah is allknowing allwise
those who love that indecency should be broadcast about them and for them is a painful punishment in this world
allah knows and you know not
and were it not for allah s grace ’ upon you and his mercy and that allah is the gentle the merciful
and that it is the word of allah who is ever clement
and whoever follows the footsteps of shaitan satan s doing ’ and does not commit indecent acts ’ s disobedience ’
and were it not for allah s grace ’ upon you and his mercy not one of you would ever have been pure
but allah purifies whomever he wills
allah is hearer knower
and let not those among you who possess dignity and plenty swear not to give the poor and to the needy and to the needy and to the destitute traveler
let them forgive and overlook their failings
do you not love that allah should forgive you
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
indeed those who slander believing women are cursed in this world and in the hereafter
for them is a great punishment
on the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet will testify against them regarding what they used to do
on that day allah will pay them in full their due recompense and they will know that allah is the manifest truth
vicious women are for vicious men and vicious women
good men are for good men and good women
these are absolved of what they say
for them is forgiveness and noble provision
o you who believe do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain the salutation and call for the inhabitants of the city
that is better for you so that you may be mindful
and if you do not find anyone therein enter not until permission has been given you
that is better for you
allah is aware of what you do
there is no fault in you that you enter houses uninhabited wherein there is no sin for you
allah knows what you hide and what you reveal
say to the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their private parts
that is purer for them and allah is aware of what they do
and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and to guard their privates and not to draw their adornment except that which is apparent of their husbands fathers or their husbands fathers or their husbands fathers their husbands sons or their husbands or their husbands fathers their brothers
o you who believe
and turn to allah o believers o you will succeed
marry those of you who are single and the male and female
if they are poor allah will enrich them of his bounty and allah is allbounteous allknowing
and let those who find not means to marry abstain from marriage until allah enriches them of his bounty
and those who seek your freedom from emancipation emancipation know well if you know that some good in them give them of the wealth of allah which he has bestowed upon you
do not force your slavegirls to prostitution if they desire chastity the materials of this world
and whosoever compels them after that he is the most merciful of them
but if they desire to please you then take them in their compulsion
we have sent down to you clarifying verses and a clear example for those who passed away before you
allah is the light of the heavens and the earth
the example of his light is that of a pillar within which is within a lamp is in the glass the glass
the glass is like a brilliant planet fueled neither eastern nor western
its oil would almost almost <unk> fire
light upon light
allah guideth unto his light whom he will
allah speaketh the parables for mankind
allah is knower indulgent
in houses which allah has allowed to be raised and his name to be commemorated therein glorifying him therein and evening
and those who trade not from trade nor trade distracts from the remembrance of allah and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and zakat
they fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned from the horror of the day of resurrection
that allah may reward them for their best deeds and increase them from his bounty and allah provides for whomever he wills without reckoning
as for those who disbelieve their works are like a mirage in the wilderness when it comes to a rock with which he found it a thirsty shaking
he will be repaid for it with allah only he will repay his account
and allah is swift in reckoning
or like darkness on a deep sea covered with a wave covered by a wave covered by a wave covered by clouds which is covered by darkness piled up and some of them are covered with darkness
when he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it
and he whom allah has not granted any light for him
have you not seen that allah is exalted in the heavens and the earth and the birds and the birds with wings spread
each one knows its prayer and its extolling and allah knows all what they do
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and to him is the destination
have you not seen how allah drives clouds then brings them together then piles them into a heap of gold and then you see rain drops emerging rain from it
and he sends down from the sky hail from the sky and he sends down hail from the sky hail and averts it from whomever he wills
the flash of its lightening almost snatches away the sight
allah alternates the night and the day
indeed in that is a lesson for those who have insight
allah has created every moving creature from water and some of them are two feet that walk on two legs and some of them walk on four
allah creates whatever he wills
indeed allah is over all things competent
we have sent down revelations illuminating
allah guides whom he wills to a straight path
they say we believe in allah and the messenger and we obey but a party of them turn away after that
and those are not believers
and when they are called to allah and his messenger to judge between them a party of them turns away
but if the right is theirs they come to him submissively
is there a disease in their hearts
or do they fear that allah and his messenger will be unjust to them
they are the wrongdoers
the only answer of allah and his messenger when they are called to judge between them is that they say we hear and we obey
and such are the successful
and whosoever obeys allah and his messenger and fears allah and fears allah and keeps his duty to him such are the successful
they swear by allah with solemn oaths that if you commanded them they will surely march forth
say do not swear obedience is better for you
say obey allah and obey the messenger
if you turn away then know that it is for him only that he has sent down upon you and upon you rests what you have been charged
if you obey him you will be guided
the messenger is only responsible for the responsibility
allah has promised those of you who believe and do good deeds that he will make them successors in the earth as he will surely establish their religion for them and will establish worship after their religion and will be godfearing for them and will make them successors after
then whosoever altereth it the evilliving folk
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and obey the messenger muhammad saw that you may receive mercy
do not think that the disbelievers can escape from their lord
their refuge is hell and what an evil destination
o you who believe let your dependants and those who have not attained puberty ask permission of you before the dawn prayer and when you disrobe in the early dawn prayer and when you disrobe for prayer
these are three occasions of privacy for you
there is no fault in you or apart from one another
thus allah makes clear his ayat commandments and allah is allknowing allwise
and when your children reach puberty let them ask permission for permission to offer them
thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations
allah is allknowing allwise
as for women past childbearing who have no hope of marriage there is no fault in them nor do they flaunt their adornment
but to refrain is better for them
allah is hearer knower
there is no fault in the blind nor any fault in the lame nor any fault in the sick nor on the sick nor the houses of your brothers houses of your brothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of
no fault in you whether you eat together or separately
when you enter houses greet one another with a greeting from allah blessed and good news for you so that you may take admonition
the believers are only those who believe in god and his messenger and when they are with him they do not depart until they go back to him
those who ask your permission those are they who believe in allah and his messenger
so if they ask you to give them permission to whom you will give permission to whomever he wills and ask forgiveness for them
indeed allah is allforgiving allmerciful
do not make the messenger among yourselves like your calling one another to the call of allah those who slip away from among you who abuse the messenger of allah lest they should say ‘ o allah ’ s messenger ’ is severe and let them beware of allah
lo unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
he knows what you are doing
he will tell them what they used to do
allah is knower indulgent
blessed is he who sent down the criterion of right guidance and a warner to his votary that he may be a warner to all the worlds
to him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he has no son
he created everything and has measured it exactly
and they have taken besides him gods who create nothing and themselves are created and possess not hurt or benefit or benefit or hurt or profit themselves
the unbelievers say this is nothing but a calumny he has concocted and he has helped him so they have helped him
they say tales of the ancients which he has written down so they are recited to him morning and evening
say he has sent it down by the knower of the heavens and the earth surely he is allforgiving allcompassionate
and they say what sort of messenger is this who eats food and walks in the markets
why has not an angel been sent down to him prophet muhammad saw as a warner and a warner with him
or why has not a treasure been given to him or why has he not been given a garden from which he eats
and the wrongdoers say you follow only a man bewitched
see how they coin examples for you
they have gone astray so they can not find a way
blessed is he who if he wills will assign you better than that gardens beneath which rivers flow and will assign for you palaces
nay they belie the hour and we have prepared for those who deny the hour a blaze
when it beholdeth them from afar they hear it raging and roaring
and when they are flung into a narrow place thereof chained together they will exclaim
they will be told ‘ do not pray for one death today ’
say is this better or the garden of eternity which is promised to those who ward off evil and their refuge will be the fire
for them there is whatever they desire and they will abide therein eternally
this is a promise binding upon your lord
on the day when he will muster them and those whom they worship besides allah will say did you mislead these servants or did they themselves stray from the way
they will say glory be to thee
it was not for us to take other gods besides you
but you gave them enjoyments and their ancestors until they forgot the reminder and became a people doomed
so they deny your own souls
so you can neither avert from you nor can they help
and whoever of you does wrong we shall make him taste a dreadful punishment
and we did not send before you any messengers but they ate food and walked in the marketplaces
and we made you a <unk> of joseph
and we have made some of you a trial for others so that you may be patient
and thy lord is ever watchful
those who do not expect to meet us say why do not the angels sent down to us or why were we not see our lord
they have thought of god and have become arrogant within their insolence
the day when they will see the angels there will be no glad tidings for the sinners
they will say “ and they will be told “ ”
then we will turn to dust floating and will turn to dust floating particles of dust
the inhabitants of paradise on that day will be better lodged in the best abode and a good resting place
and on the day when the heaven is split asunder with clouds and the angels are sent down with clouds
the sovereignty on that day belongs to the most merciful and that day will be a hard day for the disbelievers
the day when the wrongdoer will bite his hands and say would that i had taken the messenger s way
woe to me
would that i had never taken soandso as a friend
he had led me astray from the remembrance after it had come to me
satan is indeed a deserter to man
and the messenger will say my lord my people have taken this qur an as a mockery
thus we have made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners
and sufficient is your lord as a guide and helper
and those who disbelieve say why is the qur an not revealed to him all at once
thus we revealed it to you in stages that you may strengthen your heart thereby and we have recited it in stages
and they come to you with a parable but we bring you the truth and better in explanation
those who will be gathered to hell upon their faces those are the worst in position and farthest astray in repentance
we gave moses the book and appointed his brother aaron as his assistant
then we said go both of you to the people who have denied our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
then we annihilated them completely
and the people of noah when they denied the messengers we drowned them and made them a sign for mankind
we have prepared a painful punishment for the wrongdoers
and ad and thamud and the people of rass and the last and many generations between them
and we presented examples to each of them and each we ruined them
and they have passed away before that which was rained on a height
did they not see it – so they are returned to it – it is not seen the former creation
nay but they expect not resurrection
and when they see you they take you for mockery is this the one whom allah has sent as a messenger
he would have misled us from our gods if we had not been staunch to them
soon they will know when they see the punishment who is further astray from the path
have you seen him who takes his lust as his god his protector you will be a guardian over him
or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand
they are like cattle nay they are further astray from the path
have you not seen how your lord lengthens out the shadow
then we made the sun its pilot
then we withdraw it towards us gradually
it is he who made the night a covering for you and sleep repose and makes the day a resurrection
and it is he who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings before his mercy and we send down from the sky water pure
that we may revive a dead land and give drink to drink of which we have created
and we distribute it among them that they may be reminded
yet most people do not know except disbelief
had we willed we could have raised up a warner in every village
so do not obey the faithless but wage jihad against them with it a great striving
and it is he who has released simultaneously the two seas one palatable and sweet and he has set a barrier between them and a barrier between them is a barrier and a partition between them
and it is he who created man from water then from him who has created him and made him kindred by blood and marriage
your lord is omnipotent
and they worship besides allah that which can neither benefit them nor harm them
the unbeliever is always an auxiliary against his lord
and we have sent you only as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
say i ask of you no wage for this except that he should take the way of his lord
and trust in allah who dieth not the living one who dieth and glorify him with praise
he suffices as his servants
who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he established himself above the throne
the merciful ask about him who has informed about his throne
and when it is said to them prostrate yourselves to the most merciful they say and what is the most merciful
shall we prostrate ourselves to whatever you bid us ’
and it increases them in aversion
blessed is he who has placed in the sky constellations in the sky and has set in it a lamp and a moon giving light
it is he who created the alternation of night and day and makes the day alternate for him who desires to remember
the servants of the allbeneficent are those who walk on the earth modestly and when the ignorant address them they say peace
and who spend the night prostrate themselves before their lord and standing
and who say our lord avert from us the torment of hell for its torment is indeed continuous
it is an evil halt and an evil abode
and those who when they spend are neither prodigal nor miserly that is between the two extremes
and those who call upon another god along with god and do not kill any soul which god has forbidden except by god and do not fornicate and whoever does this will be punished
multiplied for him is the punishment of the day of resurrection and he will abide therein humiliated
except those who repent and believe and do good deeds allah will change their evil deeds and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
and whosoever repents and does good deeds he turns to allah with repentance
and those who do not bear witness and when they pass by idle talk pass by with dignity
and those who when they are reminded of the revelations of their lord fall not deaf and blind thereat
and those who say our lord grant us comfort of comfort and make us leaders for the godfearing
those will be awarded the chamber for their patience and they will be greeted with greetings of peace and salutations
they will abide therein and it is an excellent residence
say “ my lord pays attention to you if you do not give the lie to your invocation
so now you will be awarded what you used to give ”
ta sin mim
these are the verses of the manifest book
perhaps you will kill yourself with grief because they are not believers
if we will we can send down upon them a sign from the sky so their necks will be humbled to it
no fresh reminder comes to them from the most merciful but they turn away from it
they denied the truth
and there will come to you the tidings of what they used to deride
have they not seen the earth how many we have caused to grow in it every generous kind
surely in that is a sign for a people who have no faith
but most of them do not believe
your lord is the almighty the merciful
and remember when your lord called musa moses saying go to the harmdoing nation
the people of pharaoh will they not fear
he said my lord i fear they will deny me
and my breast straitens and my tongue will not be fluent so endow messengership for aaron
and they have a charge against me so i fear they will kill me
he said no
go both of you with our signs we shall be with you listening
go to pharaoh and say ‘ to him ‘ we are the messengers of the lord of the worlds
let the children of israel go with us
he said did we not rear you among us when you remained among us a child
and you committed that you committed many years and your life of yours were ungrateful
you are one of the ingrates
he said “ i did it then when i was mistaken ”
so i fled from you when i feared you and my lord bestowed upon me wisdom and made me one of the messengers
and that you have enslaved the children of israel you have enslaved me with which you have enslaved the children of israel
pharaoh said and what is the lord of the worlds
moses said the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you should be believers
pharaoh said to those around him do you hear
he said your lord and the lord of your fathers the ancients
pharaoh said ‘ indeed your messenger who has been sent to you is crazy ’
he said lord of the east and the west and all that is between them if you but understand
pharaoh said if you take a god other than me i will surely make you one of the prisoners
he said even though i bring you something manifest
pharaoh said then bring it if you are of the truthful
so moses threw his staff and lo it became a serpent manifest
and he drew out his hand and lo it was white to the onlookers
pharaoh said to the nobles around him “ this is indeed a skilled magician ”
who seeks to expel you from your land by his magic
what do you advise ”
they said put him off and his brother and send callers to the cities callers
to bring you every expert magician ’
so the magicians were assembled at a fixed time on a particular the day of the battle
and it was said unto the people are ye going to assemble
we may follow the magicians if they are the winners
and when the magicians arrived they said to pharaoh will there be a reward for us if we are the winners
he said yes and you will then become among those brought near to me
moses said to them cast whatever you intend to throw
so they threw down their cords and their staves and said by the might of fir aun pharaoh we shall be the winners
then moses threw his staff and lo it swallowed up their lying invention
so the magicians fell down prostrate
they said we believe in the lord of the worlds
the lord of moses and aaron
pharaoh said you accepted faith in him before i gave you permission indeed he is your chief who taught you magic
soon you will know
i will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and i will crucify you all
they said no harm surely unto our lord we shall return
we hope that our lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers
then we revealed to moses saying go with my servants by night for you shall be pursued
then pharaoh sent heralds to the cities
proclaiming these are a small band
and they have enraged us
and we are a host on guard
so we expelled them from gardens and springs
treasures and stately homes
so it was and we bequeathed them to the children of israel
then they pursued them at sunrise
and when the two hosts sighted each other the companions of moses said we are overtaken
he said no indeed it is with me that i should show me the way
we inspired moses saying smite the sea with your staff
so it parted and each part was like a huge hill
and we brought the others close to that place
and we saved moses and those with him all together
then we drowned the others
surely in that is a sign but most of them do not believe
and verily your lord is the mighty the merciful
and recite to them the story of abraham
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
they said we worship idols and continue cleaving to them
he said do they hear you when you call them
or do they benefit you or harm you ”
they said no but we found our fathers doing so
he said have you considered what you have been worshipping
you and your ancient fathers
they are enemies to me except the lord of the worlds
who created me and he guides me
and who feedeth me and watereth me
and who heals me
who will cause me to die and then will bring me to life
and who i hope will forgive me my sins on the day of recompense
my lord grant me wisdom and join me with the righteous
and appoint me a tongue of truthfulness among posterity
and place me among the inheritors of the garden of bliss
and forgive my father
he is of the astray
and do not disgrace me on the day when they are raised
the day when neither wealth nor children will avail
except him who comes to allah with a sound heart
and paradise will be brought near for the cautious
and hell will be brought near to the perverse
and it will be said to them where are you used to worship
other than allah
can they help you
or do they have a want to help us ”
then they will be pitched into it they and the perverse
and the hosts of iblis together
they will say while they dispute therein
by allah we were in clear error
when we made you equal with the lord of the worlds
no one misled us except the sinners
now we have no intercessors
nor a close friend
if only we could return to the world we would be among the believers
surely in that is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord is the mighty the merciful
the people of noah impugned the apostles
when their brother noah said to them will you not fear allah
i am a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for it
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
so fear allah and obey me
they said shall we believe in you when it is said to you who will follow you
he said what knowledge have i of what they have been doing
their account falls only upon my lord if you but knew
and i am not one to drive away the believers
i am only a plain warner ”
they said if you do not desist you will surely be among those stoned to death
he said my lord my people have denied me
so judge conclusively between me and them and deliver me and the believers who are with me
so we saved him and those with him in the laden ship
then we drowned the rest
surely in that is a sign yet most of them do not believe
and verily your lord is the mighty the merciful
the ad gave the lie to the messengers
when their brother hud said to them will you not fear allah
i am a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for it
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
do you build a monument on every prominence
and take you that you may be immortal therein
and when you strike you strike you strike mercilessly
so fear allah and obey me
and fear him who has aided you with what you know
he has aided you with livestock and children
gardens and fountains
i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
they said it is the same to us whether you admonish us or art not of those who preach
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
and we will not be punished
so they impugned him and we destroyed them indeed in that is a sign but most of them do not believe
and verily your lord is the mighty the merciful
the tribe of thamud denied the messengers
when their brother salih said to them will you not fear allah
i am a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for it
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
will you be left secure in this
in gardens and springs
and tilled fields and palmtrees with slender spathes
and you skillfully carve houses in the mountains
so fear allah and obey me
and do not follow the way of the extravagant
who spread corruption in the land and do not amend
they said you are but one of those bewitched
you are nothing but a man like us
so bring us a sign if you are of the truthful
he said “ this is a shecamel
she has a right to her drink and do not be a drink of the day you are set free for her
and touch her not with evil lest the punishment of a dreadful day seizes you
but they hamstrung her and then regretted and became regretful
so the punishment overtook them
surely in that is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord is the mighty the merciful
the people of lot impugned the apostles
when their brother lot said to them will you not fear allah
i am a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for it
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
what do you approach the males of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
leaving the consorts your lord has created for you
nay but ye are a trespassing people
they said if you do not desist you will surely be expelled
he said i am of those who abhor your faith
my lord save me and my family from their deeds
so we saved him and his family all
except an old woman who remained behind
then we destroyed the others
and we rained down upon them a rain of stones
dreadful is the rain of those forewarned
surely in that is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord is the mighty the merciful
the dwellers of the wood belied the messengers
when shuaib said to them will you not fear
i am a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for it
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
give full measure and do not be of those who reduce
weigh with an even balance
and defraud not the people of their goods and do not act corruptly making mischief in the land
and fear him who created you and the former generations
they said you are but one of those bewitched
you are just a human being like us
we are indeed lying
then bring down a fragment of heaven if you are truthful
he said my lord knows best what you do
so they denied him so the punishment of the day of shadow of shadow black smoke
it was the chastisement of a dreadful day
surely in that is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and verily your lord is the mighty the merciful
and verily this qur an is a revelation from the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
the trustworthy spirit has brought it down
upon your heart that you may be one of the warners
in plain arabic language
and indeed it is in the scriptures of the ancients
is it not a sign for them that the learned of israel knew
had we revealed it to one of the foreigners
and he had recited it to them they would not have believed in it
thus do we make it traverse the hearts of the guilty
they will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment
so it will come upon them suddenly while they perceive it not
then they will say shall we be respited
do they want to hasten our punishment
have you considered if we let them enjoy for years
then there comes upon them that which they were promised
how will they be given enjoyment of the life of the world
and we never destroyed a city but it had warners
for a reminder and we never harmed
the devils did not bring it down
it is not suitable for them
they can not have done it nor can they have done
indeed they are banished from hearing
so invoke not with allah another deity lest you be one of those who are punished
and warn your closest relatives
and lower your wing to those who follow you
and if they disobey you say i am quit of what you do
and put your trust in the mighty the merciful
who sees you when you rise up
and your movements among those who fall prostrate
he is the hearer the knower
shall i tell you on whom the satans descend
they descend on every sinful liar
they listen but most of them are liars
as for the poets only the deviators follow them
have you not seen how they wander in every valley
and they say what they do not do
except those who believe and do good deeds and remember allah and vindicate themselves after they had been wronged and they will come to know what overturning they will be overturned
ta sin
these are the verses of the qur an and a clear book
a guidance and good tidings for the believers
who establish prayer and give zakah and are certain of the hereafter
as for those who do not believe in the hereafter we have made their deeds seem decorous to them so they wander bewildered
these are they for whom is a terrible punishment and they are the greatest losers in the hereafter
indeed you are receiving the qur an ’ allknowing
and remember when musa moses said to his family i see a fire i will bring you news from it or bring you news of a burning firebrand so that you may warm yourselves
but when he came to it he was called blessed is he who is in the fire and whosoever is in it
glory be to god the lord of all the worlds
o moses it is i allah the almighty the wise
and cast down thy staff
and when he saw it quivering like a serpent he turned not back and turned about in retreat
o moses approach and have no fear
the messengers fear not in front of me
except for him who has committed wrong against himself
but whoever repents after goodness has been gracious to me i am indeed forgiving and merciful
put your hand inside your collar and your robe it will come out luminous from pharaoh and his people
they are a wicked people
but when our enlightening signs came to them visibly they said this is obvious magic
they denied them though their souls acknowledged them wrongfully and they believed in their pride
so see what sort of fate befell the agents of corruption
and we gave david and solomon knowledge and many of them
they said all praise unto allah who hath preferred us above his believing slaves
and solomon inherited david s heir ’ and said “ o people we have been taught the language of birds and we have been given of everything
this is indeed a clear grace ’
and gathered together to sulaiman of jinns and men and birds and they were set in battle
until when they came to the valley of ants an ant said ants enter your houses lest solomon and his hosts crush you while they perceive not
so he smiled amused at her speech and said my lord arouse me in favour wherewith thou hast bestowed upon me and my parents and thy offspring and to give thanks for thy blessing which thou hast favoured me and work righteously and work righteousness that i may work
admit me by your mercy among your righteous servants
and he reviewed the birds and said why do i not see the hoopoe
or is he absent ’
i will punish him severely or he will punish me with a terrible seizing
but he remained not long for long while he was in coming and said i know what you have not been given
i come to you with certain news
i found a woman ruling over them and she has been given everything and she has a mighty throne
i found her and her people worshiping the sun instead of allah
satan made their deeds seem fair to them and diverted them from the path so they are not guided
so that they do not prostrate themselves to allah who brings forth the hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you hide
allah la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he the lord of the great throne
he said we will see whether you have spoken the truth or are one of those who say is true
go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them and then draw aside from them and see what answer they return
she said o council verily there hath been delivered unto me a noble letter
it is from sulaiman solomon and it is said to allah the most merciful of the merciful
do not rise up against me but come to me in surrender muslims
she said o chiefs counsel me concerning my affair
i do not decide any matter until you are present with me ’
they said we are possessors of force and command it is for you to command so consider what you will command
she said verily kings when they enter a township they enter a city despoil the village and despoil the honour of its people
thus they do
i will send them a gift and see what the envoys bring back
so when the messengers came to solomon he said “ are you helping me with wealth
but what allah has given me is better than what he has given you but you are delighted
go back to them and we will come upon them with hosts which they will come to pass and we will expel them from there in disgrace and degraded
he said o council which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in surrender
a stalwart of the jinn said i will bring it before you rise from your place
i am strong and reliable enough for him who is worthy of determination
he said i will bring it before you who will bring it back to you
then when he saw it settled before him he said this is of the grace of my lord that he may test me whether i am grateful or ungrateful
whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for his own soul and whosoever is ungrateful only for his own good
but whosoever is ungrateful then verily he is owner of mercy and he is the owner of mercy
he said disguise her throne for her and we see whether she is guided or be of those who are not guided
so when she arrived it was said to her is your throne like this
she said it is as if it were a boy
and sulaiman solomon said it was said to him we were given knowledge before her and we were muslims
and that which she used to worship other than allah was prevented from the idols for she was a people who were unbelievers
it was said to her enter the palace
so when she saw it she thought it was a thought that thought
he said “ my lord is a palace paved with crystal ”
she said “ my lord i have wronged myself and i submit with solomon to allah the lord of the worlds ”
and indeed we sent to thamud their brother salih saleh who lived at ease on their own company as they were two parties
he said o my people why do you seek to hasten evil rather than good
why do you not ask forgiveness of allah that you may receive mercy
they said we augur ill of you and those who are with you
he said “ your evil augury is with allah ”
nay but you are a people being tested
and there were in the city nine persons who spread corruption in the land and did not act corruptly in the land
they said swear to one another by allah that we will attack him and his family at night and his family and then we will not say to his family we will be witnesses at the destruction of his family and we were truthful
they plotted a plot and we planned a plan while they perceived not
so see how was the outcome of their plotting we destroyed them and their people all together
so their houses became desolate because of their iniquities
surely in that is a sign for a people who know
and we saved those who believed and were godfearing
and lot when he said to his people “ do you commit immorality while you commit open
do you approach men lustfully instead of women
nay but ye are a people addicted to ignorant ways
but the only answer of his people was only that they said expel the family of lot from your city they are people who are pure
so we saved him and his family except his wife we destined her to stay behind
and we rained down upon them a rain of stones
dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned
say all praise be to god
peace be upon you the word of allah
or is he better or what they associate with him
is not he best who created the heavens and the earth and sends down water from the sky and thereby caused to grow therewith gardens of beauty whose trees you could never grow up
is there a deity with allah
nay but they are a people who ascribe equals to him
is not he best who made the earth a fixed abode and placed rivers in it and placed mountains as anchors in it and placed mountains between the two seas
is there a god besides allah
nay but most of them know not
is he better or he who answereth the distressed when he calls upon him and removes the evil and appoints you to spread corruption in the earth
is there a god besides allah
little do you reflect
is it not he who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea and sends the winds bearing good tidings before his mercy
is there a god besides allah
high be allah exalted above all that they associate with him
or he who initiates the creation and then repeats it and who provides you sustenance from the sky
is there a god along with allah
say bring your proof if you are truthful
say none in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except allah and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected
nay but they are in doubt about the hereafter
and those who disbelieve say when we and our fathers have become dust shall we then be brought forth again
we were promised this we and our fathers before
this is nothing but the tales of the ancients
say travel in the land and see how was the end of the sinners
and grieve not for them nor be straitened because of what they plot
and they say when will this promise come if you are truthful
say “ perhaps some of what you seek to hasten is part behind ”
indeed your lord is gracious to mankind but most of them do not give thanks
indeed your lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal
no thing is there in the heaven and earth but it is recorded in a clear book
indeed this quran narrates to the children of israel most of what they differ
and it is a guidance and mercy for the believers
verily your lord will decide between them by his judgement
and he is the mighty the knower
so put your trust in god you are on the clear truth
you can not make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs
nor can you guide the blind out of their error
you can make none hear except those who believe in our verses and have submitted
and when the word of the fulfilment of the word falls upon them we shall bring out for them a beast of the earth speaking to them “ do not believe in our signs ”
the day when we shall gather from every nation a group of those who denied our signs and they will be held in check
until when they come he will say did you deny my ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc you have not denied them
what was it that you used to do ’
and the word of punishment will come upon them because of what they used to wrong
they will not speak
have they not seen how we made the night to appear to rest and the day to see
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and remind them of the day when the trumpet is blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth will be terrified except him whom allah wills and all will come to him humbled
and you see the mountains and think they will pass away as you think they are scattered
that is the handiwork of allah who perfected everything
he is aware of what you do
whoever brings a good deed will have better than it
on that day they will be secure from the mighty day
and whosoever comes with evil their lord will be flung down into the fire
will you then be rewarded for what you used to do
say i have been commanded to serve the lord of this city which he has commanded to be pure and i am commanded to be one of those who surrender to him
and to recite the qur an
and whosoever goeth right goeth right only for his own soul and whosoever goes astray say i am only a warner
and say i am only a warner
and say all praise belongs to allah
he will show you his signs and you will recognize them
your lord is not unaware of what you do
ta sin mim
these are the verses of the clear book
we narrate to you with the history of moses and pharaoh for a people who believe
indeed pharaoh tyrannized in the land and made its people sects weakening oppressing a group of them slaughtering their newborn sons and sparing their women
he was one of the mischiefmakers
we wanted to show favour those who were weak in the land and to make them leaders and inheritors
and to establish them in the land and to show pharaoh and haman and their hosts that which they dreaded
and we inspired the mother of musa moses saying suckle him when you cast him into the river
and do not fear for him fear and fear
we will make him one of our messengers and we will restore him to you
then the household of fir awn picked him up that he might be picked up the pharaoh s family and haman and their hosts were habitual guilty of pharaoh and haman and their hosts were habitual sinners
and the wife of fir awn said unto him and unto thee and unto thee and unto thee
do not kill him
peradventure he may benefit us or we may adopt him as a son
and they perceived not
the heart of moses mother became empty of moses
she was about to disclose that we had strengthened her heart she said ‘ we had not strengthened her heart ’
she said to his sister follow him
so she said who watched him from a distance while they perceived not
we had forbidden to moses before made wet nurse
so moses said shall i tell you a household who will rear him while they will be a guardian of his family
thus we restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve and know that allah s promise ’ is true but most of them do not know
and when he attained his full strength and was mentally mature we bestowed upon him judgment and knowledge
thus do we reward the doers of good
and he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its people and he found therein two men fighting one of his caste and he found one of his caste fighting in it and he was a wali friend
and the man who belonged to his party appealed for help against him
so moses struck him with his fist and finished him off
he said “ this is an enemy of satan he is an enemy to the erring people ”
he said my lord i have wronged myself so forgive me
so forgive me
indeed he is the allforgiving the allmerciful
he said my lord forasmuch as you have favored me i will never be a helper for the oppressors
and he became fearful of the city when in the morning he had asked his help
so he who cried out to his help appealed for help
moses said you are a clear sign for you
and when he wanted to seize him and he was an enemy to both of them he said o moses do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday
you only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be one of the ignorant
and a man came running from the farthest end of the city he said “ i am conspiring to kill you ”
so he left fearful and vigilant he said my lord deliver me from the harmdoing nation
and when he turned his face towards midian he said maybe my lord will guide me to the sound way
and when he arrived at the water of madyan he found there a crowd of people watering their flocks and he found apart from them two women holding back their flocks
he said what is your circumstance
they said we can not water until the shepherds dispatch their flocks and our father is an old man
so he watered their flock for them and then he turned away from the shade and said my lord i have need of whatever good you may send down for me
then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully
so when he said to his father ‘ you have said ‘ my father is a reward for him who has delivered you from the house of firaun and forgave him
you have escaped from the wrongdoing people
one of the two women said “ o my father is the best employee for you is the strong the trustworthy ”
he said “ i wish to marry you to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you o my father if you wish to be one of the other to me for eight years
i do not intend to impose any hardship on you
you will find me if allah wills of the righteous
he said “ so be between me and you whichever of me whichever of you i fulfill it and i am commanded to be victorious ”
and when moses had completed the term and departed with his family he noticed a fire on the side of the mount sinai
he said to his family stay here i have glimpsed a fire
i am not a fire
maybe i will bring you news from it or a brand of fire that you may warm yourselves
then when he came to it he was called from the right side of the valley in the blessed spot from the tree he said o moses verily i am allah the lord of the worlds
and throw down your staff
and when he saw it quivering like a serpent he turned not back and turned about in retreat
o moses
o moses approach and fear not
put your hand inside your hand to your neck and come out shining without blemish it will come out white without any blemish and draw them close to you from your lord to the pharaoh s clan ’ and his council are indeed a guilty lot ’
he said my lord i have killed a man of them and i fear they will kill me
my brother aaron is more eloquent than me
so send him with me as a helper for me i fear that they will deny me
he said we will strengthen your arm with your brother and we will grant you authority so they will not be able to harm you
you and those who follow you will be the victors
so when moses came to them with our manifest signs they said this is nothing but magic
we never heard of this among our forefathers of yore
moses said my lord knows best who brings guidance from him and whose end is the best residence
the wrongdoers will not prosper
pharaoh said o chiefs i know not that you have any god other than me so kindle me a fire for me for i think that you may mount up clay and build a tower above me
he and his hosts unduly acted arrogantly in the land without right and they thought that they would never be returned to us
so we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea
so see how was the end of the wrongdoers
and we made them leaders calling to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
and we made a curse in this world and we made a curse to follow them on the day of resurrection
and we gave moses the book after we had destroyed the former generations as a guidance and a mercy to the people of old that they may remember
you were not a jew to mount sinai when we revealed to moses the commandment and you were not among the witnesses
and we raised many generations after moses and prolonged long for them and you were not a dweller among the people of madyan reciting to them our verses but we were sending messengers
and you were not a wonder to the side of the mount when we called it to moses but you were a mercy from your lord so that you may warn a people who do not warn their people
and if a calamity befell them because of what their hands have sent ahead they said our lord why did you not send a messenger to us that we might follow your revelations and so be among the believers
but when the truth from us came to them they said why has he not been given moses though they did not believe in what was given to moses
they said “ two magicians are different groups ” and they said “ each helping us ” and they said “ we disbelieve in both of moosa and his noble messengers ”
say then bring a book from allah which is better than these if you are truthful
but if they do not respond to you know that they follow their fancies
and who is more astray than one who follows his lust without guidance from allah
indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
and we have caused the word to be upon them that they may remember
those to whom we gave the book before it believe in it
and when it is recited to them they say we believe in it
it is the truth from our lord
we were even before it even before it they were devoted to him
these will be given their reward twice over because they repel evil with good and spend of what we have provided them
and when they hear idle talk they withdraw from it and say to us our deeds and to you your deeds
peace be unto you
we do not desire the ignorant
you can not guide whomever you will but god guides whomever he wills and he knows best those who are rightly guided
they say if we follow the guidance with you we will be snatched away from our land
have we not established for them a sanctuary sanctuary whereunto are brought to all kinds of fruits which are brought from us
but most of them do not know
how many a city we have destroyed that had destroyed that had been thankless
and yonder are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except a little
and we were the inheritors
and never would your lord destroy the cities until he had sent down to their mother town a messenger reciting to them our verses
and we did not destroy the cities unless their people were wrongdoers
whatever you have been given is a provision of the life of this world and its glitter and its adornment
will you not understand
is he whom we have promised a fair promise which he will receive like him whom we have given the enjoyment of the life of this world and then he will be brought back to the fire
on the day when he will call to them and say where are my partners whom you used to assert
those against whom the word of punishment will say our lord these are they whom we seduced by us we seduced astray ourselves were not serving thee we ourselves erred
and it will be said call upon your associategods
they will call upon them but they will not respond to them
they will call upon them and they will see the chastisement wishing they had followed guidance
on the day when he will call to them and say what answer gave you to the messengers
on that day the news will be darkened for them and they will not ask one another
but as for him who repents and believes and does good deeds he will be among the successful
your lord creates whatever he wills and restricts it
hallowed be he and exalted above that which they associate
glory be to god and exalted be he above all that they associate
your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they reveal
and he is allah there is no god but he his is the praise in the former and the latter and unto him you shall be returned
say tell me should allah make the night perpetual for you till the day of resurrection what allah allah has appointed for you till the day of resurrection which allah other than allah can bring you light
will you not hear
say tell me should allah make the day perpetual for you till the day of resurrection what allah will bring you night wherein you can rest then can you not see
and by his mercy he has appointed for you night and day that you may rest therein and seek his bounty and that you may give thanks
on the day when he will call to them and say where are my partners whom you used to assert
and we shall draw out from every nation a witness and say bring your proof
then they will know that the truth is with allah and the lies they invented will forsake them
korah was one of moses people s people ’
and we gave him treasures of the children of moses treasures that their keys would have been strong and children of strong men
his people said to him do not exult god does not love the exultant
seek to seek the means of the hereafter with which allah has given you your share in this world and do not forget your share in the land and do not forget your share of corruption in the earth indeed allah does not like the agents of corruption
he said i have been given this in knowledge i have been given by permission of allah
did he not know that allah had destroyed before him generations of power and more wealth than him in wealth and children
the sinners will not be questioned about their sins
so he went forth before his people in his pomp ask the like of what he had spent
he is indeed a mighty fortune
but those who were given knowledge said woe to you
the reward of allah is better for those who believe and do good
but none attains it except the steadfast and the steadfast
so we caused the earth to swallow him and his dwellingplace and he found no host to help him against allah nor was he able to help him
and morning found his position in the morning had been decreed for him who had stayed in his state saying ah we had never lived before
allah enlargeth the provision for whom he will of his bondmen and straiteneth it for whom he will
had allah not been gracious to us he would have caused the earth to swallow us
ah the unbelievers do not prosper
that home of the hereafter we assign it unto those who desire not exorbitance in the earth nor corruption
the sequel is for the cautious
whoever brings a good deed will receive better than it and whoever brings evil deeds will have the consequence of what he has done and they will not be wronged
he who has obligated the qur an ’ upon you will bring you back to the place of return
say my lord knows best who comes with guidance and who is in manifest error
you did not expect to be transmitted to the book that the quran would be sent down to you except that it is a mercy from your lord so do not be a supporter of the faithless
and let not those who disbelieve in what has been revealed to you from the verses of allah after they have been revealed to you
and call thou thy lord and be thou not of the idolaters
and invoke not any other god along with allah
there is no god but he
all judgement belongs to him and to him you will be returned
his is the judgement and to him you will be returned
alif lam meem
do people think that they will be left alone because they say we believe and will not be tested
we have tested those who were before them and allah knows those who have gone before them and he will surely test the liars
or do they think that they will outstrip us
evil is what they judge
whoever expects to encounter god let him know that god s reckoning ’ is coming
allah is hearer knower
whosoever strives strives strives only for himself
allah is independent of the worlds
those who believe and do good deeds we will remit from them their sins and we will reward them according to the best of what they used to do
we have enjoined upon man goodness to his parents
but if they urge you to associate with me that you associate with me something which you have no knowledge then do not obey them
to me is your return and i will inform you of what you used to do
and those who believe and do good works we shall admit them among the righteous
and among men there are some who say we believe in allah but when he is harmed in allah s cause he turns to the people who do not help the people as if they were earning
and if victory comes from your lord they say we were with you
does allah not know what is in the breasts of men
allah will surely ascertain those who believe and he will surely ascertain the hypocrites
the faithless say to the believers follow our way and follow us
“ and carry your oaths ”
they will not bear anything of their iniquities
they are liars
they will carry their own loads and other loads besides their own loads and other loads along with the burdens of those who were laden with their own burdens
they will be questioned about what they used to do
and we sent noah to his people and he lived among them a thousand years minus fifty years and the flood seized them for they were wrongdoers
so we saved him and those with him in the ark and made it a sign for the worlds
and remember abraham when he said to his people worship allah and fear him
that is better for you if you only knew
you only worship images instead of allah and you are only a falsehood
indeed those whom you worship besides allah have no power over you
so seek thou not forgiveness of allah
and seek your provision from allah and worship him and thank him
to him will you be returned
but if you deny then nations before you have belied the messengers
the messenger is only responsible for clear notification
have they not seen how allah originates creation then repeats it indeed that is easy for allah
say travel in the land and see how god originated the creation
he punishes whom he wills and he receives the command and to him you will be returned
you can not frustrate him in the earth or in the sky
and other than allah you have neither a wali protector nor any helper
those who disbelieve in the signs of allah and in the meeting with him have despaired of my mercy
for them is a painful punishment
but the only answer of his people was that they said kill him or burn him
but allah saved him from the fire
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
he said you have taken idols instead of allah in this worldly life but you have made friendship with mutual hatred in this life and on the day of resurrection you shall live in the life of the world
your destiny is the fire and you will have no saviors ”
then lot believed in him and said “ i am emigrating to my lord the almighty the wise ”
and we gave him isaac and jacob and we gave him his book
and we gave him his wage in this world and in the hereafter he shall be among the righteous
and lot when he said to his people you commit alfahishah sodomy in the same way before you
what do you approach men and commit in your assembly and commit dishonor sodomy with your gatherings
but the only answer of his people was that they said bring us god s chastisement if you are truthful
he said my lord help me against the corrupt people
and when our messengers came to abraham with good news they said we will destroy the people of this city indeed its inhabitants are wrongdoers
he said “ lot is in it ”
they said we are well aware of those who are in it and we will surely be of those who are worthy to be drowned
we will save you and your family except for his wife who is one of those who stay behind
and when our messengers came to lot he was troubled and distressed for them
they said have no fear nor grieve
we will save you and your family except your wife who will stay behind
we will bring down upon the people of this city a scourge from the sky because of their evildoing
and we have left thereof a sign for a people who understand
and to midian we sent their brother shu aib
worship allah my lord
lo
do not act wickedly on earth causing corruption
but they denied him so the earthquake seized them and they lay in their homes in their homes
and ad and thamud people
satan made their deeds seem decorous to them and barred them from the path though they were endued with perception
and korah pharaoh and haman
and moses came to them with clear signs but they waxed arrogant in the land so they could not outstrip us
each we seized for his sin
and some we loosed a squall of pebbles and some we caused the earth to swallow them and some we drowned the people of the towns
it was not for allah to wrong them they wronged themselves
the likeness of those who take other patrons than allah is as the likeness of the spider who taketh the spider s house is the weakest of the spider s house if they only knew
indeed allah knows whatever thing they invoke besides him he is the allmighty the allwise
and these similitudes we coin them for mankind but none understands save the knowledgeable
allah created the heavens and the earth with consummate wisdom
surely in that is a sign for believers
recite what has been revealed to you of the book and maintain the prayer and forbids indecency and dishonour
and remember allah s remembrance ’ is greater
and allah knows what you do
and do not approach the people of the book except with you except those who do wrong with you and do not approach them except with kindness and make a way of your religion
and when their way is gone in the same way
if you were to believe in what your lord has sent down to you ”
and we have been commanded to worship him
even so we have revealed to you the book
those to whom we gave the book believe in it and when it is recited to him they believe in it
and none gainsay our signs except the disbelievers
you did not read any scripture before it nor did you write it down with your right hand for then the impugners of those who were skeptical
nay but these are in clear signs and the clear signs
none denies our signs except the unjust
and they say why has not a sign been sent down to him from his lord
say the signs are only with god
i am only a plain warner ”
is it not sufficient for them that we have sent down to you the book which is recited to them
surely in that is a mercy and a reminder for a people who believe
say allah suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
and those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in allah it is they who are the losers
they ask you to hasten the punishment
and had it not been for a term appointed for the punishment would have come upon them
it will come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
they ask you to hasten the punishment
hell will engulf the disbelievers
on the day when the punishment envelopes them from above them and from beneath their feet and he will say taste what you used to do
o my servants who believe
every soul shall taste of death then unto us ye shall be returned
and those who believe and do good deeds we will surely settle them in the lofty abodes of paradise beneath which rivers flow they will abide eternally therein eternally
how excellent is the reward of those who toil
who persevere and put their trust in their lord
how many a moving creature there is that beareth not its own provision and allah is the hearer the knower
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon they will say god has subjugated the sun
so where are they being led away
allah outspreads and restricts his provision to whomsoever he will of his worshipers
allah is knower of all things
if you ask them who sends down water from the sky and quickens the earth after it had died they would surely say allah
say all praise belongs to allah but most of them do not know
say all praise be to allah but they do not understand
the life of this world is nothing but play and play
the home of the hereafter is indeed the eternal life if only they knew
when they embark in the ships they call upon allah consecrating their faith solely to him
but when he brings them safely to land they associate others with him
so that they may be ungrateful for what we have given them and that they may know
have they not seen that we have appointed a sanctuary secure sanctuary while all around them are despoiled
do they believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the favor of allah
and who is more unjust than he who fabricates a lie against allah or denies the truth when it comes to him
is there not a lodging in hell for the blasphemers
as for those who strive in our cause we will surely guide them to our paths
and allah is with the doers of good
alif lam meem
the romans have been defeated
in a nearby land but they after their defeat will be victorious
in a few years
on that day the command is to allah and after the believers will rejoice
in the help of allah he helps whom he wills
he is the mighty the merciful
the promise of allah
allah does not break his promise but most people do not know
they know a portion of the life of the world but they are heedless of the hereafter
do they not reflect upon themselves god created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except with truth and for a stated term
and many people deny the meeting with their lord
have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of those before them
they were stronger than them and they plowed the earth and built it was harder to them
their messengers came to them with clear signs
it was not for allah to wrong them they wronged themselves
then evil was the end of those who committed evil and mocked at the verses of allah and they used to mock at them
allah originates creation then brings it back again then to him you will be returned
on the day when the hour sets in the despair of the sinners will despair
and they will have no intercessors for them and they will disown their partners
on the day when the hour takes place they will be divided
as for those who believed and did good deeds they will be in a garden rejoicing
but as for those who disbelieved and denied our signs and the meeting of the hereafter they will be arraigned into the punishment
so glorify allah when you enter the evening and when you rise up at dawn
and his is the praise in the heavens and the earth and glorify him at noon
he brings the living from the dead and brings the dead out of the living
likewise will you be raised from the dead
and of his signs is that he created you from dust and behold you are human beings dispersed everywhere
and of his signs is that he created for you mates from yourselves that you may find repose in them and he planted between you and mercy
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the difference of your languages and colours
surely in that are signs for those of knowledge
and of his signs is your sleep by night and day and your lord in the darkness of his bounty verily herein are signs for a people who hearken
and of his signs is that he shows you the lightning and hope and he sends down water from the sky and revives the earth after it comes down water
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and of his signs is that the heaven and the earth stand firm and then when he calls you from the earth you will emerge
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
it is he who originates creation then reverts it
that is easy for him
his is the highest attribute to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and he is the allmighty the allwise
he is the most mighty the most wise
he sets forth for you a similitude of your own selves and among yourselves who have enjoyed your own partners in the sustenance we have provided you so that you may observe the portion of your own people who are equal in respect of what we have made clear
nay but the wrongdoers follow their own lusts without knowledge
who then can guide him whom allah has sent astray
they will have no helpers
so set your face to the religion of a man as a man of pure faith
there is no altering of god s creation
this is the right religion but most people do not know
that is the right religion but most people do not know
say o muhammad saw o my people
and turn to him in repentance and turn to him in repentance
so keep away from him and be not of the idolaters
of those who split up their religion and became sects each faction exulting in what it has carved
when adversity touches the people they call upon their lord turning to him
then when he lets them taste of his mercy behold they associate others with their lord associate others with their lord
so that they may deny what we have given them
so enjoy yourselves for you will soon know
or have we sent down to them any authority that speaks of that they associate with him
and when we give people a taste of mercy they rejoice in it
but when adversity comes upon them for what their hands have perpetrated they begin to despair
do they not see that allah enlarges the provision for whom he wills and restricts it
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
so give the relative his right and to the needy and to the traveller
that is best for those who seek the countenance of allah and it is they who are the successful
and whatever you give in usury that it may increase in the wealth of men and that allah may give alms and that allah is not pleased with the charitable
so those who eat of their deeds in this world will be established in the hereafter
it is allah who created you then provided you with sustenance then he will bring you back to life
is there any of your partners who does anything of that
glory be to him
high be allah exalted above all that they associate with him
corruption has appeared on his family and on the sea of that which the people earned of the land and sea may make them taste some of what they have done haply they will return
say travel in the land and see what was the end of those before you
most of them were idolaters
so set your face towards the right religion before the day comes from allah on the day when they are averted from the day when the two groups will be sundered
whoever disbelieves upon him falls his unbelief
and whosoever worketh righteously and is preparing for themselves
so that he may reward those who believe and do good deeds out of his bounty
he does not love the unbelievers
and of his signs is that he sends the winds as bearers of good news and that he may bring you out of his mercy and that you may seek of his bounty and that you may seek of his bounty and that you may give thanks
and assuredly we sent messengers before thee unto their people
then we took vengeance upon them and we drowned the guilty
it is incumbent upon us to help the believers
it is allah who sends the winds so he spreads them in clouds and brings them out of heaven and disperses them out of heaven and disperses of drops of rain and he sends down from the sky
then when he maketh it fall down from the midst of his servants immediately they rejoice
although before that they were despondent before it was sent down upon them
so observe the effects of allah s mercy ’ how he revives the earth after it had died
indeed he is the reviver of the dead and he is over all things competent
and if we send a wind and they see it yellow they would still continue to turn yellow
you can not make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn away
nor can you guide the blind out of their error
you can make none hear except those who believe in our verses and have submitted
allah is he who created you weak then after weakness gave you strength then after strength gave you weakness and grey hair
he creates what he wills
he is allknowing allpowerful
on the day when the hour sets in the guilty will swear that they had stayed away but an hour thus they were deluded
but those who have been given knowledge and faith will say you remained in the book of allah until the day of resurrection
this is the day of resurrection but you did not know
on that day their excuses will not profit the harmdoers nor will they be suffered to make amends
and indeed we have explained in this qur an in this quran every kind of example
but if you bring a sign for them they will surely say “ you are nothing but falsifiers ”
thus does allah seal the hearts of those who do not know
say o muhammad saw o my people
so be patient indeed the promise of allah is true
let them not disquiet thee to believe in the hereafter
alif lam meem
these are the verses of the wise book
a guidance and a mercy for the doers of good
who perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and are certain of the hereafter
these are on guidance from their lord and it is they who are the successful
and among mankind is he who talks about to mislead others from the way of allah without knowledge and takes it for mockery
for such there is a shameful punishment
and when our verses are recited to him he turns away arrogantly as if he had not heard them in his ears
so announce to him a painful punishment
as for those who believe and do good deeds for them are gardens of bliss
they will abide therein
the promise of allah is true
he is the mighty the wise
he created the heavens without pillars that you see and cast into the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with you and dispersed in it
and we send down water from the sky and we caused to grow therein goodly growth
such is the creation of allah
now show me what those whom you worship besides him have created
nay the wrongdoers are in manifest error
we gave luqman wisdom saying “ give thanks to allah ”
and whosoever giveth thanks he giveth thanks for his own soul
and whosoever is ungrateful let him know that allah is allsufficient immensely praiseworthy
and remember when luqman said to his son when he was advising to him “ my son do not associate anything with allah indeed the great injustice is a great injustice ”
we have enjoined man upon his parents his mother beareth him in weakness and his mother s weakness and his weaning is weakness in two years
but if they strive to make you associate with me something of which you have no knowledge then do not obey them
so hold fast to the most gracious who turns to me in repentance and follow the path of allah
then to me will be your return whereat i will inform you of what you used to do
o my son even if it be the weight of a grain of mustardseed and even if it be in the heavens or in the earth allah will bring it forth
indeed allah is subtle allaware
my son establish prayer and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong
and bear patiently with patience
that is of the things of courage
and turn not away from men with arrogance nor walk proudly on earth
allah does not like the swaggering braggart
be moderate in your bearing and lower your voice
verily the harshest of all voices is the voice braying of the ass
do you not see that allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and amply bestowed upon you both outward and inward
and of mankind is he who disputeth concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or a book luminous
and when it is said to them follow what allah has revealed they say nay but we found our fathers following
even though satan was inviting them to the punishment of the fire
and whosoever submits his face to allah and is a doer of good he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold
to allah belongs the outcome of all matters
and whosoever disbelieveth let not his unbelief grieve thee
to us is their return and we will inform them of what they used to do
indeed allah is knowing of what is in the breasts
we give them enjoyment for a while then we shall compel them to a harsh punishment
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will say allah
say “ all praise belongs to god but most of them do not know ”
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth indeed allah is allsufficient alllaudable
he is the rich the praised
and if all the trees in the earth were pens and the sea with seven more seas were ink the words of allah would not be exhausted
allah is mighty wise
your creation and your resurrection are only as a single soul
indeed allah is hearing and seeing
have you not seen how allah merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night
he subjected the sun and the moon each running its course till the day of resurrection
allah is aware of what you do
that is because allah is the reality and that which they call upon beside him is the truth
indeed allah is allhigh and supreme
have you not seen how the ships sail in the sea by the favor of allah that he may show you some of his signs
surely in that are signs for every patient grateful person
and when the waves cover them like shadows envelop them they call upon allah making their religion sincerely his religion sincerely his but when they are in the land they make a middle course for worship and that allah s cause between them
none denies our signs except every perfidious ungrateful
o mankind fear your lord and fear a day when no father shall avail his child nor his child nor shall his child nor aught avail his father verily the promise of allah is true so let not the worldly life delude you concerning allah
indeed allah alone has knowledge of the hour
he sends down the rain and he knows what is in the wombs and he knows what is in the wombs and he knows what is in no soul knows in what it will die
indeed allah is allknowing allaware
alif lam meem
the revelation of this book whereof there is no doubt is from the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
or do they say he has invented it
nay it is the truth from your lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you
so that they may be guided
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he established himself on the throne
you have no protector or intercessor besides him
will you not remember
he directs the affair from the heaven to the earth then it ascendeth up in a day whereof the measure is a thousand years of your reckoning
such is the knower of the unseen and the seen the allmighty the allmerciful
who perfected everything he created and he originated all creation of man from clay
then he made his progeny from a base fluid
then he proportioned him and breathed into him of his spirit
he gave you hearing sight and hearts but rarely do you give thanks
and they say when we are lost in the earth shall we be created anew
nay they disbelieve in the meeting with their lord
say the angel of death who has been charged with you will gather you and then you will be returned to your lord
would that the guilty hang their heads before their lord saying ‘ our lord we have seen and heard the last day ’
so send us back to work
we are certain to believe
and if we willed we could have given every soul its guidance but the word is realized against me that i will fill hell with jinn and mankind together
so taste the punishment of your forgetting the day of resurrection
we shall forget you to forget the truth
taste you the chastisement for what you used to do
only those believe in our revelations who when they are reminded of them fall down prostrate and glorify the praises of their lord and they are not arrogant
their sides shun their beds and they supplicate their lord in fear and hope and they spend of what we have provided them
no soul knows what lies hidden in store for them and what they used to do
is he who is a believer like someone who is a transgressor
they are not equal
as for those who believe and do good deeds for them is the gardens of refuge
but as for those who do evil their refuge is the fire
whenever they desire to go out from it they will be driven back from it and it will be said to them taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny
we will make them taste the nearer chastisement prior to the greater chastisement before the greater chastisement haply they will return
and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of his lord and turns away from them
we shall take vengeance upon the sinners
and we gave moses the book so do not be in doubt about moosa and we made it a guidance for the children of israel
and we made from them leaders guiding by our command when they endured patiently and had guided them
indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ
is it not a guidance to them how many generations we destroyed before them amid whose dwellings they walk
verily in that are signs
will they not then listen
have they not seen how we drive water to the parched land and bring forth crops whereof their cattle eat
will they not then see
and they say when will this decision come if you are truthful
say on the day of opening the faith of those who disbelieve will not avail them nor will they be reprieved
so turn away from them and wait they too are waiting
o prophet fear allah and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites
allah is allknowing allwise
follow what is revealed to you from your lord
allah is aware of what you do
and put your trust in allah allah suffices as a trustee
allah has not appointed any man belonging to his two sons
nor has he made your wives your mothers your adopted sons your actual sons your actual sons your real mothers
these are your saying with your mouths
allah says the truth and he guides to the right way
call them after their fathers
that is more equitable in the sight of allah
but if you do not know their fathers then they are your brethren in faith and your brethren in the hereafter
there is no fault in you if you make mistakes but you can not blame on your hearts
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
the messenger of them is more just as they are nearer to the believers
none can change his face
and if you marry the believers in the past is more worthy of the blood
this is inscribed in the book of the first creation and the emigrants who emigrated and fought for you
and that which is disreputable and that which your affairs has been charged with us and he has been endowed with wisdom
and recall what time we took a bond from the prophets and from thee and we took from noah and abraham and moses and jesus son of mary
that he may question the truthful concerning their truthfulness and he has prepared for the unbelievers a painful punishment
o you who believe remember allah s blessing ’ upon you when there came against you a armies of the armies of allah s blessings ’ upon you
we unleashed against them stones of baked clay
and allah is ever allseer of what you do
when they came upon you from above you and from below you and when eyes were stupefied with horror and hearts jumped to the throats and the hearts of allah came to pass away
there were the believers sorely tried and shaken with a mighty shaking
when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said allah and his messenger promised us naught but illusion
and when a faction of them said o people of yathrib there is no stability for you so go back to your place
until when a door of the prophet they asked leave of the enemy they were exposed to the enemy of the prophet saying our homes lie exposed to the enemy
and they lay not open
they but wished to flee
and if they had entered upon from the sides of the city they had asked to apostatize they would have done it and they would have found it in a little and a little
they had already sworn by allah before that they would not turn their backs to flee
and covenants with allah shall be questioned about the promise
say flight will not avail you if you flee from death or killing of death then you will not be allowed to enjoy life but a little while
say who is it that can protect you from allah if he intends to afflict you or intends mercy for you
they will find besides allah no protector or helper
allah knows those among you who hinder others from among you and those who say to their brethren come to us and come to battle but a little while
being miserly towards you
when fear approaches you see them looking at you their eyes rolling like someone fainting at death
then when the danger passes away from their greed for their sake they lash you with sharp tongues and they give ear to the believers
so allah nullifies their deeds
that is easy for allah
they think that the invading confederates have not departed
and if the confederates were to come they would wish to wish they would wish to be in the desert among the bedouins inquiring about you from among the bedouins
and if they had stayed among you they would have fought but little
indeed in the messenger of allah you have a good example for him who looketh to allah and the last day and remembers allah frequently
when the believers saw the confederates they said this is the promise of allah and his messenger promised us
and if the good things are made known to the believers
they are only a warner and they are deluded by allah
among the believers are men who have pledged to god
among them are some who have fulfilled their vow and some of them are waiting
they have not changed in the least
that allah may recompense the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if he wills or accept their repentance
indeed allah is allforgiving allmerciful
allah drove back the faithless in their rage and gained no advantage booty
they did not touch anyone with plenty of the booty
allah sufficed the believers in their fight
allah is strong and mighty
and he brought down from their strongholds those who were given the book s and cast terror into their hearts
some you slew and some you took captive
he bequeathed you their lands and their homes and their possessions and a land which you had not trodden
allah is able to do all things
say o muhammad saw o your wives if you desire the life of this world and its adornment then i will provide you handsomely and release you with a handsome release
but if you desire god and his messenger and the abode of the hereafter then god has prepared for the doers of good among you a mighty wage
o wives of the prophet whosoever of you commits an evil act righteously doubled shall be doubled
that is easy for allah
and whosoever of you and his messenger and doeth right we shall give her her wage twice over and we have prepared for her a generous provision
o wives of the prophet you are not like any other women if you are godfearing so do not be like any other women lest you should be soft in speech lest you should be a companion in whose heart is sickness
stay in your houses and do not flaunt your finery as the pagan arabs used to do
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and obey allah and his messenger
allah only wishes to remove uncleanness from you o members of the household and to purify you thoroughly
and remember what is recited in your houses of allah s revelations ’ and wisdom
indeed allah is subtle and acquainted
indeed the muslim men and muslim women and the believing women and the truthful men and women who are truthful men and women who give alms and the truthful men and women who guard their modesty and the truthful men and women who remember allah has prepared forgiveness and
it is not for any believing man or woman when allah and his messenger have decreed a matter for his believing slaves
whoever disobeys allah and his messenger has gone astray
and remember when you said to him whom allah had blessed and you said to him be good to you and you concealed from yourself and fear allah and his mother what allah had enjoined upon you and you concealed within yourself what allah had concealed within him
and you feared that you fear allah while it is he who has more right to you
so when zaid had accomplished his relationship we gave her to you in marriage so that there may be no sin upon you for the faithful for the faithful after the consultation of their adopted sons and the marriage of the faithful
the decree of allah must be fulfilled
there is no blame on the prophet regarding what allah has ordained for him
that was the way of allah with those who passed away before
the command of allah is a decree determined
who deliver the messages of allah and feared him and feared him and feared none except allah
allah keepeth account
muhammad is not the father of any of your men
he is the lord of the people of the world
allah has knowledge of everything
o you who believe remember allah with much remembrance
and glorify him morning and evening
it is he who blesses you and his angels to bring you out of darkness into light
and allah is ever merciful to the believers
their greeting on the day when they meet him will be peace
and he has prepared for them a generous wage
o prophet we have sent you as a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
and as a summoner unto allah by his leave and as a lamp
give the glad tidings to the believers that they will have a great reward
and do not obey the faithless and the hypocrites
ignore their talk and put your trust in allah
allah is sufficient as a trustee
o believers when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them then there is no waitingperiod for you if you do not count them then take them back for you in respect of release
o prophet we have made lawful for you wives from your wives whom you have given their dowries and the daughters of your mother s daughters ’ and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts and
we know what restrictions we have ordained for you and their wives and those whom their right hands possess and their lot is exempted from you
and allah is forgiving merciful
you may defer any of them you may take away whom you please and you may take any other god besides them
and if you desire any of those you have deferred there is no blame upon you for what you have given them
that is their interpretation which they are pleased and so that you may be satisfied with what is better for them
allah is knower indulgent
allah is allknowing allforbearing
after this there are no lawful for you after that nor for you to change them for other wives even though their beauty pleases you except those whom your right hand possesses
allah is watchful over everything
o you who believe do not enter the houses of the prophet unless you are told for a meal without awaiting its readiness
but when you are invited enter and disperse without lingering for conversation
that is hurtful to you but he is shy of asking you to go about
but allah is not shy of the truth
and when you ask his womenfolk for something ask them from behind a curtain
that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts
it is not for you to cause annoyance to you from allah s messenger nor to marry his wives after him that is indeed a mighty sin
whether you reveal a thing or conceal it god is cognisant of everything
there is no fault in their fathers or their brothers or their brothers sons or their brothers sons or their brothers sons or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or their sisters sons or their women slaves
lo
allah is witness over all things
allah and his angels shower blessings on the prophet
o you who believe invoke blessings upon him and invoke blessings upon him
verily those who hurt allah and his messenger allah hath cursed them in this world and in the hereafter and hath gotten ready for them a torment ignominious
and those who annoy believing men and believing women undeservedly bear the guilt of slander and manifest sin
o prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their veils over them
that is more suitable for them so that they may be recognised
and allah is oftforgiving most merciful
if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease and those who make a commotion in the city do not desist we shall rouse you against them then they will not be your neighbours therein except a little while
accursed wherever they are found and slain thoroughly and slain thoroughly
such was the way of allah with those who passed away before them
you will find no change in allah s system ’
people ask you about the hour say the knowledge of it is with allah
say “ allah alone has knowledge of it ”
what will make you know perhaps the hour is near
indeed allah has cursed the faithless and prepared for them a blazing fire
they will abide therein and no savior for them
on the day when their faces are turned about in the fire they will say would that we had obeyed allah and obeyed the messenger
they will say our lord we obeyed our chiefs and our dignitaries and they misled us from the way
our lord give them double punishment and curse them with a mighty curse ”
o you who believe
allah cleared him of what they said
he was distinguished with god
o you who believe fear allah and speak words of appropriate justice
he will rectify your deeds for you and forgive you your sins
whosoever obeys allah and his messenger he has achieved a mighty achievement
we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains but they refused to bear it and were afraid of it and man undertook it and was very very very unjust
allah will punish the hypocrites men and women and the idolaters and idolatrous women and the idolaters and the idolaters men and women alike and relent toward them
and allah is ever oftforgiving most merciful
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth belongs to allah
and his is the praise in the hereafter and he is the allwise the allaware
he knows what penetrates into the earth and what comes out of it what comes down from it what descends from the sky and what ascends to it
and he is the merciful the forgiving
those who disbelieve say the hour will not come to us
say yes by my lord it is the knower of the unseen
not an atom s weight in the heavens or in the earth escapeth him
no thing is but a small thing but it is recorded in a clear book
that he may recompense those who believe and do good works
for them is forgiveness and noble provision
and those who endeavoured to frustrate our signs for them awaits a painful punishment
those who have been given the knowledge see what has been revealed to you from your lord is the truth and guides to the path of the mighty the praiseworthy
the faithless say ‘ shall we direct you to a man who will tell you that when you have become dust ’
has he fabricated a lie against allah or is he a madness in him
nay but those who do not believe in the hereafter are in a torment and are in far error
have they not seen what is before them and what is behind them of the sky and the earth
if we will we can make the earth swallow them or cause the water to fall down upon them
surely in that is a sign for every penitent worshiper
and we gave david bounty from us and said o mountains repeat the mountains with him “ o mountains ”
saying make coats of armor and measure their links
and you are the great sin
i am seer of what ye do
and we subjected the wind to sulaiman solomon its morning course was a month s journey and its evening course was a month
and we made a spring of tar flow for him and the birds as they were a molten brass
and as for those who worked worked out of their lord s command we shall make them taste the chastisement of the blaze
they made for him what he wished to elevated chambers statues bowls like reservoirs and stationary
o family of dawud david seek help me and give thanks to allah
few of my slaves are grateful
then when we decreed death for him nothing indicated to death except a creature of the jinn which gnawed away his staff
and when he fell down the jinn realized that if they had known the unseen they would not have continued in the ignominious punishment
there was a sign for sheba
in the right hand and the left of the two gardens and the two of the two of the two men and sanctuary and ask for him who was thankful
a good land and a forgiving lord
but they turned away so we sent on a part of the dam
and we exchanged them with the gardens of datepalms and grapes and we exchanged their two gardens with two gardens bearing bitter fruit and tamarisk
thus do we requite them for their unbelief and we recompense the unbeliever
and we had blessed towns between them and the towns which we had blessed and we had set wellmeasured stages between them by night and day
it will be said ‘ travel between them by night and day in safety ’
but they said our lord make the stages of our journeys longer
so they wronged themselves so we reduced them to bygone tales and dispersed them in scattered floating
verily in that are signs for every patient grateful person
iblis satan has now departed from them
they followed him except for a group of believers
and he had no authority over them except that we might know who believes in the hereafter from him who is in doubt about it
your lord is watchful over everything
say call upon those whom you assert other than allah
they do not possess an atom s weight in the heavens and the earth nor do they have any share in either nor do they have any share in either of them
intercession will not avail him at all save his intercession
so do not fear allah while you are sincere
when terror are lifted from their hearts they will say what has your lord said
they say the truth
and he is the most high the grand
say who provides you sustenance from the heavens and the earth
say god
but you are either in error or in manifest error ’
say you will not be questioned about our sins nor will we be questioned about what you do
say our lord will bring us together then he will judge between us equitably
he is the allknowing judge
say show me those whom you have attached to him as partners
no indeed
nay but he is allah the mighty the wise
we have sent you only as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner but most men do not know
and they say when will this promise come if you are truthful
say o muhammad saw there is a day you can not postpone it nor advance it by an hour
the unbelievers say we will never believe in this quran nor in that before it
if you could only see when the wrongdoers are called out to their lord casting the weak ones before their lord throwing out those who were arrogant will say to those who were arrogant ‘ were it not for you we would have been believers ’
those who were arrogant will say to those who were abased will we drive you away from the guidance after it had come to you
nay but ye yourselves were guilty
those who were suppressed will say to those who were arrogant “ it was your scheming night and day when you were ordering us to forswear allah ”
they will hide their remorse when they see the punishment
we shall put iron collars round the necks of those who disbelieved
are they requited aught save what they used to do
and we never sent a warner to any town but its wealthy ones said “ we disbelieve in what you have been sent with ”
they said we have more wealth and children and we are nearer to be punished
say “ my lord outspreads and restricts the provision of the heavens and the earth but most people do not know ”
it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you closer to us
except those who believe and do good deeds – for them is a twofold reward for their deeds and they will be in lofty abodes in a high position and they will be in peace
and those who strive against our revelations challenging us to frustrate them
say “ my lord outspreads and restricts it for whomever he wills of his servants
and whatever you spend in the way of allah he is the best of providers
and on the day when he will gather them all together then he will say to the angels was it you these used to worship
they will say “ glory be to you they are our master
nay they worshipped the devils for us
they say “ the most of them ”
today you have no power to profit or hurt one another
and we will say to the wrongdoers “ taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny ”
and when our clear revelations are recited to them they say this is nothing but a man who wants to bar you from what your fathers worshipped but a calumny and they say this is nothing but a calumny
and those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them this is naught but magic
and we did not give them any scriptures which they study nor did we send to them any warner before you
those before them also denied and they have not attained onetenth of what we had given them but they denied my messengers so how was my disapproval
say i give you only one thing stand up for god two or one of you stand up in pairs and individually
he is naught but a warner unto you before a severe torment
say whatever payment i might have asked of you is yours
my reward lies only with allah
he is witness over all things
say “ my lord projects the truth
he is the knower of things hidden
say truth has come
the truth has come and falsehood will not revert
say if i go astray i go astray only to my own loss and if i am rightlyguided that is because of what my lord has revealed to me
he is allhearing and nearmost
and couldst thou see when they are terrified for a terror
so they will be seized by a nearby place
and they say we believe in it
but how can they attain it from a faroff place
they disbelieved in it before and aimed at the unseen
and a barrier will be set between them and what they desire as was done with their likes
they were in disturbing doubt
all praise is due to allah the creator of the heavens and the earth the angels the messengers the wings two three or four
he increases in creation what he wills
indeed allah is over all things competent
whatever mercy allah unfolds for mankind none can withhold his mercy and whatever he withholds none can release it
he is the mighty the wise
o mankind remember the favor of allah upon you
is there any creator other than allah who provides for you from the heaven and the earth
there is no god but he
so where are you being led away
if they deny you messengers before you were also rejected
to allah all matters are returned
o mankind
the life of this world is merely an illusory enjoyment
so do not let satan avert you from satan s evil conduct ’
satan is an enemy to you so take him as an enemy
he only invites his gang to be among the owners of the blaze
as for those who disbelieve theirs will be a severe torment and a great reward
is he then whose evil deed of good deeds he regards it so that he considers it good
allah leads astray whomever he wills and guides whomever he wills
so do not fret yourself to death regretting for them
allah is aware of what they do
it is allah who sends the winds that stir up clouds
then we drive it to a dead land that revive the earth to a dead land
such is the raising up
whosoever desireth glory belongs to god
so he is only the devout and the devout are obedient to him
he is the hearer of good
but those who contrive evil deeds will have a severe punishment and their plotting is in vain
allah created you from dust then from a sperm drop then he made you pairs
no female beareth or bringeth forth save with his knowledge
and no aged man is granted additional life nor is his life but it is in a book
indeed that is easy for allah
the two seas are not alike this sweet thirst quenching thirst quenching thirst quenching and saltish and bitter
and from them both you eat fresh tender meat and extract of ornaments which you wear
and you see the ships cleaving the seawater so that you may seek of his bounty and perhaps you will give thanks
he merges the night into the day and he merges the day into the night
he subjected the sun and the moon each running its course till the day of resurrection
that is allah your lord
and those whom you invoke besides him do not possess an excellent intercession
if you call them to your prayer they can not hear you and if they heard they would not answer you
on the day of resurrection they will disown you as they used to worship allah
and none can inform you like him who is aware
o mankind you are the ones who stand in need of allah and allah is allsufficient alllaudable
if he wills he can put you away and bring about a new creation
and that is not difficult for allah
no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another
and if one heavyburdened calls another to carry his load nothing of it will be carried nothing of it except the needy and the traveller
you warn only those who fear their lord in secret and perform the prayer
he who purifies himself purifies himself for his own sake
to allah is the final return
the blind and the seeing are not alike
nor are alike darkness and light
nor shade and heat
nor are alike the living nor the dead
equal are the like of the faithful and the faithless
allah makes whom he wills to hear but you can not make those who are in the graves hear
you are only a warner
we have sent you with the truth a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
there is not a nation but that there has passed to him a warner
and if they deny you those before them also gave the lie to their messengers and their messengers came to them with clear proofs and scriptures and the book and the scriptures of the torah and the injeel gospel
then i seized those who disbelieved and how terrible was my disapproval
have you not seen how god sends down water from the sky and we produce therewith fruits of varying colors and red of diverse hues and of diverse hues and others are streaks of black
and of mankind are cattle and beasts and cattle diverse hues
only those fear allah owner of his slaves who have knowledge
indeed allah is allmighty allforgiving
verily those who recite the book of allah and perform assalat iqamatassalat and spend in the cause of allah and spend in the cause of allah and spend out of what we have bestowed upon them in public and hope that you will not hear a loss
so that he may pay them their wages and increase them in full for his bounty
he is forgiving responsive
that which we have revealed to you of the book is the truth confirming what was revealed before it
indeed allah is allaware allseeing
then we gave the book to those we chose from our servants and we made some of them exceed others in their hearts some of them are lukewarm and some are outstrippers
that is the great bounty
they will enter the gardens of eden which they will enter and therein will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be silk
and they will say all praise belongs to allah who has removed all sorrow from us
indeed our lord is forgiving and appreciative
who has settled us in the home of permanence by his grace lodged us in the mansion of eternity where neither weariness nor weariness will touch us
as for the unbelievers theirs is the fire of gehenna
they will not be able to avert death nor will its punishment be lightened for them
thus do we requite every thankless soul
they will cry therein “ our lord
bring us out of our own acts so that we may do not do good deeds
did we not grant you a long enough span enough for him who reflected
and the warner came to you
so taste
the wrongdoers will have no saviors ”
indeed allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth
he is aware of what is in the breasts of men
it is he who made you caliphs in the earth
whoever disbelieves his disbelief will recoil upon him
the disbelief of the disbelievers adds nothing but loss and disbelief increaseth them in the life of the disbelievers their disbelief increases in naught save loss
say have you considered your partners whom you invoke besides allah show me what they have created of the earth or have they partnership with allah
or do they have any partnership in the heavens
or have we given them a book so that they stand on a clear proof therefrom
no the wrongdoers promise each other except delusion
indeed allah restrains the heavens and the earth lest they cease not
and if they cease then they could not find them any one to be able to conceal it except him and allah is oft forgiving most forbearing
he is most forbearing exceedingly forgiving
they solemnly swore by allah that if a warner came to them they would be better than any of the nations
but when a warner came to them it only increased them in aversion
and their arrogance in the land and their plotting of evil plotting evil and evil plotting of evil
but the evil plot will they own only
so do they not find any change in the way of allah and you will never find any change in the ways of allah
have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them although they were stronger in power than they
and allah is not such that aught in the heavens or in the earth escapeth him
indeed he is allknowing allpowerful
if allah were to take people to task for what they have earned he would not leave a moving creature on the earth but he does not leave them on the day of resurrection
but he defers them until when their time comes he will surely compensate them according to his plan and allah is seeing your deeds
ya seen
by the wise qur an
you o muhammad are one of the messengers
on a straight path
this is a revelation of the mighty the merciful
so that you may warn a people whose ancestors were not warned so they are unaware
and indeed the word has proved true upon most of them so they do not believe
they will have no knowledge of it except what they have been warned
we have put fetters around their necks and their heads are upturned
and we have put before them a barrier and a barrier behind them so they are covered with a cloak
and the eyes will be blind and they will not be able to see
it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them they will not believe
you can only warn him who follows the reminder and fears the most merciful unseen
so give him good tidings of forgiveness and a generous wage
it is we who revive the dead to life and we record what they send ahead and their traces
we have tallied all things in a clear record
and cite for them the example of the city when the messengers came to it
when we sent to them two messengers they impugned both of them
we reinforced them with a third and they said “ we have been sent to you ”
they said you are but mortals like us the most beneficent allah has not sent down anything you are only lying
they said our lord knows that we are messengers to you
and our duty is only to convey plainly
they said we augur ill of you
if you do not desist we will stone you and will surely stone you to death
they said your evil augury be with you
is it because you are reminded
no but you are a transgressing lot ’
then a man came running from the furthest part of the city he said o my people follow the messengers
follow those who ask no wage of you and are rightlyguided
why should i not worship him who created me
to him will you be returned
shall i take other gods besides him
and if the most gracious should rescue me will not avail me anything against their own desires nor will they save me
indeed i should be in manifest error
i am indeed your lord
“ and i have believed in your lord so listen to me ”
it was said to him enter paradise
how my lord has forgiven me and made me one of the honoured ones ’
and after him we sent not down upon his people after him any host from heaven nor did we send down any down
it was only one shout and they were extinguished
alas for the servants
no messenger came to them but they ridiculed him
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them who will not return to them
and they will all come before us
and a sign for them is the dead land we quicken the dead and we bring forth from it grain which they eat
and we made therein gardens of datepalms and grapes and we make therein gush forth
so that they may eat of its fruit and their hands worked it not
will they not give thanks
glory be to him who created all the pairs of what the earth produces and of themselves and of what they do not know
and a sign for them is the night and we strip the day out of it and they are in darkness
and the sun runs on its fixed course for him who is the disposition of the almighty the allknowing
and the moon we have determined it as a predetermined time
it is not the sun to overtake the moon nor does the night outstrip the day each in an orbit
and a sign for them is that we carried their offspring in the laden ark
and we have created for them the like of it whereon they ride
and if we will we drown them and they will not be helped
unless it be save by mercy from us and leave them as a comfort for a while
and when it is said unto them beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you haply ye may find mercy
never came there to them any sign of the signs of their lord but they turned away from it
and when it is said unto them expend of that which allah hath provided you say unto the infidels shall we feed those whom allah should feed
you are only in manifest error
and they say when will this promise come if you are truthful
they await only one shout which will seize them while they are disputing
then they will not be able to make a will nor will they return to their homes
and the trumpet will be blown and behold they will come out from the tombs to their lord
they will say “ woe to us
who roused us from our sleepingplace
this is what the merciful promised and the day of judgement
the messengers say “ the truth ”
it is but one shout and behold they are all arraigned before us
today no soul shall be wronged in the least and you shall not be recompensed except for what you used to do
verily the fellows of the garden today shall be happily employed
they and their spouses in shade reclining on couches in shady groves
therein they will have all that they ask for
peace a word from the merciful lord
“ and separate yourselves this day o you guilty ”
children of adam did i not enjoin you to worship he is a manifest enemy
and that you should worship me this is the straight path
and he has led astray many of you astray
did you not understand
this is the hell which you were promised
roast in it today for that you were unbelievers
today we shall seal their mouths and their hands will speak to us and their feet bear witness to what they used to earn
and if we will we could have removed the veil so they would see the path so how could they see
and if we willed we could have deformed them in their place so they would not go forward nor would they return
and whomever we grant him long life we reverse him in creation
will they then not understand
we have not taught him poetry nor is it meet him
this is naught else than a reminder and a lecture in luminous
that he may warn him who is alive and feels the word of doom
have they not seen how we have created for them of our handiwork so that they may be their owners
and we subdued them unto them so that they ride and some they eat
and they have other uses in them and drinks
will they not give thanks
and they have taken besides allah aliha gods hoping that they may be helped
they can not help them but they are arrayed as their army
so let not their speech grieve you
we know what they hide and what they disclose
does man not see that we created him from a sperm drop and lo he is a manifest adversary
and he has struck for us a similitude and forgotten his own creation he says who will quicken the bones when they have decayed
say he who created them the first time
he has knowledge of every creation
who has made for you fire from the green tree fire and from it you ignite
is not he who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them
yes indeed
he is the knower the knower
his command when he wills a thing is to say to it “ be ” and it is
glory be to him in whose hand is the kingdom of all things
to him you will be returned
by those who range themselves in rows
and those who drive away the clouds vigorously
and those who recite the reminder
verily your god is one
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the lord of the easts
we have adorned the lower heaven with the stars
and have protected it from every rebellious devil
they can not listen to the high assembly of the angels and they are pelted from every side
repelled and theirs is a perpetual punishment
except one who snatches a fragment and he is pursued by a piercing flame
so ask them o muhammad are they stronger in constitution or those we created
we created them of clinging clay
nay you marvel at the wondrous creations of allah while they scoff
and when they are admonished they pay no heed
and when they see a sign they scoff at it
and they say this is nothing but plain magic
what when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we then be raised again
and our forefathers too
say yes and you will be lowly
it will be only a single shout and they will be watching
they will say “ woe to us
this is the day of recompense ”
this is the day of judgement which you used to deny
gather all the wrongdoers and their spouses and their gods
instead of allah and lead them to the path of hell
and stop them verily they are to be questioned
what is the matter with you why do you not help one another
nay but today they resign themselves in submission
and some of them will confront others questioning each other
they will say “ you used to come to us from the right side ”
they will say nay you yourselves were not believers
we had no authority over you but you were a transgressing people
so the word of our lord has come into effect upon us we will surely be tasting it
so we seduced you to error and we were perverts
so they will all share in the punishment
that is how we deal with the sinners
and when it was said to them there is no god but allah they were arrogant
and said shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet
nay he hath brought the truth and he hath brought the veracity of the apostles
you will surely taste the painful punishment
and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do
except for allah s sincere servants ’
for them is a known provision
fruits and they highhonoured
in the gardens of delight
on furnishings facing one another
passed round will be passed around with a cup from a spring of wine
white delicious to the drinkers
neither sickness nor their senses will be given to them
and with them are those who restrain their glances desiring chastity
as if they were hidden eggs hidden
then one of them will turn to another questioning
one of them will say “ i had a companion ”
who used to say are you one of those who believe
when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we be requited
he will say will you look down
then he looked down and saw him in the midst of the blazing fire
he will say by allah you almost ruined me
and had it not been for the grace of my lord i would have been among those brought forward to hell
are we not then to die
except our first death and we will not be punished
this is the supreme triumph
for the like of this let the workers work
is this better or the tree of zaqqum
we have made it a trial for the wrongdoers
it is a tree that rises in the depths of hell
its fruit as it were the heads of devils
they will eat from it and fill their bellies with it
then on top of it they will have a brew of boiling water
then their return will be to the flaming fire
they found their fathers steeped in error
so they are in their footsteps
and before them most of the ancients went astray
and we had already sent messengers to them
so see how was the end of those who were warned
except the chosen bondmen of allah
and noah called us to answer his prayer and how excellent is the answerers
and we saved him and his family from the great affliction
and made his descendants the survivors
and left for him a good name in posterity
peace be upon noah among all the worlds
verily we thus we recompense the welldoers
he is one of our believing servants
then we drowned the others
and indeed was abraham of his followers
when he came to his lord with a sound heart
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
is it falsehood that you desire gods other than allah
what then is your opinion of the lord of the worlds
then he cast a glance at the stars
and said “ i am sick ”
so they went away from him departing
then he turned to their gods and said will you not eat
what is the matter with you that you do not speak
then he turned upon them striking them with his right hand
then the people came to him hastening
he said “ do you worship what you yourselves have carved
when allah created you and what you make
they said build for him a building and cast him into the fire
so they plotted a plot against him but we made them abject
he said “ i am going to my lord who will guide me ”
my lord grant me a righteous son
so we gave him the good news of a forbearing son
when he was old enough to go about with him he said o my son i dreamt that i am sacrificing you
so look at the end of my father said he is one of those who are negligent
allah willing thou shalt find me patient and i will find him among the steadfast
then when they had both submitted and he flung down prostrate upon his forehead
we called out to him “ o abraham
you have fulfilled the vision
thus do we reward the doers of good
that was indeed a trying test
and we ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice
and we left for him a goodly remembrance in posterity
peace be upon abraham
verily we thus we recompense the welldoers
he is one of our believing servants
and we gave him the good news of isaac a prophet of the righteous
and we blessed him and isaac
among their descendants are some who do good and some who are clearly unjust to himself
and we also favored moses and aaron
and we saved them and their people from the great distress
and we helped them so that they became the victors
and we gave them the explicit scripture
and showed them the straight path
and we left for him favorable mention among later generations
peace be upon moses and aaron
verily we thus we recompense the welldoers
they are among our faithful devotees
and verily elias was one of the messengers
recall what time he said unto his people will ye not ward off evil
do you call upon ba l and leave the best of creators
allah your lord and the lord of your forefathers
but they denied him so they will be brought back to the punishment
except the chosen slaves of allah
and we left for him a goodly remembrance in posterity
peace be upon elias
verily we thus we recompense the welldoers
he is one of our believing servants
and verily lot was one of the messengers
when we saved him and all his family
except an old woman who remained behind
then we destroyed the others
you pass by them in the morning
and at night will you not understand
and jonah too was one of the messengers
when he ran away to the laden ship
and lots were cast lots and became of the losers
and he who was condemned of life and became condemned
then the whale swallowed him and he was reproaching himself
had he not been one of those who glorify allah
he would have remained in its belly till the day they are raised
but we threw him on a wide bare tract of land and he was sick
and we caused a tree to grow over him
we sent him to a hundred thousand or more
and they believed so we gave him enjoyment for a while
now ask them for thy lord has daughters and sons
or did we create the angels females while they were witnesses
lo it is of their falsehood that they say
allah has begotten
they are liars
has he chosen daughters above sons
what is the matter with you how do you judge
will you not then reflect
or do you have some clear proof
then bring your book if you are truthful
they have invented a relationship between him and the angels
the angels know that they will be arraigned in hell
glorified is allah from all that they allege
except the chosen bondmen of allah
so you and what you worship
can mislead anyone against him
except he who is destined to roast in hell
there is not one of us but has a known position
we are the rangers
and we are those who sing hallelujas to him
and they used to say
if we had a reminder from the ancients
we would have been god s sincere servants ’
but they disbelieved it
soon they will know
and our word has already gone beforehand to our servants who were messengers
that they will be helped
and that our hosts will be the victors
so leave them alone for a while
and watch them
they will soon know
do they seek to hasten our punishment
when it descends in their courtyard evil will be the morning of those forewarned
so turn away from them for a while
and watch them
they will soon know
glory be to thy lord the lord of might the glorious throne
and peace be upon the messengers
and praise be to allah the lord of the worlds
sad
by the qur an containing reminder
nay but the unbelievers are steeped in arrogance
how many a generation we have destroyed before them
they cried out for help but it was the time for escape
and they marvel that a warner has come to them from among themselves and the faithless say ‘ this is a magician and a mendacious liar ’
has he made the gods one god
this is indeed a curious thing
the notables among them go about exhorting go and go to your gods
lo this is a thing designed
we never heard of this in the former faith
this is nothing but a fabrication
has the reminder been sent down to him out of us ”
nay they are in doubt concerning my reminder and they have not yet tasted my punishment
or do they possess the treasures of the mercy of your lord the mighty the bestower
or is theirs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them
so let them ascend to the higher spheres by the means of ascension
they are defeated there is a host of the confederates defeated
before them the people of noah ad and the people of rass and the prophets the <unk>
and thamood and the people of lot and the dwellers of the thicket these were the companies
none of them but belied the messengers wherefore my torment became justified
these are awaiting there lest a single blast
they say our lord hasten our portion before the day of reckoning
bear with patience what they say and remember our bondman dawud david was a man of might he was penitent
we subjected the mountains to glorify him with him at evening and sunrise
and the birds gathered together in flocks
we strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and decisive speech
and has the story of the litigants reached you when they scaled the wall into the sanctuary
when they entered upon david and he was frightened of them
they said “ do not fear we are two litigants one of the other ”
so judge between us and do not exceed the bounds of justice and show us the right way ”
this my brother has ninetynine ewes and i have a great one ewe
he said grant me a thing he has made me a son and he has sought me in argument
he said “ he has wronged you in demanding your ewe in addition to his ewes
many partners oppress one another except those who accepted faith and do righteous deeds and they are few ’
and david realized that we had tested him and he turned to him and fell down prostrate and tried to him and fell prostrate
so we forgave him that and they are in a place of play
and indeed he has a near place of nearness to us and a good place of return
o dawud david
verily we have made you vicegerent on earth
so judge between people with justice and do not follow your lust lest it should lead you astray from the path of allah
indeed those who stray from the way of allah – for them is a severe punishment for having forgotten the day of account
we did not create the heaven and the earth and all that is between them that is between the twain
so woe to the faithless for the fire
or shall we treat those who believe and do good works like those who spread corruption on earth
or shall we treat the pious like the shameless
this is a blessed book we have sent down to you o muhammad that they may ponder its verses and that they may ponder its verses
and we gave david solomon to david he was an excellent servant
when there were displayed before him in the evening
he said “ i have loved the love of niceties to the remembrance of my lord until the sun disappeared behind ”
he said bring them back to me and bring about their legs
and the <unk> of its <unk>
and assuredly we tried sulaiman and cast on his throne a body
then he turned to him in repentance
he said my lord forgive me and grant me a kingdom that will never befit anyone after me indeed you are the bestower
so we subjected to him the wind that ran softly wherever he wished
and the demons every builder and diver
and others bound together in fetters
this is our gift bestow or withhold without reckoning
and indeed he has a near place of nearness to us and a good abode
and remember our worshiper job
when he called out to his lord satan has afflicted me with hardship and pain
stamp thy foot yonder is cool spring
a spring of gushed forth from it and a rock flung forth
and we bestowed on him his family and with them a mercy from us and a reminder for those of understanding
and take your hand in your hand and strike therewith and break not your oath
lo
indeed we found him patient
how excellent a servant of ours he was
he was a penitent
and remember our servants abraham isaac and jacob men of strength and vision
indeed we purified them with a remembrance of the home of the hereafter
they are indeed among the chosen
and remember ishmael elisha and dhu lkifl
this is a reminder and a reminder
for the godfearing is a fine place
the gardens of eden with gates wide open for them
reclining therein on couches they call for plenteous fruit and drink
and with them are maidens of modest gaze
this is what you are promised for the day of reckoning
this is our provision which will never finish
this is for the virtuous and for the insolent is an evil destination
hell where they will roast in
how wretched a resting place
this is scalding water and pus
and other punishments of various kinds
this is a group among those who disbelieved among themselves
there is no welcome for them
they will roast in the fire
they will say nay but you misleaders for you
you prepared this for us an evil restingplace
they will say “ our lord give us double punishment for him ”
and they will say why do we not see men whom we used to count among the wicked
we took them for a laughingstock
or have our eyes swerved from them
that is the true among the inmates of the fire
say i am only a warner
there is no god but he the one the omnipotent
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the mighty the forgiver
say it is a mighty tiding
from which you are turning away
i had no knowledge of the high assembly when they disputed
i am only a warner to you so that they may warn me
and recall what time thy lord said unto the angels verily i am going to create a human being from clay
and when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my spirit fall down before him prostrate
so the angels prostrated themselves all of them
except iblis he was arrogant and became one of the faithless
he said o iblis what prevented you from prostrating yourself to what i created with my hands
are you waxing proud or were you one of the exalted ones ’
he said i am better than he
you created me from fire and you created him from clay
he said then get out of here
you are accursed
and my curse shall rest upon you till the day of recompense
he said “ my lord respite me till the day they are raised ”
said he thou art among the ones that are respited
until the day of the known time
he said by your might i will mislead them all
except your chosen slaves among them
he said “ this is the truth and i speak the truth ”
i will fill hell with you and with those of them who follow you all together
say i ask of you no wage for it nor am i a specious pretender
it is naught but a reminder unto all beings
you will know its truth after a while
the revelation of the book is from allah the mighty the wise
we have sent down to you the book with truth so worship allah making your religion sincerely his sincerely
lo
and those who take protectors besides him say we worship them only that they may bring us nearer to allah
allah will judge between them concerning what they differ
indeed allah does not guide the lying blasphemer
had allah wished to take a son he could have chosen whatever he pleased out of those he created out of those he created
he is the son of allah
he is allah the one the overpowering
he created the heavens and the earth with truth and he folds the night over the day
he subjected the sun and the moon each running in an orbit
indeed he is the allmighty the allforgiver
he created you from one soul
then he made it a big stars for him
he creates you in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation
he creates you in your mothers wombs
that is allah your lord there is no god except him
his is the sovereignty there is no god except him
so where are you being led away
if you disbelieve then verily allah is independent of you
and he approveth not his bondmen but he approveth his bondmen
and if you are grateful for it is only with his own loss
and no bearer of burdens will bear another s burden ’
then to your lord is your return and he will inform you of what you used to do
indeed allah is knowing of what is in the breasts
when adversity touches man he calls to his lord turning to him
then when he bestows his favour upon him he forgets that which he had supplicated to him before and sets up compeers to allah
say o muhammad o my people even if a disbeliever is in your disbelief
you are among the inmates of the fire ”
is he who prays in the watches of the night prostrating and standing in prayer and standing fearing the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord
say are those who know equal to those who do not know
only those possessed of minds remember
say o my servants who believe fear your lord
for those who do good in this world there is good and fear your lord
and allah s earth ’ is spacious
and those who persevere will be rewarded with their rewards without reckoning
say o muhammad saw i am commanded to worship allah making religion pure for him only
and i am commanded to be the first of those who submit themselves to allah
say “ if i disobey my lord i fear the punishment of a tremendous day ”
say “ god i worship sincere to him in my religion ”
so worship whatever you wish besides him
say the losers are those who lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection that is the manifest loss
they will have layers of fire above them and beneath them coverings
that is how god does not pronounce his servants
o my bondmen wherefore fear me
and those who avoid the worship of idols and devote themselves to allah for them are glad tidings so give good news to my servants
who listen to the word and follow the best thereof
these are the ones whom allah has guided
they are the ones of understanding
can you save him whom the word of punishment has become due …
but those who fear their lord for them are high chambers with lofty halls
rivers will flow beneath them
allah does not break his promise
have you not seen that allah sends down water from the sky and threaded it as springs in the earth
then he brings them out of darkness and then he makes it broken stubble
surely in that are signs for a people possessing understanding
is he whose breast allah has opened to islam so that he walks in whose breast is disease of repentance
so woe to those whose hearts are hardened to allah
such are in plain error
allah has sent down the best of narrations the skins of those who fear their lord and their skins soften to the remembrance of allah
so that allah may bring forth their hearts after their hearts
that is the guidance of allah
he guides whom he wills to a straight path
and whomever allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
is he then who will shield himself from the terror of the day of resurrection and will be punished by the fire of hell and he will say to the unjust “ taste the punishment of your deeds ”
those before them belied the messengers
so they did not perceive from where they did not perceive
so allah made them taste disgrace in this life
but the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they only knew
and we have indeed illustrated all kinds of examples for mankind so that they may take heed
a lecture in arabic without any defect so that they may ward off evil
allah coineth a similitude a man shared by disagreeing partners and a man belonging wholly to one man
are the two equal in likeness
are they equal in status
but most of them do not know
you will die and they will die
then on the day of resurrection you will contend before your lord
and who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against allah and denies the truth when it reaches him
is there not in hell a residence for the disbelievers
and he who brings the truth and testifies it is they who are the godwary
they will have whatever they wish from their lord
that is the reward of the doers of good
that allah may remit from them the worst of what they did and reward them for what they used to do
is not allah sufficient for his slave
yet they frighten you with others apart from him
and whomever allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
and whomever allah guides for him there is no misleader
is not allah mighty able to requite the wrong
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will say allah
say “ have you considered if god willed to cause me harm for you they can remove the distress of judgement
or lest it should say if allah wills to grant me mercy they will have mercy on me
say allah is sufficient for me
in him let all the trusting put their trust ’
say o my people
act according to your ability and do you will soon know
to whom comes a punishment that will disgrace and upon whom descends a lasting punishment ’
we have sent down to you the book for mankind
and whosoever goeth right it is for his own loss
and whosoever goes astray he is only to his own loss
you are not a manager over them
allah takes away the souls of those who die and those who do not die in their sleep
he retains the matter of those who are ordained for them and he releases the others until a predetermined time
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
or have they taken intercessors besides allah
say even though they have no intelligence
say to allah belongs all intercession
his is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth then unto him you shall be returned
when allah alone is mentioned the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink with bitterness but when those mentioned they rejoice
say o allah creator of the heavens and the earth and the knower of the unseen and the seen you will judge between your servants concerning that wherein they used to differ
and the wrongdoers possessed of what is in the earth and the like of it they would offer it to ransom themselves from the evil of the day of resurrection and they would offer it to ransom themselves from the punishment of the day of resurrection and they will
and the evils of what they used to mock will appear to them and they will be besieged by what they used to deride
when adversity touches the human being he calls upon us
then when we gave him out of grace from us he says “ i have been given it by virtue of knowledge ”
nay it is a trial but most of them know not
those before them said this is the word of those before them
but their earnings did not avail them
so the evils of what they earned smote them
and those who did wrong among these will be afflicted by the evils of what they used to earn
they will not be able to frustrate us
do they not know that allah enlarges and straitens the provision for whom he wills
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
say o my servants who have transgressed against themselves by sinning do not despair of the mercy of allah
indeed allah forgives all sins
he is the forgiving the merciful
turn to your lord and surrender yourselves to him before the chastisement comes upon you then you will not be helped
follow the fairest of the fairest of what has been revealed to you from your lord before the punishment overtakes you suddenly while you are unaware
lest a soul should say alas for me
i am indeed a messenger of god and the ridiculed of the believers
or lest it should say if allah had guided me i should have been one of the godfearing
or say when it sees the chastisement if only i could return to life and i would be among the doers of good
yes indeed but my signs came to you but you belied them and you were among the faithless
on the day of resurrection you will see those who lied against allah with their faces blackened
is there not in hell a residence for the arrogant
allah will deliver those who ward off evil because of their deserts
evil will touch them neither shall they grieve
allah is the creator of all things and he is the guarantor of all things
to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth
those who disbelieve in the signs of allah it is they who are the losers
say o ye ignorant ones do ye bid me to worship other than allah
and it has been revealed to you and to those before you if you ascribe partners to allah your works will surely be annulled and you will be among the losers
nay but worship allah and be among the thankful
they do not esteem god with true value
but the whole earth will be in his grip on the day of resurrection and the heavens will be folded up in his right hand
glorified be he and exalted above all that they associate with him
and the trumpet will be blown and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will swoon away except whomever allah wills
then it will be blown again and lo they will stand beholding
the earth will shine with the light of its lord and the book will be set in place and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought and the witnesses will be brought and it will be judged between them with justice and they will not be wronged
every soul shall be paid in full for what it had done
allah is the best knower of what they do
the faithless will be driven to hell in throngs
when they reach it its gates are opened and its keepers will say to them did not there come to you messengers from among yourselves reciting to you the verses of your lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours
they will say yes but the word of punishment is realized against the unbelievers
it will be said to them enter the gates of hell to abide therein forever
how wretched is the residence of the arrogant
and those who feared their lord will be driven to paradise in throngs
when they reach it its gates are opened and its keepers will say to them ‘ peace be upon you
peace be upon you
enter paradise to abide therein forever
they will say “ all praise is due to us and his promise to us and we will settle our forefathers in paradise wherever we will
how excellent is the reward of those who laboured
and you will see the angels surrounding the throne exalting with their lord
and it will be judged between them with justice and it will be said all praise be to allah the lord of the worlds
hameem alphabets of the arabic language allah – and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of the book is from allah the mighty the knower
the forgiver of sin the accepter of repentance the stern in retribution
there is no god but he to him is the homecoming
none disputes concerning allah except the faithless
so do not be misled by their bustle in the land deceive you
the people of noah before them also belied and the factions after them every nation purposed to seize the messenger of allah and disputed against them with false arguments to refute the truth and so that they may conceal the truth
so i seized them and how was my retribution
thus has the word of your lord been realized against the unbelievers that they are destined to be inmates of the fire
those who bear the throne and those who are round the praises of their lord and believe in him and ask forgiveness for those who believe in him and ask forgiveness for the believers saying our lord
you embrace all things in mercy and knowledge
so forgive those who repent and follow your way and save them from the punishment of hell
our lord admit them to gardens of eden which you have promised them and those who have gone before their fathers and their wives and their offspring
you are the almighty the wise
and guard them against all ills
and whomever you protect from evils on that day you have mercy on him that is the supreme triumph ’
verily those who disbelieve will enter the fire when it is said unto them this is more grievous than your abhorrence
you were invited to faith when you were called to belief
they will say our lord twice you made us die and twice you have given us life so we confess our sins and twice have we confess our sins
it will be said “ this is because when allah was invoked you disbelieved but when others were associated others with allah you believed
so the judgement belongs to allah the allexalted the allgreat ’
it is he who shows you his signs and sends down sustenance from the sky and sends down from every living creature who repents and turns to him
so call upon god with exclusive devotion to him even though the unbelievers resent it
exalter of ranks owner of the throne he sendeth down the spirit of his command upon whomsoever he will of his servants he will give warning to the day of encounter
the day when they will emerge from their graves nothing will be concealed from allah
allah s is the one the prevailing
that day every soul will be recompensed for what it earned
no injustice today
indeed allah is swift at reckoning
warn them of the day of the impending calamity when the hearts will be choking with the throats filling them
the wrongdoers will have no friend nor intercessor to help themselves
he knows the covert glance and what the hearts conceal
allah judges with justice while those they invoke besides him can not judge anything at all
indeed allah is hearing and seeing
have they not travelled in the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those before them
they were greater than them in strength and left firmer traces in the land
so allah seized them for their sins
and they had no protector from allah and they had no protector
that was because their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they disbelieved so allah seized them
indeed he is allstrong severe in retribution
and indeed we sent moosa with our signs and a clear proof
to pharaoh haman and qarun but they said ‘ a mendacious sorcerer ’
so when he brought them the truth from us they said kill the sons of those who believe with him and spare their women
but the plot of the disbelievers is in naught but error
pharaoh said let me kill moses and let him call to his lord
i fear that he may change your religion or that he may cause corruption in the land
moses said i seek refuge in my lord and your lord from every arrogant person who does not believe in the day of reckoning
and a believing man of pharaoh s folk who hid his faith said would you kill a man because he says my lord is allah
he has brought you clear signs from your lord
if he is a liar his lie will recoil back on him but if he is truthful then some of what he promises you will befall you
allah does not guide the extravagant imposter
o my people today the kingdom is yours who will make you superior to us in the land but if i turn to you the pharaoh s pharaoh will say i only guide you to the right path
and the man who believed said o my people i fear for you the like of the day of the confederates
like the fate of those who were before them and the people of noah
allah does not want injustice for his servants and allah does not want injustice to his servants
o my people i fear for you the day of calling
the day when you will turn your backs fleeing from allah
and whomever allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
and assuredly joseph had come unto you with clear proofs yet ye ceased not to doubt concerning that which he brought you until he died while ye said allah will not break his messenger until he died
until when he died you said allah will never send after him
thus allah leads astray the doubter
those who dispute concerning the signs of allah without any authority
that is because allah has granted them faith and has increased in the faith
thus does allah seal up the heart of every arrogant tyrant
and pharaoh said haman build me a tower that i may reach the ways
the ways of moses in the heavens and the earth i see that i may see the liars
thus it was made fairseeming to firaun s people ’
pharaoh was not a transgressing lot
and we gave him the lie to his master but he refused to go on
and he who believed said o my people follow me i will guide you to the path of rectitude
o my people the life of this world is ephemeral but the hereafter is the abode of the hereafter
whosoever worketh an evil deed shall not be requited except with a like manner of good
but whosoever worketh righteously or male or female and is a believer such shall enter paradise and shall enter paradise and shall be provided for him who can not be provided with a reckoning
my people what is the matter with me when i call you to salvation and you call me to the fire
you call me to disbelieve in allah and associate with him that which i have no knowledge and i call you to the allmighty the allforgiving
there is no doubt that you call me to worship in this world or in the hereafter
and to allah return and almusrifun ie the arrogants are the dwellers of the fire
you will remember what i say to you
i confide my affair with god
indeed allah watches his servants ’
so allah protected him from the evils of their scheming and the evil of pharaoh took revenge on the day of the clan of fir aun pharaoh s clan ’
the fire they are exposed to it morning and evening and when the hour sets in the morning they will be told “ admit the clan of pharaoh to the severest punishment ”
and when they will quarrel between the weak will say to the arrogant leaders ‘ we were your followers ’
so do you take a portion of the fire against us you have no strength to avert from us
those who were arrogant will say “ all of us are in it
allah has already judged between his servants
and those in the fire will say to the keepers of hell supplicate your lord to lighten for us a day of a day whereon the chastisement will be established
they will say did not your messengers come to you with clear proofs
they will say yes they will say
they will say “ then pray ” but the prayer of the disbelievers is only in error
verily we shall help our messengers and those who believe in this life and on the day when the witnesses rise
the day when their excuses will not profit the harmdoers
theirs will be the curse and theirs shall be the evil abode
and we gave moses the guidance and we bequeathed the children of israel
a guidance and a reminder for men of understanding
so be patient
the promise of allah is true
and ask forgiveness of your lord and glorify him with praise and celebrate the praise of your lord morning
indeed those who dispute concerning the signs of allah without any authority having come to them there is no harm in their breasts except when they come to you in outward pride
so seek refuge in allah indeed he is the allhearing the allseeing
indeed the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind but most people do not know
and the blind and the sighted are not equal nor are those who believe and do good works and the evildoer
little is the admonition that you reflect
the hour is coming no doubt about it but most people do not believe
your lord has said call me to you and i will answer your prayers
indeed those who disdain my worship will enter hell disgraced
it is allah who made the night for you to rest and the day to see
indeed allah is gracious to mankind but most people do not give thanks
such is allah your lord the creator of all things
there is no god but he
wither then are ye turned away
thus are they perverted who deny the signs of allah
it is allah who made the earth a habitat for you and the sky a canopy and moulded you good things
such is allah your lord the creator of the universe and he is allah the lord of the worlds
blessed is allah the lord of the worlds
he is the living
there is no god but he
all praise to allah lord of the worlds
say “ i have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides allah when clear signs have come to me from my lord and i am commanded to submit ”
it is he who created you from dust then from a spermdrop then from a clot then brings you forth a child then he develops you of a child
and if you attain your duty towards him then you will come before you
of all things there is he who appointed for you an appointed term so that you may understand
he it is who gives life and causes death
when he decrees a thing he only says to it be and it is
have you not seen those who dispute concerning the signs of allah how they are turned away
those who deny the book and what we sent our messengers and what we sent with our messengers they will come to know
when carcans are iron collars and chains they will be dragged
in the boiling water then into the fire they will be consumed
then it will be said to them where are those you used to worship
other than allah they will reply they have gone astray from us
nay but we did not call upon before this in fact allah sends the disbelievers astray
this is because you used to rejoice in the earth without right and because you used to rejoice
enter the gates of hell to abide therein forever
evil is the lodging of the proud
so be patient
the promise of allah is true
whether we show you some of what we promise them or we show you some of our sins and you will be returned to us
we sent messengers before you and some we have already told you of whose account we have not narrated to you
it was not for any messenger to bring a miracle unless allah dispensed
so when the command of allah comes justly the decree of judgement will come and the vaindoers will be lost
it is allah who has appointed for you the cattle that you ride and some of them you eat
and many uses in them are your hearts
and they are upon the land and beasts and hosts which ye come upon them and upon them and upon ships you are borne
he shows you his signs
which then of the tokens of allah will ye deny
have they not travelled in the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those before them
they were more numerous than they and left behind them in the land
but their earnings did not avail them
and when their messengers came to them with clear signs they were rejoicing in what they had been given to them
so they were besieged by what they used to deride
so when they saw our punishment they said we believe in allah alone and reject all that we used to associate with him
but their faith did not avail them when they saw our punishment
this is the way of allah which he has chosen for his servants
and the disbelievers courted utter loss
hameem alphabets of the arabic language allah – and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
a revelation from the most merciful the most merciful
a book whose verses are detailed a quran for people who know
this is a bearer of glad tidings and a warner but most of them turn away so they are disregardful
they say our hearts are veiled from that to which you call us to and in our ears is deafness and between us and you there is a veil
so act as you are a veil
so work as you will and we will
say i am only a mortal like you
it has been revealed to me that your god is one god
so woe to almushrikun the idolaters and ask him for forgiveness
who do not pay zakah and who do not believe in the hereafter
as for those who believe and do good works theirs shall be a hire honourable
say do you disbelieve in him who created the earth in two days and attribute to him equals
that is the lord of the worlds
he placed mountains firmly rooted in it and blessed it and he ordained therein its sustenance in four days and measured it in four days
then he turned to the heaven while it was smoke
and the heaven and the earth said come we willingly or unwillingly
then he completed them seven heavens in two days and he revealed to each heaven its appointed law
and we adorned the lower heaven with lamps and preserve them
that is the determination of the almighty the allknowing
but if they turn away say “ i warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of a ad and thamud ”
when the messengers came to them from before them saying worship none but allah and his messenger saying had our lord willed he would have sent down angels
we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent
as for ad they were arrogant in the land without right and said who is mightier than us
did they not see that allah who created them was mightier than they in strength
and they denied our signs
so we unleashed upon them a screaming wind in days inauspicious that we might make them taste the punishment of humiliation in the life of this world
and the chastisement of the hereafter is more shameful and they will not be helped
as for thamood we guided them but they preferred blindness to guidance so the thunderbolt of the thunderbolt seized them for what they were earning
and we saved those who believed and feared allah
and remember the day when allah s enemies ’ are herded into the fire forcibly and they are in check
until when they reach it their hearing and their skins and their skins will testify against them concerning what they used to do
and they will say to their skins why did you bear witness against us
they will say “ god gave us speech and god gave all things
it is he who created you the first time and to him you will be returned
you did not hide yourselves lest your hearing and your sight and your skins should testify against you but you thought that allah did not know much of what you do
that thought of yours which ye thought about your lord hath ruined you and ye have become of the losers
so if they are patient and their abode is hell
they will not be allowed to ask allah for forgiveness
we have assigned them comrades in the world and the decked out fair to them
and the word of punishment has passed on before them and that they will be justified against the jinn
they were indeed losers
the unbelievers say do not listen to this koran and talk idly about it haply you will overcome
we will surely make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment and we will repay them in the worst of what they used to do
that is the recompense of allah s enemies ’ for them is the fire of eternity as a recompense for their denying our signs
those who disbelieve will say our lord show us those who led us astray and make them succeed they become among the lowest
indeed those who say our lord is allah and then remain seated upon them descend the angels descend on them saying fear not nor grieve
receive the glad tidings of the garden which you have been promised
we are your friends in this world and in the hereafter and in the hereafter you will have whatever your souls desire and you will have therein whatever you call for
a gift from one the forgiving the merciful
and who is better in speech than he who calls to allah and says i am of the muslims
and good deeds are not equal repel evil with good and you will be like one whom is in the fairer and he will attain between you and you will be like a helper
but none attains it except those who are patient and none is granted it except the owner of a great happiness
and if an evil whisper from satan should provoke you seek refuge in allah indeed allah is hearing knowing
and of his signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon
do not prostrate yourselves before the sun nor the moon but prostrate to allah who created them if it is him that you worship
but if they wax proud to do so then those who are too proud to glorify your lord night and day and do not grow weary
and of his signs is that you see the earth
and we send down water upon him from the sky and when we send down water upon it
surely he who revives it will revive the dead
indeed he is over all things competent
those who blaspheme our revelations are not hidden from us
is he who will be cast into the fire better or he who comes secure on the day of resurrection
he is seeing of what you do
those who disbelieve in the reminder when it comes to them it is a book that has been given to them
falsehood can not approach it from before it or from behind it
it is a revelation from the wise the praiseworthy
nothing is said to you except what was said to the messengers before you
verily your lord is the possessor of forgiveness and the possessor of painful punishment
and had we made it a quran they would have said why is it not a sign for us
and a revelation is a foreign recitation and an arab
say it is for those who believe a guidance and cure
and those who believe not in their ears is heaviness and it is the blindness of the quran
they are like a <unk> <unk>
and we gave moses the book but disputes arose concerning it
and had it not been for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been judged between them and they would have been in the grave
they are in disquieting doubt about it
whosoever worketh righteously it is for his own soul and whosoever worketh righteously it is against it
your lord does not wrong his servants
no female beareth not the knowledge of the hour nor doth he be absent from their lord
on the day when he will call to them where are my partners they will say ‘ ‘ ‘ where are they not used to call you ’
and they used to worship before them and they will find no escape for them
man does not weary of praying for good things but if evil assails him he is despondent despairing
and if we let him taste mercy from us after affliction has touched him he says this is my due
i do not think the hour will ever come
and if i am brought back to my lord i will surely have the best reward with him
we will surely inform those who disbelieve and we will make them taste a severe punishment
when we bestow favor upon man he turns away but when evil befalls him he turns away and goes away in full
say o muhammad saw tell me if it is from allah and you disbelieve in it who is further astray than he who is in extreme error
we will show them our signs in the horizons and in their souls until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth
is it not sufficient that your lord is witness over everything
lo they are in doubt about the meeting with their lord
he comprehends everything
hameem alphabets of the arabic language allah – and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
ayn seen qaf
thus allah the mighty the knower inspireth thee and those before thee
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
he is allhigh and supreme
the heavens wellnigh rent asunder from above them
and the angels hallow the praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for them
lo allah is forgiving merciful
and those who take protectors besides him allah is warden over them and you are not a manager over them
thus we have revealed to you an arabic qur an ’ in arabic and that you may warn the people of the book and those who are in the arabic language and those who disbelieve in the last day and those who disbelieve will be in hell
had allah wished he could have made them one community but he admits whomever he wills into his mercy
and the wrongdoers have no protector or helper
or have they taken protectors besides him
but he is the protecting friend of the dead and he is the protector
he is able to do all things
whatever you differ about its judgement rests with god
such is allah my lord in him i put my trust and to him i turn in repentance
the creator of the heavens and the earth he has made for you mates from yourselves and pairs of cattle and pairs of you
no like him is like him
he is the hearer the seer
to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth
he enlargeth providence for whom he will and straiteneth it for whom he will
he is allknowing allaware
he has prescribed for you the religion which he has enjoined upon noah and which we have revealed to you and that which we have revealed to abraham and moses and jesus and jesus and moses and jesus and jesus and jesus and jesus and he enjoined upon abraham
and that thou shouldst be hard unto them
allah chooses for himself whom he wills and guides to himself whoever turns to him
they did not split up except after knowledge had come to them out of jealous animosity between themselves
and if not for a word that preceded from your lord postponing it would have been decreed between them
and those who inherited the book after them are in disquieting doubt about it
so be patient o muhammad saw and be constant in your claim to be ordered
and say “ i have not been sent down by the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and the injeel gospel and i have been commanded to be sent down to you in religion ”
allah is our lord and your lord
we are our deeds and for you your deeds
there is no quarrel between us and you
allah will bring us together and to him is the final destination
and those who dispute concerning allah after his call has been acknowledged their argument is invalid with their lord
theirs shall be a torment afflictive
it is allah who has sent down the book with the truth and the balance
and what will make you know perhaps the hour is near
those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it but those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth
verily those who dispute concerning the hour are in error far astray
allah is subtle and kind to his slaves
he is the allstrong the allmighty
whoever desires the harvest of the hereafter we increase for him his harvest and whoever desires the harvest of this world we give him thereof and he has no share in the hereafter
or do they have partners who have appointed for them a religion which allah has not permitted them
and had it not been for a word that had already been decreed for them all would have been settled
indeed for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment
you will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned and it will befall them for what they used to earn
and those who believe and do good deeds will surely come to them with a fine reward
that is the supreme success of their lord
that is the good news that allah gives to his servants who believe and do good deeds
say o muhammad saw i ask of you no wage for this except for those of you who do good works and add increase for him
indeed allah is forgiving and appreciative
allah is forgiving responsive
or do they say he has forged a lie against allah
if allah willed he could seal your heart
allah wipes out falsehood and verifies the truth by his words
he is knower of that which is in the breasts
and it is he who accepts repentance from his servants and forgives sins and knows what you do
and he answers the prayers of those who believe and do good deeds and increases them from his bounty
but for the unbelievers there is a terrible punishment
and if allah were to enlarge his bondmen they would not act righteously in the earth but he sends down out of his servants and he sends down provision for his servants
and it is he who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads abroad his mercy
he is the protecting friend the praiseworthy
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and all that he has spread out for them
and he is allpotent over their assembling
whatever misfortune befalls you is because of what your hands have earned
he forgiveth much
you are not able to frustrate him on earth and you have no protector or helper besides allah
and of his signs are the ships that sail in the sea like mountains
if he willed he could have stilled the winds so that they would be stranded on its surface indeed in that are signs for every patient grateful person
or he could wreck them for what they have earned and he pardons much
and those who dispute concerning our signs know that there is no asylum for them
whatever thing you have been given is but the wares of the life of this world and the hereafter is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their lord
and those who avoid the major sins and indecencies and forgive when angered
and those who answer their lord and whose affair is acceptable unto him and establish prayer and who spend of that wherewith we have provided them
and those who when they are wronged themselves tyrants
the guerdon of an illdeed is an evil like thereof
but whosoever pardoneth and amendeth his reward is due from him
indeed he does not like the wrongdoers
and whoever avenges himself after he has been wronged there is no way of blame against them
blame is only against those who oppress men and wrongfully rebel in the earth
for such there is a painful punishment
and whosoever patiently endured and forgiveth that is true constancy
he whom allah leads astray has no protector
you will see the harmdoers when they see the punishment saying is there any way back
you will see them exposed to it cowering with concealed eyes and looking with stealthy glance
those who believe will say verily the losers are they who lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection
lo verily the wrongdoers will be in a lasting torment
they will have no protectors to help them besides allah
and whomsoever allah sendeth astray for him there is no way
respond to your lord before there comes a day from allah which can not be averted on that day you will have no refuge nor any intercessor
but if they turn away from you o muhammad saw we have not sent you as a guardian over them
your task is only to convey the message
and when we let man taste mercy from us he rejoices in it but if a misfortune befalls him he rejoices in consequence for what his hands have forwarded then verily man is ungrateful
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he creates whatever he wills he bestows female offspring upon whomever he wills and bestows male offspring upon whomever he wills
or he combines them males and females and females and he renders whomever he wills sterile
he is allknowing allpowerful
it is not a human being to speak to him except that he may reveal to his command unless he wills a messenger from behind or a veil or that he sends down by his leave to reveal what he wills
thus we revealed to you o muhammad saw a spirit from our command
you did not know what the book was nor what is it we guide those of our servants whom we will to walk
and you o muhammad saw guide to a straight path
the path of allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
unquestionably to allah all matters are returned
hameem alphabets of the arabic language allah – and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
by the clear book
we have made it an arabic qur an that you may understand
and it is in the source of decrees allauh almahfuz before us sublime and wise
shall we turn away from you because you are a people musrifun transgressing
how many a prophet we sent to the ancients
and never came a prophet to them but they used to mock him
so we destroyed those who were mightier in courage than these
the example of the ancients has passed away
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will say “ who created them ”
who made the earth a bed for you and made for you ways of life in it ways and that you may find your way
who sends down water from the sky in a measured manner that we revived thereby
likewise will you be raised from the dead
and who created all the pairs and appointed for you ships and cattle and appointed for you
that you may sit on their backs and then remember the favor of your lord when you are seated upon them and say glory be to him who has subjected it not been for us we would have been able to have been able to have been able to
indeed to our lord we will return
yet they have assigned to him a portion of his servants
man is indeed a manifest ingrate
or has he taken to himself daughters out of what he has created daughters and he has selected you with sons
and when one of them is given the news of what he ascribes to the most merciful his face is darkened and he chokes inwardly
are they equal in likeness of one who is brought up to allah and is in outward disputes
and they appoint the angels who are servants of the beneficent females
did they witness their creation
their testimony will be written down and they will be questioned
they say had the merciful willed we would not have worshipped them
they have no knowledge of that
they do not know
or have we given them a book before this so that they are holding fast thereto
nay they say we found our fathers following a religion and we are guided on their footsteps
and similarly we sent not a warner before you o muhammad saw to a township but the luxurious ones said we found our fathers following a religion and we are following their footprints
he said even though i bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following
they said we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent
so we wreaked vengeance upon them
so see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters
and when abraham said to his father and his people i am quit of what you worship
except him who originated me and he will guide me
and he made it a word lasting among his posterity so that they may return
nay but i gave enjoyment until the truth and their fathers until there came to them the truth and a messenger
but when the truth came to them they said this is magic and we disbelieve in it
they said why was this qur an not sent down to some great man of the two towns
is it they who allocate the mercy of your lord
it is we who have distributed among them their livelihood in this world and raised some of them above others in rank that they may make some others submissive to allah
and your lord s mercy is better than what they amass
and were it not that mankind would be one community we would have made for those who disbelieve in the most merciful roofs of silver and stairs of silver whereby they would climb on their houses and silver stairs for mounting
and doors to their houses and couches of silver on which they recline
and ornaments of gold
verily these are the enjoyments of the life of this world and the hereafter with your lord is but an excellent helper
and whosoever blindeth himself to the remembrance of the merciful we assign unto him an ally and shaitan satan
and indeed they bar them from the way of allah and they think they are rightly guided
until when he comes to us he will say would that there were between me and you the distance of the east and the west between me and you would surely be the distance between the two armies
how evil a companion
it will not profit you today since you did
you are partners in the suffering
can you make the deaf listen or guide the blind and the deaf to the right way
and if we take you away we will wreak vengeance upon them
or show you what we promise them for we threaten them
we have perfect wisdom upon them
so hold fast to what has been revealed to you
you are on a straight path
and verily it is a reminder for you and your people and your people and you will be questioned
ask those of our messengers whom we sent before you have sent before you should we have appointed gods for the most beneficent allah
and indeed we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his establishment and he said i am a messenger of the lord of the worlds
but when he brought them our signs they laughed at them
and there was not a sign in the past but we seized them with a terrible punishment so that they may return
they said “ o sorcerer pray to your lord for us according to what has made for us and we will surely be guided ”
but when we removed from them the punishment behold they broke their promise
and pharaoh proclaimed among his people saying o my people is not mine enough for me and these rivers flow beneath me
am i not better than this wretch who can barely express himself
why have no armlets of gold been sent down upon him or angels sent down successively with him
so he incited his people to levity and they obeyed him
they were a wicked people
so when they roused our wrath we took retribution from them and drowned them all
and we made them a thing past and an example for the later folk
and when the son of mary was cited as an example behold your people turn away from it
and they said “ are our gods better or he guided you ”
they are a contentious people
he was just a servant whom we bestowed upon him and made him an example for the children of israel
had we willed we would have made angels to be your successors on earth
and verily he iesa jesus is iesa jesus son of maryam mary
so follow me and follow me this is the straight way
and let not satan divert you
he is your manifest enemy
when jesus came with clear signs he said i have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you what you differ about
so fear allah and obey me
indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him
this is the straight way ”
but the factions differed among themselves
woe to the wrongdoers for the suffering of a painful day
are they looking for aught else than the hour to overtake them suddenly when they are unaware
friends on that day will be foes one to another except the godfearing
o my servants no fear shall be on you today nor shall you grieve
those who believed in our signs and were muslims
enter paradise joyfully and your wives
passed round will be passed around them vessels of gold and cups
therein is whatever the souls desire and delights the eyes
you will abide therein
this is the paradise you have been made to inherit for what you used to do
therein you will have abundant fruits for you
but the sinners will dwell forever in the torment of hell
it will not be lightened for them and they will be plunged in it
we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
and they will call out o malik let your lord put a successor on us
we have brought you the truth but most of you are averse to the truth
or have they devised a scheme and we too devised a plan
or do they think that we do not hear their secret talks and their whispering counsels
yes indeed our messengers are with them writing down
say if the merciful had a son i would have been the first of the merciful
glorified be the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the throne from all that they ascribe unto him
so leave them alone to plunge and play until they encounter the day of theirs which they are promised
it is allah who is allah in the heavens and the earth
he is allwise allknowing
blessed is he who holds the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
and to him you will be returned
those whom they call upon besides him have no power to intercede except with allah s knowledge and those who testify to the truth
if you ask them who created them they will say allah
so where are they being led astray
and his plaint “ my lord these are a people who do not believe ”
so turn away from them and say peace
but they will come to know
hameem alphabets of the arabic language allah – and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
by the clear book
we revealed it in a blessed night and we warn
in it are distributed all affairs
as a command from us we are sending
a mercy from your lord
he is the hearer the knower
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you are believers
there is no god but he
he gives life and causes death
he is your lord and the lord of your forefathers of yore
nay but they play in doubt
so watch for the day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke
enveloping people
it will be a painful punishment
o our lord remove the chastisement from us we will surely believe
how will there be for them a reminder when an apostle has already come to them but a manifest messenger
but they turned away from him saying he is tutored mad
we will remove the punishment for a while you will revert
on the day when we shall seize them with the greatest assault we shall surely take retribution
and assuredly we tried before them and a noble messenger came unto pharaoh
saying restore to me the servants of allah
i am a trustworthy messenger to you
and do not exalt yourselves against allah
i have come to you with a manifest authority
i seek refuge in my lord and your lord lest you should stone me
but if you do not believe me then leave me alone
then he called to his lord saying these are a sinful people
allah said depart with my servants by night
you will be pursued
and leave the sea behind
they are indeed a host to be drowned
how many gardens and springs did they leave behind
and fields and stately mansions
and comforts they used to enjoy
thus it was and we made another people inherit them
neither the heavens nor the earth wept for them nor were they reprieved
and we saved the children of israel from the humiliating punishment
from pharaoh
he was a tyrant among the transgressors
and we chose them over all the worlds
and we gave them signs in which there was a manifest trial
these are saying
there is nothing but our first death and we shall not be raised again
bring back our forefathers if you are truthful
are they better or the people of tubba and those before them
and those who were destroyed by the tribe of a ad and thamud
we destroyed them
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
we created them not save with truth but most of them know not
the day of judgement is the tryst for them all
the day when a friend will not avail a friend nor will they be helped
and he who would protect him
except those upon whom allah has mercy
he is the mighty the merciful
the tree of zaqqum
is the food of the guilty
like dregs of oil it will boil in their bellies
like the boiling of scalding water
seize him and drag him into the midst of hell
then pour over his head the suffering of scalding water
taste
verily you are the mighty the noble
this is what you used to doubt
verily the godfearing shall be in a station secure
amidst gardens and springs
dressed in fine silk and brocade sitting face to face
so it will be and we will we d them to houris virgins
they will call therein for every kind of fruit in security
they will not taste death therein except the first death and he will guard them against the chastisement of the fire
a bounty from your lord
that is the supreme success
we have made it easy in your language so that they may remember
so wait they too are waiting
hameem alphabets of the arabic language allah – and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of the book is from allah the mighty the wise
verily in the heavens and the earth are signs for the believers
and in your creation and in the crawling things he scatters abroad in them are signs for a people who are certain
and in the alternation of night and day and in the provision of allah sends down from the sky and the earth after it is dead for people who understand
these are the verses of allah which we recite to you in truth
in which message we revealed to you and his signs they will believe
woe to every sinful liar
who hears the verses of allah recited to him and then persists arrogantly as if he had not heard them
so announce to him a painful punishment
and when he learns something of our signs he takes them in mockery
for such there is a shameful punishment
behind them is hell before them and what they have earned will not avail them other than allah
for them is a great punishment
this is guidance
those who disbelieve in the signs of their lord will have a painful punishment
it is allah who subjected to you the sea that he may sail at his command and subjected for you the ships and the sea
that you may be grateful
and he has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth all is from him
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
say o muhammad saw to those who believe do not expect the days of allah for the days of a people for what they used to earn
that is so for all people he does not have power to bring them back
and whosoever worketh righteously it is for his soul and whosoever worketh evil it is against it
then to your lord you will be returned
and we gave the children of israel the book and the wisdom and prophethood and the prophethood and we provided them with good things and preferred them above all beings
and we gave them clear signs
they differed not except after the knowledge had come to them through envy among themselves
verily your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
then we set you on a clear road of our command so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know
so follow this and do not follow the desires of those who do not know
verily they will not avail thee at all against allah
the wrongdoers are allies of one another but god is the friend of the godfearing
this quran is a lesson for mankind and a guidance and mercy for a people who have faith
or do those who commit misdeeds suppose that we will make them equal to those who believe and do good deeds and persist in their life and death will be equal in this life how evil is the judgement for them
allah created the heavens and the earth with truth and that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned and they will not be wronged
have you seen him who has taken his caprice to his own desire and god has led him astray knowingly over his hearing and his heart and has sealed over his heart and has sealed on his sight and has put a veil
who will guide him after allah
so he who disbelieves further astray
will you not then heed
they say there is no more than our present life and we die and live and we live for our destruction but the time of life
they have no knowledge of this and they are only conjecturing
they have no knowledge of it
and when our clear verses are recited to them their argument is to say bring back our fathers if you are truthful
say ‘ allah gives you life and causes you to die ’
then he will gather you to the dead and you will gather you together on the day of resurrection but most people do not know
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
and on the day when the hour riseth the falsifiers will lose
and you will see every nation fallen on their knees
every nation shall be summoned to its record
it will be said this day you will be recompensed for what you used to do
this our record speaks about you with truth
verily
we have been recording all that you used to do ’
as for those who believed and did good deeds their lord will admit them into his mercy
that is the manifest triumph
but as for those who disbelieved it will be said were not our verses recited to you but you were arrogant and you were a people who were mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals sinners etc
when it was said ‘ allah s promise ’ is indeed true and there is no doubt about the hour ’ he said ‘ we do not know what the hour is in grave we do not know ’ ’
the evils of what they did will appear to them and they will be besieged by what they used to deride
and it will be said “ today we will forget you forgot the meeting of this day of yours and your refuge is the fire
and none will help you against allah
that is because you took the revelations of allah scoffingly and the life of the world deceived you
so today they will not be brought out of it nor will they be suffered to please allah
all praise belongs to allah lord of the heavens and the earth lord of the worlds
his is the glory in the heavens and the earth
he is the mighty the wise
hameem alphabets of the arabic language allah – and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the revelation of the book is from allah the mighty the wise
we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth and for an appointed term
but those who disbelieve are disregardful of that whereof they are warned
say o muhammad saw o muhammad saw tell me what you invoke besides allah show me what they have created
or do they have any partnership in the heavens
bring me a scripture before this or some trace of knowledge if you are truthful
who is more astray than he who calls upon other than allah and who can not answer him till the day of resurrection when they are unaware of their invocation
and when mankind are gathered together they will become their enemies and will become deniers of the fire
and when our clear messages are recited to them the unbelievers say of the truth when it reacheth them this is magic manifest
or do they say he has fabricated it
say if i have fabricated it you have no power to help me against allah
he is best aware of what you say
he is the forgiving the most merciful
say i am not a human being
and do not know that the tradition of my lord is with me nor do you know that the matter of your lord is not answerable for you nor do you be held back except with me
i only follow what is revealed to me and i am only a clear warner ”
say “ tell me if this qur an is from allah and you disbelieve in it and some of the children of israel believe in it and you are like the like of it ”
indeed allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot ’
and those who disbelieve say of those who believe if it had been good they would not have been better guided us they would not have been guided
and before it was a book of musa moses and a mercy
this is a book confirming what was revealed to the wrongdoers and give good news to the doers of good
indeed those who say our lord is allah and thereafter remained steadfast there shall be no fear concerning them nor shall they grieve
such are rightful owners of the garden immortal therein as a reward for what they used to do
we have enjoined man to be kind to his parents his mother carries him in pain
his bearing witness and weaning him in travail
until when he reaches maturity he says my lord enable me to appreciate the child and to give me good for your favor and to do righteous good deeds which you have bestowed upon me and give me a righteous child
indeed i have turned to you and my parents
i am of those who surrender unto you
those are they from whom we accept the best of what they do and overlook their evil deeds they are among the inhabitants of paradise a promise which they were promised
but he who says to his parents fie upon you both
do you threaten me that i will be raised up again when generations have passed away before me and they will be resurrected for allah s sake ’ when they have said “ woe to you ”
but he says this is nothing but fables of the ancients
such are they against whom the word of punishment has come upon nations of jinn and humans that have passed away before them
they are the losers
for all are degrees according to what they have done and he will repay them in full for their deeds and they will not be wronged
and on the day when the unbelievers are exposed to the fire you have exhausted your good things in the life of the world and enjoyed them and you took enjoyment in the earth for your pleasure and your garments desiring the good things you were arrogant
and mention o muhammad of the brother of ad when he warned his people had warners before him and warners had passed away before him saying serve none but allah
i fear for you the chastisement of a dreadful day
they said have you come to turn us away from our gods
then bring us what you threaten us with if you are truthful
he said “ the knowledge of it rests with god
i convey to you the message that i convey to you but i see that you are a people who are ignorant
then when they saw it as a dense cloud coming toward their valleys they said this is a cloud that will bring us rain
nay but it is that which you were impatient for which you were impatient for a wind wherein is a painful punishment
it will destroy everything by the command of its lord so they became empty
thus do we requite the guilty lot
and if he is one of those who are the right
and peace be upon you from your right hand
but if he is of the truthful and the liars
will be the hot boiling water
in scorching fire
this is indeed a true story
then proclaim the purity of your lord
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols allah s glory
<unk>
to him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he gives life and causes death and he is able to do all things
he is the first and the last and the manifest
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days then he mounted the heavens and the earth
he knows what penetrates into the earth and what comes out of it and what descends from the sky
and he is with you wherever you may be
and allah is allseer of what you do
to him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and to him is referred
he makes the night pass into the day and he knows what is in the night
spend in allah s cause and his messenger and spend of your wealth and children
those of you who believe and do not give any reward for them awaits a mighty wage
what is the matter with you that you believe in allah and if you are believers
it is he who sends down clear signs to his votary
indeed allah is ever merciful to you
what is the matter with you that you spend in the way of allah whereas to allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth
and the like of the generations before you
and their wealth will come upon them in addition
but allah knows best their best
and allah is allaware of what you do
who is he who gives his wealth to allah a good loan he will multiply it for him manifold
you will see the right and left their light on that day
and it will be said unto them this day ye shall live for ever
“ and you will abide therein ”
that is the supreme success
the day when the hypocrites both men and the hypocritical women will say to the believers wait we are your enemies
they will be told ‘ enjoy your pleasure ’
a wave will be <unk> between them and a gate of pure mercy
they will say “ were we not with you ”
they will say “ you are tempted by the enemy of allah but you tempted the evil intentions and satan deceived you in the way of allah ”
so today no ransom will be accepted from you nor will the disbelievers be accepted
and the earth
it is he who created you
what an evil restingplace
and the qur an ’ is sent down to allah s inspiration ’ and when the hearts of the people of the book came to them and do not believe in some days and some of them do not even as they were defiantly disobedient
unquestionably it is allah who gives life to the earth after its lifelessness
we have made clear to you the revelations so that you may understand
the charitable men and women who spend their freewill offerings and their families a fine reward and a fine reward and a generous reward
and whosoever believe in allah and his messenger and whosoever he will be the rightly guided by his lord they are the rightly guided
for them is their own tongues and their own hands
and those who disbelieve and belied our revelations these will be the fellows of the fire
know that the life of this world is nothing but play and diversion and boasting among you with wealth and children
this is a likeness of a people who have drawn away from it
then he became of the spectacle and his heart
then he makes them easy in the gardens and forgiveness and a painful punishment
the life of this world is but a merchandise of vanity
race in forgiveness from your lord and from the sky and the earth prepared for those who believe in allah and his messenger
that is the grace of allah which he bestows on whom he wills
allah is the possessor of immense grace
no affliction befalls you except that is in the earth or in the earth except that it is we who create it
that is easy for allah
he thus clarifies his revelations for you that you may be thankful
allah does not burden a man who does not know
who enjoin upon mankind what is mean and enjoin upon mankind
so whosoever turns away from the truth allah has indeed turned away
and we revealed to abraham and his mother that she should be guided and be not with them
we have cast the tablets and the vision of the people in order that we might try him with the great assault and that allah is the hearer the knower
indeed allah is the allstrong the immensely praiseworthy
and we sent noah and abraham and placed in their line prophethood and the book
and some of them are guided but many of them are transgressors
then we sent following after their footsteps jesus son of mary after they had been laden with noah
and they followed him compassion and mercy from them
so we made it proper for them so they do not sell it for him
so we gave those of them who believed their wage
but many of them are transgressors
so believe and fear god and his messenger he will give you a twofold portion of his mercy and will appoint for you a light
allah is forgiving merciful
so it is so that they may know that allah s bounty is over the possessor of allah
allah is the possessor of immense grace
lo allah hath heard the speech of her who hath made thee a calumny and an apostle
allah has knowledge of all that you hide
indeed allah is hearing and seeing
those of you who are prodigal at their wives and their mothers are not the mothers are their mothers except their husbands getting them
and they speak untruth about it
allah is pardoning and forgiving
and the women who passed away from their wives after they had been free from the mother of the cattle
this is a reminder for you
and allah is allaware of what you do
but whosoever is not able to fast so he who is a fast by his penance invoking himself before the setting of his soul
that is for you so that you may believe in allah and his messenger
these are the limits of allah for them is a painful punishment
as for those who were taken to god and his messenger as the example of those before them
we have sent down clear signs and for the unbelievers is a humbling chastisement
on the day when allah will resurrect them all together and inform them of what they did
allah has kept them away from their places and they have forgotten the account of the unseen
allah is witness over everything
do you not know that allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
there is no one among the other except him who is behind his mother and his knowledge and he has no knowledge of it except a small price
then to them will be your return whereat they will be returned
allah knows all things
secret counsels that they committed not nor enmity and aggression
and when they come to you they say why do you not say god is gracious to us
hell will be their immortal therein
what an evil destination
o you who believe when you whisper of secret talks and secretly together against the messenger
and fear allah and keep your duty to him who fears allah and fear him
and naught befalleth them in secret but he bringeth them no hurt
in allah let all the trusting put their trust
o you who believe when you are told to make room in the land say to god will give you lodging in the land
when it is said to you rise up to it god will raise those of you who believe to those who have faith and do not know what is given knowledge
and allah is allaware of what you do
o you who believe when you confer in private or talk before you consume it
that is better and more suitable for you
but if you do not know that allah is the forgiver the merciful
do you not know that you offer charities before
if you do so pray to god and give the charity then perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey god
and allah is allaware of what you do
do you not see those who make a lie to the path of allah
they neither belong to you nor to them
they swear by the oaths that they speak
allah has prepared for them a severe punishment
evil is what they used to do
they have taken their oaths as a shield and bar from the way of allah
for them is a shameful punishment
and their wealth and children avail them not aught against allah
they will abide therein forever
on the day when allah will raise them all together they will swear before him as they will swear before him
and they are the liars
satan has made them forget and so remembrance of allah
they are the ones who are accursed
and those who do not know that it is they who are the losers
those who oppose allah and his messenger will be among the most humiliated
allah will say “ i will soon grant me victory and my hair ”
indeed allah is the allstrong the immensely praiseworthy
and those who believe in allah and the last day will not find a group of them who oppose allah and his messenger and the last day and they will not be their intercessors with their hearts
allah has promised those who believe in their faith and their spouses and gardens beneath which rivers flow where they will abide for ever
they will abide therein
allah is wellpleased with them and they are wellpleased with him
they are the party of allah
verily it is they who are the party of allah
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols his glory
he it is who has created the people of the book and the witnessed that their hands will bring out the inner thoughts into the depths of the first time
they thought that they would think they would be their own burden
and allah laid hold of them from whence they lay down upon their hands and their hands by their feet and their feet
o people of understanding
had allah wished that allah would not have taken them in his punishment
and they will be like the torment of the fire
that is because they opposed allah and his messenger and allah is severe in retribution
and the olive cut off early by the palm trees and the palm trees and the moon
and allah maketh whomsoever he will to go on them and ye are on whomsoever he will
allah is able to do all things
and when the messenger of allah comes to pass away from him he is with the enemy of allah and the angels and the last day
the messenger gives you to accept it and avoid it
allah is the forgiver the most merciful
the bedouins who are poor and the needy and the traveller they are not held in the cause of allah and his messenger
these are the truthful ones
and the first forerunners in the city and those who emigrated after the persecuted of their homes and persist in their homes and do not fear them even though they were believers
and whosoever goes astray — such are the successful
and the ones who said “ our lord forgive us and have accepted faith in our hearts and we have accepted faith in our hearts and do not put a rancour towards those who believe ”
and they say to their religion “ if you are given the book s your hearts fight against you we will not fight you against you and if you do not obey you ”
allah is witness that they are liars
if they come to their homes they will not be with you then they will be helped with their faces and if they were to come to them they will not be helped
indeed they fear allah
they are the ones who will stay behind
they are not waiting for you except in the midst of the bridaldue of the prophet
but they were in their transgression
you think they would think that they have become divided while their hearts are divided
that is because they are pure
they are like a little before them and they tasted the evil result of their own ruin
the hypocrites are disbelievers in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and disbelievers saying “ be ”
i fear allah the lord of the worlds
the fire will be in them abiding eternally
that is the recompense of the wrongdoers
o you who believe fear allah and fear allah for you are aware of what you do
and do not be like allah s ’ ’ so do not be like those who are the fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
they are the sinners
not equal are the inhabitants of the fire and the inhabitants of paradise
the inhabitants of paradise will be in <unk>
and if we had sent down this quran upon the mountain you would have become clouds
we put forward to mankind that they may reflect
he is allah the knower of the unseen and the seen
he is allah the one who has given the book the quran the quran the quran
high is allah above all that they associate
he is allah the creator the one who created the heavens and the earth
his are the best names
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols his glory
<unk>
o you who believe do not take the enemy for friends of your own selves
do you believe in god when they come to you the enemy of your lord and they will turn you away from your homeland
if you have come to struggle in my cause seeking to forgive you and to forgive them
and i know of what you conceal and whoever of you does so he who has strayed into error
if they should come to you with their hands and their hands and their hands and feet that you should do not disbelieve
neither can any avail you nor avail you
he will judge between you
and allah is allaware of what you do
and abraham and his mother and his messenger and they said we believe in you and your company and your assembly and we disbelieve in you but we disbelieve in allah alone and his messenger and we do not turn you in your hearts and your lord lest you
our lord
our lord forgive us our sins verily thou art of the ingrates
and for you there is good in the end and the last day
so whosoever turns away from allah
perhaps allah will make friendship between you
allah is the powerful the knower
he forbiddeth you not the religion of your own good and forbiddeth you kindly
verily allah is the allknower of those who make ready for worship
he only forbids you to drive you out of religion and who forbids you from the religion of islam and who has expelled you from your homes
and whosoever takes them for friends these are the wrongdoers
o believers when you are hypocrites to test them and when you test them he loves them
allah is best aware of what they say
and if you do not know them
they are not lawful for them nor are they lawful for them
there is no fault in you if you marry them
and do not give the faithless your wives to be good to them and do not ask for what they earned
that is so
he is your part of the affair
allah is aware of all things
if any of your wives have been to bring you back to your relatives and those who have gone away from what they have spent as booty you have spent on their wives and their hands have been given to the prophet
and fear allah in whom you believe
o you prophet muhammad peace be upon him who had uttered with their mouths and saying anything of their mouths what is in their hands have no power to bring out to you nor to bring out anything from allah nor to remove the evil of their hands
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
o you who believe do not make a way of the messenger of allah superior to the unbelievers who have no hope
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols allah s glory
<unk>
o you who believe why do you profess to you
the evil of you are brought nigh
indeed allah will settle in rows as if they were a solid dawn
and when moses said to his people “ o my people why do you not harm me
i am allah s messenger to you i am a messenger of allah
they were further astray and allah does not guide the transgressing lot
and when eisa said o children of israel i am the messenger of allah to you and i am the messenger of allah to give you the taurat torah and the injeel gospel after me that i may be among the righteous
and they said “ this is obvious magic ”
who is more wicked than he who fabricates a lie against allah
allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
they wish that allah s wrath should be carried out of his light even though the disbelievers get annoyed
it is he who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that he may uplift it above all religions even though the idolaters dislike it
o you who believe
so believe in allah and his messenger and strive in the way of allah with your wealth and lives
that is better for you if you only knew
he will forgive you your sins and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow and excellent mansions
that is the great success
and other than allah that which is behind and that which is behind
so give good news to the orphans
o messenger jesus son of mary said to god “ we will be the helpers of god ”
then a party of the children of israel believed and a party disbelieved
so we strengthened those who believed against their foe so they became dominant
all that is in the heavens and the earth extols the glory of allah
and he it is who sendeth down the revelations of allah unto them and causeth them to grow in vain and lo they were in manifest error
and allah is the protecting friend of those who create you
<unk>
that is the grace of allah which he grants to whomever he wills
allah is the possessor of immense grace
but as for those who were entrusted to it they were not given the book s
how evil is the likeness of those who deny the revelations of allah
allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
say o mankind if you are truthful and the truth say to allah you are truthful
but they will never long for it
and allah is allaware of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
say “ death will come to you
then you will be returned to the knower of the unseen and the seen
he will tell you what you used to do
o you who believe call on the day of friday and call upon the remembrance of allah
that is better for you if you only knew
and establish prayer and give zakah and remember allah much that you may prosper
so when they see you they will not rush you in the morning and their faces have become hard upon you
say “ the worst of god is that i do not possess the good ”
allah is the best knower of things
when they come to you they say we are god s ’
allah knows what you do not know
and allah is the liars
they have taken their oaths as a shield and bar from the way of allah
evil is what they used to do
that is because they disbelieved and then disbelieved after their belief will come to them
you will not speak to them their bodies please you
and they are like a dry faggots
so they will come to know
they are the enemies of allah
you will be told
so how are they turned away from the truth
when it is said to them come you will bring your light into their light and you will see their faces
it is not for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them allah will not forgive them
allah does not guide the transgressing lot
they will say “ do not spend on those who are near to allah s way ’ until they are unwilling ”
and to allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not know
they said if we cease we will surely go to the hypocrites
but the power of allah belongs the unseen but the hypocrites do not know
o you who believe
and those who are the losers
and when death approaches one of you he says “ my lord defer me to a little while i will give sadaqah charity before you and i will give alms and then i will give alms and be among the good doers of good ”
allah will not delay the punishment
and allah is allaware of what you do
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols allah s glory
his is the sovereignty and he is able to do all things
it is he who created you and of you he it is who has created you and of you the faithless
and allah is allaware of what you do
he created the heavens and the earth with truth
to him is the kingdom
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and he knows what you hide
allah is well aware of what you do
like those who disbelieve and what they have done before you is the recompense of what you did
for them is a painful punishment
that is because they have bartered away with their mouths and say why is it not a way to us
they turn away from the <unk>
allah has no right to give them
the faithless pretend when they are in utter loss
say yes by my lord you will surely be raised again and then you will be brought back to life
that is easy for allah
so believe in allah and his angels and all that we have sent down
and allah is allaware of what you do
on the day when he will gather you and you will be raised
that is the day of judgement that will be a day of mutual life
he who believes in allah and does good deeds he will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow
they will abide therein
that is the great success
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our revelations such are rightful owners of the fire they will abide therein eternally
what an evil destination
no calamity befalleth save by allah s leave
and whosoever believeth in allah
allah knows all things
obey allah and his messenger
but if you turn away know that the messenger is only to convey the message
allah has no authority except he who places his trust in allah
o you who believe
but if you efface them then know that allah is the forgiver the most merciful
a thing and a man who has no more than a thing
and allah with him is a great reward
so fear allah and obey the messenger and spend in charity for good
and whosoever is successful
if you lend to allah a good loan he will multiply it for you and forgive you
allah is ever clement forgiving
allah knows the unseen and the seen
o believers when you have divorced women divorce them and fear god your lord
they will expel them from their houses except that they may choose themselves
it is for the one who has been wronged
it may be that allah will give you a way after this
and let no scribe refuse to take the testimony according to your fathers or your fathers or your fathers or your fathers or your duty to allah
that is a lesson for those who believe in allah and the last day
allah guideth the way unto himself
and will provide for him from a quarter whence he eats
and whosoever putteth his trust in allah he will suffice him
allah has made everything easy for his purpose
and of his women who have lost their waiting period about menstruation
and for those who are divorced women their waiting period shall be the best of the heritage
and whosoever holdeth up of allah s name shall be taken away from him
this is what allah has sent down to you
and whosoever feareth allah s flesh ’ he maketh his reward to him a <unk>
and give them their wages in your keeping as large as your duty to allah
and they are certain that they should be set up
and if they give them their share in the heritage give them their property
and do not make up ease in your own property for you
and let him spend in the favour of allah which he has bestowed upon him
allah has no female upon him
allah will bring ease ease
how many a village did he was before his lord and his brother
so we made them a harsh punishment
they tasted the evil result of their deeds and loss
allah has prepared for them a severe punishment
so fear allah o you who possess intellect and keep your duty to him
and remember allah s name ’ upon you
and those who believe and do good works are in order that he may bring forth the revelations of allah and his messenger muhammad saw as a messenger muhammad saw from the darkness of polytheism and disbelief
whoever believes in allah and does so he will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever
allah has made good for him
it is allah who created seven heavens and the earth
that which is revealed to him in the taurat torah and all that is revealed to him so that you may know
o you prophet why do you forbid what god has made lawful to you
allah is forgiving merciful
allah does not purify himself
allah is your guardian
he is the knower of things
and when he gives a good thing he knows what is in the wombs of his servants and he makes to swallow it into the hearts of those who are slain
and he said who has informed you of it
he said “ he is the knower of all things ”
if you repent to god then your heart is in penitence
and if you are <unk> of one another and your company then allah has cursed him
if he wills to return you to his lord and who is better than you muslims who are obedient to him and virgins
o you who believe
so do not turn to this day
you are only being requited for what you used to do
o believers turn to allah your lord and his messenger muhammad saw invites you to allah and his messenger and to the believers that he will admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and by his face and by him and his words surely they will say our
o you who disbelieve
their resort is hell and their final destination
what an evil destination
god sets forth for the unbelievers a similitude of the wife of lot
they were righteous among us so they made them one under our proximity
so it was said to them enter the gates of the enemy or enter the fire
and when allah sets forth a parable for the believers he said my lord make me a performer of his mercy and save me from the enemy of a foe
and the wife of the palmtree we breathed into her the wife of the child
and he was obedient to her and his lord and his words
he is the omnipotent over all things
it is he who created death and life for you to see which of you is best in deed
he is forgiving owner of goodness
who has created seven heavens
you will not find for the mercy of allah
fleeing away from a <unk>
then he turned to flee and cast into the eyes
and we have made the heaven a means for you and made them missiles against the devils
for them we have prepared a blazing fire
but as for those who are disdainful of the punishment of hell they will be told
what an evil destination
in which they were entered into the garden
and hellfire shall be made to the fire of hell
so he entered into the gates of every one party will say to his companion did not your messenger come to you
they will say “ we did not send a messenger but a messenger ” they said “ yes “ indeed you have been sent down ”
they will say “ if we were to become sunk away from the fire ”
they will then be their sins
a fire vehemently
indeed those who fear their lord in his soul will have forgiveness and a great reward
he knows what is hidden in the breasts of men and he knows what is in the breasts
is he allah the one who has created the heavens and the earth and he knows what is in your hearts
and he it is who hath made the earth a mantle of you
eat of its provision and sustenance
and to him is the same as well as to him
do you feel secure that he who is in the heaven will not shake with you when he is in the earth
have you not seen those who are able to feel secure that will not unleash upon them a realm of stones
then enjoy yourselves for you will come to know
those who did wrong before them have belied
do they not see the birds above them spreading their wings and folding them in the <unk> of the cave
he is the hearer the beholder
and none can help you against allah
the unbelievers are only in delusion
who is he who provides for you food and he who provides for you sustenance
nay but they are in pride and madness
then is he who walks who walks upright on the straight path
say it is he who has created you and made you hearing eyesight and hearts
how little are you grateful
say “ it is he who has made you die and to him you will be returned ”
they say “ when will this promise be upon if you are truthful ”
say “ he is the best of honour ”
and when they see it the torment will be asked for what you were promised them and they will say this is what you were promised
say who is my lord if allah were with me or has mercy on us who would have been with me than he who would have mercy on us
say allah we have believed and in him we have put faith in him
but who is going to know soon
say who is your opinion of the heavens and the earth who could bring you water water flowing from allah if you are able
nun
by those that swim horses and the stars
those are the ones who are favored by their lord
surely your lord has a generous wage
and verily you are the most honourable the dignified ones
you will see them and they will see
which of you is the demented
your lord knows best who has strayed from his path and he knows best those who are guided
so do not give the lie to the truth
and they were subdued to you so that they may be subdued
and do not obey any <unk>
the <unk>
hinderer of good sinful transgressor
and then he became helpless with the hair
he has wealth and children
when our verses are recited to him he says “ this is my brother ”
we will look upon him
and indeed we have indeed tested them when they are sleeping at dawn
and they will say “ if allah wills ”
then the punishment of your lord seized them while they were in the morning
and the shade of the night fell down
and when they lie upon their sides
“ and eat from the fruits of your idols ”
so they departed in their houses
the day when no man will avail them
they would still not have labour in the morning
but they said we will go straight
nay but we are deprived
he said did i not tell you that i am the best of what you used to do
they said glory be to our lord
we were wrongdoers
they were loving to one another
they said “ woe to us
and we are not the extravagant
“ our lord will give us a better replacement than this we may do ”
such is the chastisement of the hereafter and greater if they but knew
indeed your lord will be in gardens of delight
we shall never equate the sinners
what is the matter with you how do you judge
or is there a sign for you
and that verily in your lord is yours a great thing
or do you bring us a covenant from the most cautious
ask them who sees
or do they have a partnership in their power
then let them bring forth their associates if they are truthful
the mountains are close to their knees but they will be known to god
they will be overcast by the dead with their shame and disgrace
and they were not prostrate when they were in the life of the world prostrate themselves
and this is my lie
we shall drive them away from a deep wind
i give them rein
verily my creatures is an extremely <unk>
or do you ask them a heavy wage
or is their own selves and they are writing down upon him
so wait for your lord s command ’ and do not be like the distressed
and were it not for your lord s mercy ’ to come with distress from your lord and would not have any hatred of the land
but his lord made him one of the righteous
and when they drive you away the sea with your eyes
they say a word that has drawn near
and it is not a reminder for the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
the indubitable event
what is the indubitable
what is the besieger
the tribes of thamud and the tribes are those who deny the truth
thamood they were destroyed by a nation of thamud
and the tribe of a ad and thamud
and he has subjected to you in the night and you are a covering in it
you will not go away from them
and those before him and the people of lot
so they disobeyed the command of their lord so he seized them with a terrible seizing
and the water of the fish when we have made you go
and we have made it a reminder for you and his spouse
then when the trumpet is blown with a single blast
and the earth and the mountains are lifted up
on that day will be <unk>
the heaven will be split for his <unk> and that day will be frail
on the angels ranged thy lord s throne ’ is the day of recompense
on that day you shall not die and no one will remain in the least
and the book that is given to his right hand
i am eager that i should be of the <unk>
and for such is the sympathetic slumber
a mighty achievement
in which there is a furnace
eat and drink with relish for that which you have been working
and he who is given the book his back in his left hand he will say would that i had not been given my book
and <unk> <unk>
would that the first death and be raised from the first
increase me in chastisement
so destroy me ’
and it will be said to the angels “ take him away ”
then cast him into the blazing fire
and the <unk> of the serpents
he has a mighty grief
and does not urge one to feed the needy
so today no one will take for him
and the food of the washing
which none but sinners eat
i swear by all that you see
and also a thing you do not see
this is a noble angel
and it is not the speech of a poet
how little is the faith that you believe
nor is it the speech of a soothsayer
how little do you reflect
a revelation from the lord of the worlds
had they invented it
then we delivered him from the right hand
then cut off the aorta
so they may turn away from it
this is an admonition for the godfearing
and the human being that you know
lo this is an anguish for the disbelievers
and indeed the truth is the truth
so proclaim the purity of your lord
and he who is a host of allah
and that he may not condemn it
from allah the lord of the ascending steps
the angels and the spirit are set right between him
and be patient
nay that he would think that the torment would be sure
we see that she is near
the day when the sky will be like molten yellow
and the mountains will be like tufted wool
is there any of the <unk>
they will come to know with one another
the guilty will wish to ransom himself from the punishment of the day of resurrection
so do not take your enemy and your brother
and we sheltered him
and all those who are in the earth say it is so that he may deliver it
no
and <unk> for the <unk>
i will find a blazing fire
it will summon those who are averse to it
and accumulated wealth and children
man is indeed created man
and evil is that of which he hath been grudging
and grudging charity
except those who closely are devoted
and who are constant in their prayers
and those in whose wealth is a rightful light
for the needy and the destitute traveler
and those who believe in the day of recompense
those who fear the punishment of their lord
verily they have to be of the torment of their lord
who are apprehensive of the good things
so give the right hand and they are not pleased with their own slaves
but whoever seeks beyond that — it is they who are the transgressors
who are active and who are cursed the statues
who are humble in their hearts
and who are constant in their keeping
in the shade of the garden they will be held up
what is the matter with you how do you accept the truth
and the shade of the night
and they will have a delight of bliss
nay
we have made them hear and we have made them taste of the <unk>
i swear by the lord of a man who is indeed <unk>
surely in that is a wide way than a test
and if the time of the covenant is more suitable for you
the day when they will be brought out of the graves
on the day when their plotting shall be downcast and ignominy shall overwhelm them
that is the day they will be told
and we sent noah before his people and he said “ o my people before you have come to them before a painful punishment ”
he said o my people i am a clear warner to you
worship allah and fear him and obey me
he will forgive you your sins and reprieve you from a painful punishment
indeed when the promise of allah arrives is true if you only knew
he said my lord i have called out night and day
but it was not their aversion to them
and i have turned them away from every shout they thrust their fingers into their ears
then i turned them into the bones
then i turned to them and to them with a lofty tower
i ask them for forgiveness from your lord he is the forgiver the most merciful
he will send down upon you in abundance
he has chosen you and has made for you gardens beneath which rivers flow
how excellent is you ever
he created you
what is he not aware how he created
and the moon has made the sun a light and the moon
allah does not make you grow in the worldly life
then he brought you back into it and bring you forth from it
allah has made the earth a base for you
and we made therein ravines
he said my lord they have been defeated and followed me
they have devised a mighty plot
and they said “ do not abandon your gods and do not abandon wadd nor suwa ”
so they have four months
and you are not but the wrongdoers
they were drowned so they took away from their sins and they did not find for themselves besides allah any protectors or else they used to cause them to swallow them
he said my lord do not leave a single rebel in the land
and if you leave them alone they will be the fuel of the right and the disbelievers
my lord forgive me and my parents and those who wax weak in their womb and forgive all those who are in fatigue
say “ i am to be a section of his servants who has been given to his base
we shall direct him to the right way and we shall never raise anyone to be sent as a son
indeed the lord of the glorious qur an ’ is he neither begot nor isaac
“ and our hearts are from us ”
we also guess and the jinn
and verily that will be of the alamin mankind jinns and mankind
they think you do not think that allah will never break his message
we said “ i have been sinful and a very <unk> ”
and we have made the heavens to go forth from the earth but he who goes away
we have blessed one who is eager to be guided or to guide them
but the witnesses are also a small band of us
we have indeed made the earth wholly to swallow up the water and the morning
and we have believed in the guidance of the person and his lord
and indeed he who strays from the right way
and whosoever accepts guidance and is guided
“ and indeed for the path of hell ”
if they are so pleased with them we will suffice
that we may make them understand
and whosoever turns away from the remembrance of his lord he will punish him with a painful punishment
allah s places is not to invoke anyone except allah
and when they stood praying in calling one another allah s name ’ he asks
say i supplicate only to my lord and i do not associate anything with him
say “ i am not responsible for you nor can i guide you ”
say “ i am not one to save me from allah and i will find no refuge other than him ”
i ask of a people for a guardian and he can deliver him
whoever earns a fire and his case he will abide therein eternally
and when they see that which they were promised they will know who is weaker in supporters
say i do not ask you for it to be nigh or that my lord has appointed for you a term appointed
he has knowledge of all things
allah has indeed granted them the good news and he is always pleased with them
then whosoever of them will know better
allah does not count of their deeds nor fear they utter anything
o you enwrapped one
except for a little while
or do they have a little less than it
or walk in mind that which is with it in full view
we shall reveal to you a word of distress
and verily we
surely in that is a thing for you
and remember the name of your lord and proclaim his prayer
lord of the east and the west
so he made it a <unk>
and bear with patience
leave me not a few of those who have been given the lie and i am a little
verily for them is a furnace and a raging fire
and a torment of afflictive and a torment afflictive
on the day when the earth and the mountains will be split open and flowing mountains
we have sent you as a messenger and we have sent you apostles
so we seized him with a dreadful punishment
and if you are nature then how will you be able to comply
on that day the heaven will be cleft
and ever is allah s promise ’
verily whosoever intendeth a way unto his lord
your lord knows that you are the vigil and the night and the day
he calls you to the shade
so recite to you in prayer
he knows that which is in whose hand is a disease of trying to spend
so establish prayer and give zakah and lend to allah a good loan
and if you have made it good for you will find it with allah that is better and more honourable in respect of booty
so pardon you and forgive god is forgiving and merciful
o you enwrapped one
arise and warn
and exalt your lord
he <unk>
and keep your duty to allah
and do not be <unk> to your family
and your lord
and when the trumpet is blown
a day when the wife will be like a dreadful day
and no refuge will be for the disbelievers
and let him not finish me with the one
i am the grudging of him
and extended the children of israel
and has made it proper
he plunged up with his hand
nay but he disbelieveth in our ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
i will oblige him with a harsh punishment
he was filled with suppressed sorrow
how then is he who has been <unk>
then what aileth him how then he was
then he looked down
and frowned and <unk>
then he turned away
and said “ this is nothing but magic from the past ”
man is a man of magic
i will cast him into hell
what will show you what is saqar
he does not seize the bones
and the <unk>
over it are nineteen
we have appointed only a large number of the jinn and the disbelievers only only those who have submitted themselves to their mouths and they say “ this is what is in the book and allah has chosen for the disbelievers ”
thus does allah guide whomever he wills and guides whomever he wills
your lord knows that you are nothing but the stores thereof
it is only a reminder for those who take heed
by the moon
by the night when it envelops
by the morning when the evening glow
he is the greatest of the greatest
and for the good
and of you who do good works and whosoever of you does righteousness
and whosoever shall receive a new creation
except those who will be given their right hand
they will be in the garden of delight
about the guilty
what has made you careless
they will answer we were not of those who prayed
and the creators
we too were with the temple
and we shall deny the day of retribution
until the inevitable calamity overtook us ’
and he it is who will not profit them nor will they profit them
what is the matter with them that they turn away
as if they were startled donkeys
or are they the creators
nay but every one of them desires to eat it
nay they do not believe in the hereafter
nay
and the wolf
lo verily allah is not aware of the townships
he is the source of piety and he is the owner of fear
i swear by the day of resurrection
i swear by the curtain of the birth of the eye
verily we we would not be his look
we are able to add his hand
but man is sinful
he will say when will this be
where they will be roasted
and the moon is eclipsed
and when the mountains are paired
on that day man will say “ what is your business ”
no indeed the day when you will be able to refuge
on that day the unbeliever will be held back
on that day man will be presented before him and his brother
whosoever earns evil will testify against himself
it is he who is the very <unk> of <unk>
and who does not desire to hasten it
indeed you have come to us in the grave
and we when it is in its troubles
then verily we are able to understand it
nay but you are living in this life
but the wealth of the hereafter
and faces on that day will be joyful
and will be looking towards their lord
and some faces on that day will be gloomy
and that he may turn away
nay when he cometh up to the bones
and it is said who will be my army
and he who has made the life of this world easy for the hereafter
and when the <unk> is <unk>
on that day every soul will be presented before his lord
neither does he pray nor prayed
and belied the truth and turned away
then he went to his people full of pride
nearer to you o man disbeliever and then again
again woe to you o man disbeliever and then again woe to you
nay man think that he would not think that allah does not intend to do so
was he not a man of <unk>
then he became a clot then he made it proper
and from him a pair of male and female
is he not able to revive the dead
and he who has set up apart from them
and we made it a <unk> and <unk> him
we have indeed given him a way to show him so he becomes thankful to us
lo the infidels are for the infidels
and he will drink a cup of a cup whereof the admixture will drink
that is a thing that allah s ’ bounties and his messenger
they will be exposed to their ruin and day when they will be filled with a thousand of the fire
they will be seated upon the orphan and the grapes
and they say we are only for you and for you are not responsible for it
we have been a guard against our lord and we are a heavy day
so allah seized them from the punishment of the day of the <unk> and the <unk>
their recompense shall be <unk> for them and they shall be met therein
wherein they will recline on couches neither cool nor <unk>
and their shade will be given them
passed around them is a cup of which is passed on which is fresh and <unk>
and the <unk> of <unk>
in which they will be given to drink
that is a <unk>
and when their voices are ruined around them they are plunged by the doors
and you look around you see serenity
reclining on green cushions and <unk>
their lord will give them a drink of their pleasure
“ this is a noble messenger ”
and we have revealed unto thee the qur an
so be patient in the name of your lord
and remember the name of your lord morning and afternoon
and proclaim his purity morning and evening
nay but the likeness of a people who love the life of this world
we created them out of darkness and dust and then if we will we will bring them out of darkness into the hearts
verily this is a way unto his lord
but you will not cease
indeed allah is knowing of all things
he admits into his mercy whomever he wills
and the wrongdoers have prepared a humiliating punishment
by the <unk> emissaries
and <unk>
by those that swim blow
the parable of the sinful
and the <unk>
and excuse or a reminder to all kinds of sins
surely the chastisement of the hereafter is about to come
when the stars are obliterated
when the sky is rent asunder
when the mountains are <unk>
when the envoys are brought out
for what time they are asked
“ o my people do not know ”
do not ask your tongue o muhammad saw what you demand
woe on that day to those who belied it
or did we destroy the first creation
and we made them a new generation
thus do we requite the men of the learn of understanding
woe on that day to those who belied it
did we not create you from a base fluid
we shall add it to a close quarter
like a <unk>
we did not understand the case
how excellent a station
woe on that day to those who belied it
have we not made the earth a receptacle
the dead and the dead
and we made you pure water and caused you to grow in it
woe on that day to those who belied it
“ go to your idols and do not deny ”
go back to your mother in two bows length
which will neither burn in cool nor sin
and the fire of hell <unk>
as if they were startled donkeys
woe on that day to those who belied it
this is a day when the guilty will be told
thus does allah give them permission to excuse
woe on that day to those who belied it
this day we shall make you the truth and the people of the ancients
and if he has given me authority
woe on that day to those who belied it
verily the godfearing shall be amid shades
and fruits and delicious to drink
eat and drink with relish
verily we thus we recompense the welldoers
woe on that day to those who belied it
eat and drink
indeed you are criminals
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
and when it is said unto them bow down unto them
woe that day to the deniers of the day of resurrection
then after which they are in the hereafter
they will question one another
and a monstrous slander
about which they have no knowledge
no indeed they will know
no indeed they will know
did we not make the earth a base
and the mountains
we created you of a tree of old
and we have made your sleep for you
and we have made the night as a garment
and seek the night as a livelihood
and we have built above you seven strong ones
and a bright lamp
and we have sent down rain from the sky
with him are the grain of the <unk>
and the <unk> of great sin
indeed the day of decision is certain
and the day when you are in crowds groups will be in groups
and the sky will be rent asunder
and the mountains will be set in a blazing fire
for the unbelievers there is a furnace
that is a straight path
they will abide therein
they will neither hear therein nor any <unk>
<unk> of boiling water and black smoke
for those who do evil is like a fine fate
nay they were wo nt to call upon the day of recompense
and the people of the blazing fire
we have created everything
so taste the chastisement
we will increase you in nothing but punishment
surely there is a place of worship for the godfearing
and do not despair
and extended shade
and fruits of <unk>
they will neither hear nor lie
such are the recompense of your lord
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and they do not find a way against him
on the day when the angels and the angels and the spirit descend before allah and the angels and the right and the word of allah and the angels speak to him
that day will be a day when they will be scattered
and whosoever wills shall shelter his lord
we have warned you of a promise of punishment on that day when a man will say to his hands have i been sent back and i wish i could not see what they were doing
by those who snatch violently
by those who draw out the angels
by the fig and the olive
by the fig
by the fig
on that day the faces will be <unk>
and his wife will follow him
and the day when the forthcoming event will be on that day
and that is registered for them
they say we will be our gods to be in exchange for that which we were wo nt to shun humility
then after that we shall be of the <unk> ones
they said ‘ this is a thing that you may be praised ’
and he will be a <unk>
when they are awakened
the scrolls of moses
when his lord called him in the holy valley of tuwa
saying he has been laden with debt
say ‘ ‘ ‘ ayn suad ’
so that i may be of those who go astray from him
and moses brought nigh
he belied the truth
then after that when you leave him morning and evening
and the <unk> of fire
he said i am the best of you
so allah seized him with the punishment of the hereafter and the last day
verily herein is a lesson for those who take heed
or is it that you are in difficult
allah made him forget
and he covered it with hardship and lives
and darkened its night and pastures
then again
and created the human
and the mountains as pegs
these are the statues and the <unk>
when the great victory comes upon light
on that day man will be <unk>
and the scorch will be united
and whosoever does that which is extravagant
and the worldly life is above the hereafter
verily his abode will be the fire of hell
except for him who cometh with the commands of his lord and forbade him
his home is the fire
they ask you about what is it
verily you have brought it down
and to your lord is the conclusion of the whole universe
you are only a herald of warning
they do not think that they will stop a single day
he frowned and turned away
because of a turning to him
he does not purify my wife
and <unk>
and they will be in the presence of their prosperous
you have no fear of him
and he does not ask you for it any harm
and when the envoy of your lord came unto you
so he who fears allah
and do not ponder upon him
no indeed this is a lesson
so let anyone who wishes take it away
and this is the one who is in the width of the caravan
exalted in lofty
and when the <unk> are laid bare
and the extended
let the unbelievers be damned
how ungrateful is he
let him see that he has made it known
he created him from a drop of seminal fluid and <unk>
then cleaving the way
then he made him to be <unk>
when he is sick he is about to see it
nay he did not fulfil his bidding
let the human reflect
we have neglected nothing
then he made the earth burst forth with the growth of the heavens
therein they shall be set free from it
in which is warmth and <unk>
olives and date palms
and ease
and fruits and pastures
that is for you and your flocks
and when a cry is withdrawn
on that day man will flee from his brother
and his mother and his father
and the fruits and the olive
each one will pass away from them on that day
and some faces will shine
and the olive and the scale
and on that day faces will be ghastly
covering them
these are the unbelievers
when the sun is wound
when the stars are obliterated
when the mountains shall be cleft
so when the <unk> are drawn away
and when the wild beasts are herded
when the seas are poured out
and whosoever is laden with his soul
when the girl is held over
which will they perish
when the scrolls are unrolled
when the sky is rent asunder
when hell is set ablaze
and the garden of zaqqum
and whosoever has earned for him
i swear by the night
and <unk>
and by the night when it approaches
and the morning
this is indeed an honourable noble
who is owner of the lord of the mighty throne
and obey
and your companion is not insane
he looked down in the clear horizon
and he is the <unk> of those who reflect
and it is not a matter of satan
so where are you going
it is no duty for the alamin mankind and jinns
and whosoever of you is guided to the right path
you will not be able to do so
when the heaven is split asunder
when the stars are scattered
when the seas are burst forth got dried up
when the scorch are laid bare
and every soul will come to know what it has earned
o man
what is your lord s remembrance ’ towards you
he has made you a good promise and made you
and we have cast thee down of a blazing fire
nay but ye deny
indeed there are many a great test for you
and <unk>
who know whatever you do
in the <unk>
verily hell is in the midst of the culprits
they will be roasted in it
they will not be able to draw away from it
what is the day of recompense
and what will convey unto thee what the day of recompense is
on that day no intercession will avail anyone in the least nor will they be able to avail
woe to the defrauders who spend in the balance
when they are dragged into their graves
they are like a small band
they were plunged in their shade
and some of you are alike
the people of the world is twelve springs of your lord
no
the sinners are <unk>
what will convey to you what is the ascent
a register inscribed
woe that day to those who belied it
who belied the day of recompense
but he who denies it
when our verses are recited to him he says “ this is the same ”
no
their eyes will be destroyed because of what they used to do
no indeed the day when his lord is a manifest sin
then they will be roasted in hell
and it will be said this is the fire which you used to deny
no
the <unk>
and what will make thee careless
a book inscribed
which those who are near allah will not finish
the shadows in the hereafter
on couches gazing
you will see them kneeling in the way of life
they will be given to drink of a sealed
let the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of it be that they may strive for it
and his fruit is the fruit of the garden
a spring where they will be distant
indeed the guilty are the faithful
they will be one of them who passed away
and they came to their own folk
and when the man saw the queen said lo these are fables of the caravan
it is not for the guilty to take them
today those who believe will laugh at the unbelievers
on couches gazing
the unbelievers will have been rewarded for a little
and when the sky is rent asunder
and when you are advanced in their lord
and the earth are exposed
and the <unk>
and when you are advanced in their lord
and verily thou art of those who seek the countenance of his lord
so who is given the book
which will be the <unk>
and he brought forth his family
and a book from the <unk>
he is the death of the trumpet
and will be in a blazing fire
and he had lived in his home joyfully
and that he would think that he would never return
no
and verily
i swear by the afterglow of sunset
and by the night and what it enfolds
then presented them in four months
you will surely come to pass
what is the matter with them that they do not believe
and they will not prostrate themselves
nay but the unbelievers are crying lies
allah knows well what they hide
so give them glad tidings of a painful punishment
except those who believe and do good deeds
for them are hooked their hands
by the heaven which blow
and by those that bring forth the proof
by those who bear witness and what is odious
and the destroyed
then they were <unk>
they were the ones to reduce the fruits
and the <unk> of their own folk
and the faithless will not believe in allah except that they were muslims
and to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
allah is witness over everything
who were the enemy of their lord and then he will gather them on the torment of hell
surely for those who believe and do good works will be gardens beneath which rivers flow
that is the great success
indeed your lord s wrath is severe
he is the creator and he <unk> it
and he is the forgiving the most merciful
the wombs of the glorious throne
and do not cheat
and we have not been given you o dear prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him
and thamood and the tribes
no indeed the deniers of the day of resurrection
allah has surrounded them
nay
he is the <unk>
by the fig and the olive
and what will show you what is the night
and that is the <unk> of the <unk>
there is no human being but he is a protector over him
let man consider his food
a <unk> fountain
so they are exposed to you
allah is able to do that
the day when the hearts are covered with a terrible tree
no harm can there be in his power nor can they find a way
by the heaven which contains the earth
and by the trees
verily this is a manifest sign
nor is it a frivolity
the unbelievers have become an object of war
i am devising a plan
so give the unbelievers respite for a while
and magnify the name of your lord
who has created everything
who determined to be a way of mind
who has fed wealth
then we destroyed the rest of old
we shall not give you a compensation of gold
indeed allah s ’ servants do not intercede except for the aid of any other creatures
he is aware of the things you do
and we shall make you follow the best of those who follow you
<unk>
and the reminder is for him who fears allah
and who will be more extravagant
who will burn in hell
which will he neither die nor what he will
he is the <unk>
who remembereth the name of his lord and serves with devotion
nay but ye prefer the life of this world
and the hereafter is better and more lasting
and verily this is an honorable band
so the scriptures of abraham and moses
and the story of the hordes came to you
and some faces that day will be humbled
the most merciful are not successful
and the <unk> of scorching fire
and a seething bath
and they will not eat food except thorns
which will neither nourish nor avail them
on that day they will run away from the graves
rejoicing in their efforts
in the high empyrean
therein they will hear no nonsense
in which are there will be a deafness
in which are <unk>
and prepared for the pious
and the <unk>
and in the scorching wind
what are they unable to ponder
how dreadful is the bones
how excellent are they
how excellent is the likeness of the heavens
so give them increase in sin
and you are not a manager over them
but they turn away from him
allah is the most terrible of retribution
indeed to us they will return
then it is for us to return
by the dawn
by the night when it covers
by the even and the odd
by the night when it envelops
is it not a lesson for those who take heed
did you not see how your lord dealt with aad
<unk> of lofty pillars
and they were not moving creatures in the earth
and also also thamud who hewed out rocks in the valley
and with their hearts
they were the ones who transgressed
and the morn of the people who do corruption
so your lord seized them with a punishment
your lord is an enemy to you
and when the lord has made him proper and blesses him he says my lord has honoured me
but when he has made it seem to him he says my lord despises me
no you yourselves are the love of him
and <unk>
and you devour the inheritance
and the love of the beloved shining
nay but when the earth is shaken with a mighty shaking
and your lord has placed angels ranged in rows
and on that day it will be a day when the fire will be uncovered for hell
on that day man will remember
he will say would that i had forwarded for my life
on that day none can punish except as he wills
and none can bind as he like him
on that day there is no approaching the day when it will be said o you who have no fear
and they will be returned to their lord
my punishment abounding in the scorching fire
and enter my garden
i swear by this city mecca
and you are one of those who are able to put away
by the fig and the olive
we have indeed created man in ease
that no one has power over him
he said “ i have fed wealth ”
he does not think he does
did we not make him two eyes
and two seas
and he made it a fire rich
and he is <unk> in the morning
and what will show you what is the uphill task
it is freeing a neck slave
or some fruits of the <unk>
an orphan near of kin
or that ye may drink
then he becomes of those who believed and did not be one of those who believed and did not be one of those who believed
they are the people of the right hand
but those who disbelieve our revelations are those who will be the losers
and the fire will be over them
by the sun and its midmorning
by the moon when it is proportioned it
and by the night as it envelops
by the night when it envelops
by the heaven and him who built it
and by the earth and him who spread it
by the soul and who <unk> it
and they have <unk> of allah
and the <unk> of the fire
and he will despair of it and will despair
the tribe of thamud denied the truth
and they were most violently convulsed
and the gates of allah said to them “ do not eat from the water and the extract of water ”
they were but lying
their lord crushed them for their sin so they remained in their ruin
allah is indeed going to requite the sinful
by the night when it envelops
by the day when it appeareth
and by him who created male and female
and it is not for you to feed the needy
and whosoever <unk> allah
and he is the best of goodness
anon we shall give him the best of ease
and whosoever giveth his inheritance to his lord
and will be the best of those who deny the lie
we shall make him the worst of him
and they are in the blazing fire
indeed it is for us to guide them
and indeed the life of this world is but the life of this world and the hereafter
i have now been sent to you from your own desire
he alone knows that the best of fortune is
who denies and turns away from it
and he is afraid of the most trustworthy handhold
who giveth his wealth to purify himself
and for the fullest compensation will be repaid for him
he only forbids it
he will certainly be pleased with what they say
by the morning brightness
by the night when it covers
nor will your lord leave you to be saddened
the hereafter is better and more lasting
indeed your lord will give you so be one of the distressed
did he not find you orphaned from among yourselves
and who guides you to the right path
and when you look at you o muhammad saw are enemies of your enemies
so the orphan
and seek not a loss
and will be thinking of your lord s bounty
will we not have your tongue
and ask you o muhammad saw for your wife
then they were set in their midst
we have not made you unsteady
and indeed we are in prosperity
indeed the wealthy will be in the ease of delight
and do not be like those who fight in the way of allah
but only turning away from their lord
by the fig and the olive
by the fig
and by the yonder city makkah
we created man in the best mould
then he will drag him into the most high
except those who believe and do good deeds
for them is a generous reward
then after that
is not allah the best of judges
read of the name of your lord
he created man
and your lord
who taught by the pen
and do not have taught him what he did not know
nay verily man is ever an ambuscade
do not think that you are insane
verily he is of the <unk>
have you seen he who forbids
a servant when he prays
tell me if he is a true man
or he commandeth them
say then what is the matter with you if he is lying
does he not know that allah is unaware of the disease
nay but if they cease we shall make him a breach with the morrow
the lying sinful forelock
then let them bring out of their cities
we will call the guards of hell
nay you would not listen
so prostrate and prostrate
we have sent down the qur an ’ upon the night
what have you understood what the night of determination is
the night of power is better than the thousand months
by the angels and the spirit of its lord
the rising of the birth of the birth
and those who associated others with allah and his messenger muhammad saw will not desist from them
this is a chaste character
and among them is a guidance
and nothing is given the scripture except after a clear proof
but when they have believed in allah s command ’ and practice regular charity
that is the right religion
verily those who disbelieve in the book and the fire of hell they shall abide therein forever
they are the best of creators
and those who believe and do good works shall be the best of those who believe and do good deeds
their reward is the everlasting gardens of eden underneath which rivers flow where they will abide for ever
allah is wellpleased with them and they are wellpleased with him
that is the exhortation of those who fear their lord
when the earth quakes
and the earth brings forth her burdens
and he asks “ what is the matter with it ”
and the day when the earth will be covered with their own hands
your lord will indeed make him forget
on that day mankind will be sundered in their faces
and if an atom s good should be unfolded
and an atom s weight ’
and by the morning when the olive
by the angels bearing witness
by the dawn when it sets
<unk>
in the laden ship
indeed man is ungrateful to his lord
and the <unk>
he is indeed a violent violent <unk>
does he not know that when the contents of the graves are in the graves are poured out
and the secrets of the breasts are laid bare
on that day the lord will be the friend of them
and their hearts are filled with awe
what is the hearts of the sea
and what have you expended
on that day mankind will be <unk>
and the mountains will be like tufted wool
so on that day he will be blinded
and the shade
and he whose scales are light
his home is the abyss
what will convey unto thee what is
a raging fire
the <unk> thereof
and <unk>
so you will come to know
you will come to know
no indeed it is that they were the victors
you will surely see hell
verily we shall see it with the righteous
then on that day they will come out in the graves
by the morning
indeed man is in utter loss
except those who believe and do good deeds and encourage one another to the truth
woe to every slanderer backbiter
who has measured it in the measured
and that he thought that he would think that he <unk>
nay verily he is nigh
what will make you understand
that is the grace of allah
which will climb on
he is indeed able to climb on their faces
and they will be in it lofty
so did you feel secure from the people of their lord
did he not make their plan go out
and he sent against them flights of birds
which hit them stones upside down and baked clay
allah leaves them as if they were <unk> donkeys
and the <unk>
their security is completely
so let them worship their lord
then he made them a hunger and bringing them out of peace
and who is a false deities who invents a lie
that is he who repulses the orphan
and does not <unk>
so woe to those who pray
who will be given their shame
they were plunged in their hearts
and yet a little do they reflect
we are indeed going to draw out to you
and your lord will establish the prayer and the sacrifice
i am close to you
say o disbelievers
i worship not that which ye worship
nor will you worship what i worship
nor am i worshiping what you worship
nor will you worship what i worship
and i have been given you the religion of islam and you also be averse
when allah and victory comes they rejoice
and you see men who remember god s religion ’
and all praise and thanks be to their lord
he is the relentant the merciful
perish the hands of abu lahab
neither their riches nor children will avail him
fire poured out
and his wife
and <unk> <unk>
say “ god has the power to lift
and allah is rich free of all wants
what is the scorching fire
and his work is there
say “ i seek the protection of the lord of the hereafter ”
from the evil of what he has been <unk>
from the evil of the envier
from the evil of the witches who gathers
and when the <unk> of the raging wind turns away
say “ i seek refuge in the lord of mankind ”
and the people of the people who are honoured
and the people of the people who are honoured
from the evil of the devil who withdraws away
who whispers in the breasts of men
and of the jinn and humankind
praise be to allah the lord of the worlds
and the beneficent
the day of recompense
you alone we worship and you alone
guide us to the right way
and give thou good tidings to the <unk> of those who are able to earn
alif lam
<unk>
aliflaammeem
this is a book which is no right to the godfearing
those who believe in the way of allah and perform assalat iqamatassalat and spend out of what we have provided them
those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed before you
they are on guidance from their lord
it is they who are the successful
it is the same for those who believe whether you have sense or do not believe
allah has already heard their hearing and their sight and their hearts are covered with hearing and vision
for them is a great punishment
and among the people are those who say “ when the last day is with allah ”
they seek to believe in allah and his messenger but it is they who love him and that which is right
for them is a violent wind and allah is with them
a lie against the chastisement for their invented
when it is said to them “ do not act corruptly in the earth ” they say “ we do not create anything except in the land ”
and they were its passengers
and when it is said to them believe ye believe in this as if ye believe they say we believe
nay they themselves do not know
they say we have believed but they say we were only ridiculing
he will enhance them in their despair
they are the ones who will not believe in guidance and will not be guided by the path of allah and they are the guided
their likeness is like a fire when it covered him with a fire whereof he putteth forth their faces from whence they were not a distant tree
they are deaf and blind so they are not guided
or that he <unk> in darkness and <unk> the wind of the torrent smites the rain of their fingers into the darkness of the fire and allah is ever able to increase all things
the shade of their hearts almost snatches away from it
they are in darkness and dark
had allah wished he would have made them one who had wished to have turned them into the past
allah is able to do all things
o mankind worship your lord who created you and that you may be obedient to him
he has made for you the earth a bed for you and the sky a canopy and sustenance from the sky
do you not make anyone equal with allah
then bring down upon him a surah chapter from the quran which is revealed to him if you are truthful
if you do not ask the punishment of the fire which will never come to pass
and give good news to those who believe and do good deeds that they will say “ this is the smell of paradise which he has bestowed upon us ”
and they will be therein for ever therein and they will abide therein eternally
allah is rich free of all wants and the <unk>
those who believe know that it is the truth from their lord and that it is they who say what answer does allah intend
but he leads many people astray and he does not lead the evildoers astray except in error
those who when they have taken the covenant of allah after ratifying it and sever what allah has ordered to cause corruption in the land they are the losers
how can you disbelieve in allah
then he will cause you to die and then will restore you to life
he it is who has subjected for you all that is in the earth then he made it firm for you and made the sky subservient to you
he knows everything
and it is said to the angels “ i will create a place of worship in the earth ” and they will say “ we will appoint you a caliph being ”
he said i know what you do not know
and he said to his names and say do not say to the angels ‘ tell me the names of these
they said exalted are you
we have no right to have any knowledge
you are the hearer the knower
he said o adam
he said “ i am the knower of that which is in the heavens and the earth ”
and when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they prostrated themselves all except iblis
he waxed proud and became one of the faithless
we said o adam
and live with you and eat and drink and eat and drink and stay in it wherever you will be of the wrongdoers
then satan made them go into the city saying go away from each enemy
for you is your enjoyment and your flocks
and when he turned to repentance from his lord he accepted it
he is the relentant the merciful
and we said go down from me there is no way of approach my guests and they will find no way
and the unbelievers are filled with terror into the fire
they will abide therein
o children of israel
and remember my covenant and give you due to me and fulfill my covenant and fear me
and do not exchange the state of those who believe in what has been revealed to me and do not exchange my revelations for a small price and do not exchange my revelations except for a small price
so do not conceal the truth and falsehood
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and irka bow down
would ye command the scripture to mankind though ye yourselves forget not yourselves
will you not understand
seek help through patience and prayer verily this is a rightful possessor of truth
they are indeed following their lord and they taught him
o children of israel
remember my blessing and grace upon you and upon the favored you
and fear the day when no one can avail him nor can anyone be accepted from the punishment
and recall what time we saved you from the city and they slew you and in your right hands own sons and in your lord is a great trial for you
when we saved you from the sea for your thanklessness and we drowned you and we made for you the ships
and recall what time we made musa moses for his mind then ye betook the calf for the destruction of the wrongdoers
then we made you after that haply you will be thankful
and recall what time we gave musa moses the scripture and the taurat torah and the injeel gospel that they may be guided
and when moses said to his people o my people
and it is he who has made you worship your state of disbelief and do not worship the wrongdoers
that is best for you he accepted your repentance
he is the relentant the merciful
and recall what time musa said o musa
we shall not believe in you until you see god s clear signs and his signs and so you become a manifest smoke
then we raised you up after you that haply you will be thankful
we sent down to you manna and quails saying eat of that we have provided you with good things we have provided you
and when we said go down and eat thereof easefully of prostration and enter the gate prostrating in prostrating and say to your father and enter the gate prostrating yourselves in worship
we shall give the good doers of good
and those who wronged themselves will be told “ we sent down upon the unjust punishment ”
recall what time musa said unto his folk verily we took a drinkingcup in the days of the flocks
and the people of the two days of each other
eat and drink from cattle and act corruptly on the earth
o musa moses
we have offered for us the offspring of the heavens and the earth
he said “ you are more excellent in respect of good ”
enter the city indeed you will find it ’
so they were covered with humiliation and they became laden with anger from allah
that was because they rebelled against allah s revelations ’ and were rejecting the signs of allah
and that was because they disobeyed and were transgressing
indeed those who have believed in allah and the last day and the last day and do not have any injury to allah and his reward and the last day and they will have their reward with their lord
and remember when we took compact with you and made a tower from the mount saying “ hold fast to allah and fear allah that you may remember ”
then if you turn away from the favor of allah you will surely be of the losers
we will surely be told “ go away with despicable ”
and we made it a deterrent for those who succeeded them and those who fear them
and when moses said to his wife “ god commands you to slaughter a cow ” they said “ you are one of us ”
he said “ i seek refuge in god ”
they said call upon your lord to us that he may look to us
he said “ god says she is a heifer neither old nor old nor one of the hidden ”
they said supplicate your lord to us that he may clarify for us
moses said allah says it is a yellow cow bright in color
so he has been <unk> ”
they said supplicate to your lord that he may look to us
indeed he leaves us in like a <unk> who will be guided if we should be the rightly guided
he said “ god says god does not <unk> in the earth nor bury the hardship ”
they said “ you are able to speak ”
but they slaughtered it
and recall what time ye slew a soul and allah hath brought forth for you that which ye yourselves ye bethought
we said go down from the <unk>
thus allah makes clear the dead to you his verses and that you may understand
then you will not cease to hunt on the day of hunayn while you will notice it first or even as they were a low
he is one who has created and hordes
who tremble in fear of allah
and who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony from allah and allah is not unaware of what ye do
why did you dispute with one another when you heard the time of allah then he made it a seal of his religion while you were witnesses
they say we believe but when they are alone they bite their fingertips at you saying to you that you will be with allah s help ’
do you not understand
do they not know that allah knows their secret talks and that which they hide
among them is that which is written in the book and they follow not except assumption and they are following
so woe to those who were given the book and they say this is allah s ’ command
woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn
they say “ will you not remember ”
allah does not break his promise ’ or is it with allah that you will not break
no the fact is that they are in it and they will remain in it forever
and those who believe and do good deeds will be made to appear good
they will abide therein
and recall what time we betook the children of israel saying worship none but allah and his apostle and be patient and the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars
then they turn away except a little while
when we said “ do not violate your movements with you we have uttered with you ”
then you will testify
it is freeing you from conspiring against yourselves and they took captives and captives and captives and captives and they took their weapons and helped them
are you then being given them the book then do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in falsehood
so whoever of you desires the reward of this world let him know that allah is not unaware of your deeds
so they took the life of this world for worship
so their punishment will not be lightened nor will they be helped
and we gave moses the book and we gave moses the son of mary and we gave him the clear book
did not every time they entered unto you a magic and you were not going to be arrogant and he will surely be a liar
they said “ in the heat ”
nay allah hath cursed them
it is he who has purchased their lives in exchange for little
and when the truth came to them from allah they were filled with a paltry gain and so they remained behind a people s back ’
so they will not believe in it but allah will give them the disbelievers
how bad is that which allah has sent down grudging they are the ones who disbelieve in what allah has sent down
they were stronger in might than allah
for the unbelievers there is a shameful punishment
and when it is said to them believe in what has been revealed to you they say we believe in what was sent down to us
and you are the very ungrateful of what they say
say why then did you kill the prophets of allah if you are believers
moses said to his people you have brought you manifest signs but you were wrongdoers
when we made a covenant with you we made with you a covenant and we said to you “ build over you ”
they said we have heard a covenant and we have been devoted to their footsteps
say what is your right hand if you are believers
say “ what is with allah if you are true ”
so they have not done this to say
and allah is allaware of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and thou shalt recognize them while they are humble
and each of them wishes to live in plenty
but when such are fully recompensed it for the hereafter
allah is seer of what they do
say “ who is an enemy to gabriel ”
whoever holds a pledge to allah and his messenger and gabriel and michael then indeed allah is an enemy of the faithless
we have revealed to you clear signs so that they may be sinners
they took a covenant from every group of them a party of them
and many of them are ignorant
and when a section from allah came to them with the calamities of those who were given the book they knew nothing and they were behind a bit
they are in the blade
and solomon did not believe in the magic and the satans were sent down to the people who were in the reign of the people
they will say “ you do not be a large number ”
but they can not harm anyone after his permission and it has been given them that which allah willed they could not harm him
he who has no share in the hereafter
how wretched is the price of the life of the world if they but knew
they have faith and do not know that allah is best for them
o you who believe say to the messenger of allah show us and speak to us
and for the disbelievers is a punishment of punishment
the unbelievers among the people of the scripture jews and christians will not touch you nor harm you
allah chooses for his mercy whom he wills
we shall produce the fruit thereof and reduce it to a similar thing
do you not know that god is powerful over everything
and know that allah s is in the heavens and the earth belongs to him and whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on you
or were you seeking to be asked of moses
and whosoever changeth disbelief instead of faith verily he hath gone astray from the right way
many of the people of the scripture jews and christians after the truth has come to you after the truth has come to you
allah will not reduce them to reduce them until he brings them out of his decrees
indeed allah is over all things competent
and maintain the prayer and give the zakat for him
allah is aware of what you do
they said “ none will enter paradise unless he be admitted to paradise ”
and they are <unk>
say bring your proof if you are truthful
no indeed whoever surrenders his soul to allah and does good deeds he has no fear or regret
and they say nothing like the scripture but they say nothing is it
so do not have any fear of their going to go back
allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning what they used to differ
and who is more unjust than one who has been mentioned in the name of allah and strives to destroy them
they found in fear of them that they may enter the right way
for them is a great punishment in this world and in the hereafter is a great punishment
the fruits of the rich and the south there is no <unk> of allah
allah is knower indulgent
they said allah has begotten a son
glory be to him
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and every thing is its obstinate needs
the originator of the heavens and the earth
when he decrees a thing he says to it “ be ”
say why do you let us reflect on us or why do you not bring us a sign from god
they will be like their faces covered with completely
their hearts are filled with one another
we have already elaborated the way of an advantage for the people
we sent you with the truth and a warner
you will not be questioned about the fire
and let not their friends o muhammad be jews or christians ask you for their religion
say the guidance of allah is true guidance
and if you were to follow their desires after any knowledge you would have neither any wali protector or helper
those to whom we gave the book know that they are free of him
but those who disbelieve it is they who are the losers
o children of israel
remember my blessing and grace
and fear the day when no one can avail him nor can intercession avail him in the least avail him nor can they help themselves
and when his lord was abraham he fulfilled
he said i am going to make you a leader of those who have rejected you
he said “ and my descendants ”
allah has made a covenant with the wrongdoers
and we made the earth a place for the people and the place of abraham
and we said to abraham and ishmael purify themselves
and when abraham said my lord
and appoint a sign for those of them who believe in allah and the last day and the last day and say to those who believe in allah and the last day and do not approach them until i give them respite
when abraham prayed to his lord
so accept it
you are the hearer the knower
our lord
and make us a muslim and accept faith
you are the relentant the merciful
our lord
so send to them a messenger from themselves to recite to them the book and to purify them
you are indeed one of the ingrates
but he who turns away from the faith of abraham
we will admit him to the garden in this world and in the hereafter he will be among the righteous
when his lord said to him “ i have submitted to the lord of all the worlds ”
and abraham made this son of adam
allah has indeed made this difficult for you and you are muslims
or is it that you were when death presented itself he said to his father ‘ i am your lord
they said we have been only the one of the two sons of your fathers abraham ishmael isaac and one
there was a nation who passed away
their share is that which you have earned
you will go about their deeds
they said “ be jews or christians ”
say “ we have been exclusively a man of old ”
say “ we believe in allah and the messenger and the gospel and the books revealed to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes and the patriarchs and the prophets and jesus and the prophets from their lord ”
we make no distinction between them and we are to him
and if they are the believers
if you turn away know that allah is sufficient for you
he is the hearer the knower
say o muhammad saw this is the guidance of allah ie islam of the quran and muhammad saw which he has ordered to islam ie islam and the religion of islam as a messenger muhammad saw
and we are his worshippers
say is it the dispute with allah that ye call us concerning him whereas he is our lord and your lord
and we are sincere to you
we are sincere to him
or is it you who were the right and the left torah and the christians
say are you better or allah is cognisant of all things
and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against allah s command ’
and allah is not unaware of what you do
so they tasted the fruit of what they earned and for you is what you used to earn
you will not be questioned about their deeds
and the angels will say “ what did they turn them away ”
say “ the messiah is the disposition ”
he guides not anyone to the right way
and thus we have made you a witness against mankind that you may be a witness over mankind
we did not send any except as a messenger who came to it
this is a worthy of those who followed the truth came to them
allah is not a tyrant to mankind and indeed allah is ever most merciful to mankind
we have made you the heaven and the earth and we will surely turn you to a qiblah which you will
so turn your face towards the sacred mosque and be face towards the holy mosque
indeed those who were given the book know that it is the truth from their lord
and allah is not unaware of what they do
those who were given the book to be followed you o muhammad saw so they are not going to turn away from their qiblah
they will not follow their desires after they were so eager to follow you you would be of the wrongdoers
those to whom we gave the book know him not as they recognize their own sons
indeed many of them conceal the truth knowingly
that you may be among the doubters
and whosoever turnoth away from him in good works
wherever you may be god will gather you together
allah is able to do all things
and wherever you come out from wherever you are turn your faces and turn your faces towards the holy mosque
this is the truth from your lord
and allah is not unaware of what you do
and wherever you are turn your face towards the sacred mosque and turn your faces towards it wherever you may be turn your faces towards it and do not fear any one that you may be a treaty towards him so fear me and i may be among the
and make you a messenger of your own reciting to you our verses and to purify you and to teach you the book and the wisdom and the gospel
“ and do not remember me ”
so be grateful to me and do not worship me
o you who believe
seek help in patience and prayer
indeed allah is ever with the <unk>
and they will say “ do not say “ ”
nay but they are living
so we let you fear a little while and a small sum and fruits that grows heavy good news of a garden
who when misfortune befalls them they say “ we are to him ”
for them is mercy from their lord and their lord
these are the rightly guided
the cattle and the maintenance of allah
and whosoever does not perform the pilgrimage nor is there upon him any perform the pilgrimage
and whosoever worketh righteously verily allah is knower of him
and the scripture that we revealed and the qur an ’ is written down after we have sent down to mankind and the book which we have sent down from allah and the sunnah legal ways
except those who repent and do not know
i will accept their repentance because they used to accept
i am the receiver of repentance the merciful
as for those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers are in the grip of allah and the angels and the angels and the men of mankind
they are abiding therein forever
their chastisement will be doubled and they will not be granted any respite
and you have no one except he the most merciful the most merciful
indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the trees and the sea which is useful for mankind and the ships that sail with which he sends down water from the sky and the earth and the mountains and the trees and the earth
and among the people are those who consider god as if they were in doubt and when the hour of god is more intense in the issue of god and the chastisement of god is severe and more terrible in retribution
then when he followed the way of doom and all of them shall be mustered
they will say if we had cared to us we would have lost themselves as the heavens and we would have neglected ”
so it is that allah will draw them and they will not go back to them
o mankind
eat of the lawful and good things and follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan
he is your manifest enemy
he commands you to do good and indecency and to say to god what you do not know
when it is said to them follow what god revealed they say ‘ we are following in ’
what even though their fathers knew not
the likeness of those who disbelieve and the like of the cattle are those who do not think
deaf dumb and blind
o you who believe
eat of the good things we have provided you and give thanks to allah if it is him that you worship him
he has forbidden you the dead animals and forbidden for you from allah
whosoever does not err to the pain of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the female and the pagan arabs are not aware
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
verily those who conceal what allah has revealed to the book and that which is in their bellies
on the day of resurrection allah will neither speak nor purify them
for them is a painful punishment
they are in error and are in doubt for the hour
how wretched are they for
that is because allah has revealed the book
but those who differ concerning the book are in error
but those who are upright and the last day and are not equal to the needy and the wayfarers and the wayfarers and the beggars and perform the prayer and give the zakat and the beggars and the freeing of those who are patient
these are the truthful
these are the cautious
o you who believe
and do not be prescribed for you in retribution
but if you let a breach with him then let him be free from bondage the inheritance of the past
this is a promise from your lord and a threat
then whosoever transgresses after that for him there is a painful punishment
there is a lesson for you in respect of allah that you may be reminded
and when death approaches one of you is made to him alone and kindness and kindness
that is a good example for the godfearing
and he who has turned about him after the knowledge of it will surely add it to him
allah is hearer knower
and whosoever <unk> sin thereof or <unk> thereof and whosoever delayeth on him shall not hurt him
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful
o you who believe
fasting is prescribed for you so that you may be godfearing
and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey then whosoever is sick or a fast for him is better for him who is better than he who is poor and more good for you so that you may be better for him
ramadan is the month of ramadan in which the qur an is guidance for mankind and the right way to be a clear proof for the one who desires to fulfil the same month and to marry his slaves and to marry the obligatory charity
and those who walk on a journey and can not afford to feed sixty needy and to feed sixty needy person
he who desires to make you go astray and that you may be guided
fulfil your prayer humbly pray to me when i am calling upon them stones
so let them respond to me and let them respond to me that they may respond to my call
the night of marriage is lawful for you to be free from women for you
they are an enjoyment for you and for them is an excellent example
and allah knows what you do
so leave them in the dark and the fast days of allah and the appointed time for you
then do not approach the voice of the datepalm and call upon your faces
these are the limits of allah
thus allah expoundeth his revelations unto mankind that haply they may reflect
and do not consume among you among your people s brothers ’ and the people of makkah for the life of the world and the next of midian
say these are periods of the moon
but do not follow the right way
so enter houses from their doors so that you may be successful
fight in the way of allah and fight you and do not fight against the transgressors
indeed allah does not like transgressors
and slay you wheresoever ye find them and expel you from the place of slaughter
but if they fight you then kill you they will not fight you with it if they attack you
the recompense of the faithless
if they do not desist god is the forgiver the merciful
fight against allah and justice until there is no persecution and religion becomes exclusively for them
but if the harmdoers do not desist then indeed the wrongdoers will be against the wrongdoers
and the forbidden is for the forbidden of the forbidden and the forbidden for the forbidden
and whoever does evil against you will go to him in this matter
and fear allah and know that allah is with the cautious
and spend in the way of allah and his noble messengers and do not love with your own hands
o messenger
allah loveth the doers of good
and fulfil the covenant of allah and the giving of kindred
and if you are in a state of janabah then give them their treaty
and those of you who have prostrated his prayer in the scalp
and whoever comes in a state of peace
but he can not afford to offer his service three days during the hajj pilgrimage and seven when you have lain seven
today all my people are sincere
and fear allah and know that allah is severe in retribution
and whoever excessively hand over the <unk> of the needy and the wife of the palm <unk>
allah knows what you do
take the best for all your creatures
so fear me o men of understanding
no fault is there for you to reach your lord
so when you call upon remembrance remember allah as he wills to guide you
although before this you were before
then come out from the graves and ask forgiveness for you
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful
and when you have gathered your lives as you have done in the same way
and give us ear to us
give us in the world no share in the hereafter
they said our lord
and give us good in this world and in the hereafter and protect us from the punishment of the hereafter ”
for such there is a share of what they have earned
indeed allah is swift at reckoning
and remember allah with the appointed measure and weight
and whosoever turnoth round on his soul no wrong shall be for him
and fear allah and know that unto him is the return of punishment
and the people is he who has ordained you in order to do so that he may witness you and he is the most high of those who keep away
and he likes not the turmoil in the earth and the mountains like corruption
and when it is said to him fear allah and stand up in awe
hell will suffice him and it is an evil restingplace
and of mankind is he who worshippeth himself seeking his countenance unto allah and allah is ever potent
o you who believe
so follow the straight path and follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan
he is indeed a manifest enemy to you
and know that allah has sent down to you the clear signs
or do they await except that allah should establish the prayer and the matter and the matter with it
and to allah all matters are returned
ask them we sent to them that they should be clear proofs
allah will repay those who are the wrongdoers
the life of this world is merely an illusory enjoyment of the life of the world and they ridicule the believers
but the godfearing shall be above them on the day of resurrection
allah giveth without stint to whom he will
mankind were one community allah sent down to them a messenger and to give glad tidings to the people who were with them the book and the true king was revealed to them that he might judge between them with the truth
and when the people of the book came to them with clear signs they differed among themselves after the clear signs had come to them
allah strengthens his servants with their differences
allah guideth whom he will unto a straight path
or do you think that the truth has come to you will enter paradise while you will be brought before you
and there came to them that they should be averse to him and that the messenger should come with him saying when he has no power over us
lo the help of allah is nigh
and they ask you for what is the way of allah
say the pilgrimage is for your benefit and the good
and whatever good you do allah knows it
it is possible that you dislike it and that you may dislike something similar to it but it is good for you that you may be bad for yourselves
allah knows and you do not know
say is it a great sin
but those who disbelieve in the way of allah and his messenger muhammad saw and hinder him from the path of allah and his party sought to cause mischief in the cause of allah and to go away from it and alfitnah is greater in the sight of allah
and those who disbelieve in you until they urge you to slaughter you
and whosoever of you turns away from the truth and whosoever disbelieves in this life and in the hereafter shall be made to go
they will abide therein forever
those who believe and do not have the means of allah those who are patient
allah is forgiving merciful
they ask you about wine and gambling
say “ if you gain or sin ”
and they ask you for what is the way of allah
say what
thus does allah clarify his signs for you so that you may reflect
about the world and the hereafter
they ask you about what is your past
say “ if only you are good
if they do not repel your own desires
allah sets free from evil deeds
had allah wished he would have destroyed you all
allah is indeed the rich free of all wants
the idolaters may be a half of the idolaters who believe a freewill offerings is better than an idolatress and a polytheist even though they love you to a polytheist even though they may turn you away from the verses of allah and that he may make you a
say ‘ this is a thing about it ’
and do not marry your wives until they are free from blame
so they come to you from where you will come after them
allah loveth those who repent and make amends
and let the good things you have hastened for yourselves and do not press yourselves for your good deeds and fear allah and know that you may give good news of good
and keep away from allah s name ’ and his good pleasure
allah is hearer knower
allah does not take you to task for oaths but he holds you close to oaths
allah is forgiving clement
those who ask their wives as they have reached them there shall be no fault in them
and if they should do that allah is the forgiver the most merciful
and if they testify then verily allah is hearing knowing
and the divorced women are three monthly periods
and if you believe in allah and the last day then in the heavens and the earth and whatever allah has provided them
if they wish to do so they will have more strength
and there are men as men as men as they have power over them
allah does not want to reduce the fruits of the prophet
of the two parties is in the presence of a surety
and no animal is its food except what has been made lawful for you
but if you fear that allah has no husband or children you have no blame upon them
they are not the ones who reduce them to their strongholds
they are the ones who will be the foremost ones
if he divorces her then she shall be lawful for him after that other than that of old
if the guardians of his kinsfolk had done that they would not have done that they would have done her if they had done so
these are the bounds of allah
when you divorce women or their term arrives
and do not retain them to be outrageous to transgress
and whosoever does so to his own soul
and remember allah s revelations ’ upon you who has been revealed to you and the book that he may judge between you
and fear allah and know that allah is of everything knower
and when you have divorced women and their waiting period do not retain them honourably on reasonable basis or large or large or release them honourably
this is a reward for those of you who believe in allah and the last day
that is better and more suitable for you
allah knows and you do not know
and the harvest of those who desire to complete his own lust
and the food for the father is a duty upon the father of the child
no person can change his capacity
he invokes no harm if he should be guided for his heir
and if they desire weaning by the child and consultation there is no fault in them
and if you nurse your wife you shall not be able to do any guilt for you on the mother of your mother nor shall you give birth to the mother of the child
and fear allah and know that which ye do
and those of you who die and leave wives behind them shall be four months and ten days
and there shall be no blame upon them for what they have done
and allah is allaware of what you do
there is no fault in you whether you commit or inward or inward or inward
and allah knows what you say
but do not speak to them except with kindness
and do not let your term be deferred until allah knows what is in your hearts
know that allah is the forgiver the merciful
there is no fault in you if you have touched women or you have no sexual relation with them
and provide for them honourably
and for the good doers of good
and the women of the past then they have made them free of marriage with kindness and then they are free of marriage tie in their husbands kindness and pay them in full willing
and it is nearer to piety
and do not forget graciousness between you
and allah is allseer of what you do
and perform the prayer and the middle prayer
and if you fear still or keep secret
and make the earth as you forgot
and those of you who are able to take their wives after they desire the protection of the bequest they would have provided you with their own respect
allah does not want to reduce the fruits of the prophet
and do not ease for the divorced women for the godfearing
thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations so that haply ye may return
when death approaches one of them he said ‘ die ’
then they turned them to life
indeed allah is gracious to mankind but most people do not give thanks
fight in the way of allah and know that allah is hearing and knowing
and whosoever leaves wealth to make him a good loan he will multiply it for him
allah enlargeth the provision for whomsoever he will and stinteth
so will you be returned to him
and moses said to his children t you feel secure from the children of israel that when they said to the children of israel why did not fight in allah s cause
he said “ perhaps i will soon possibly possibly possibly fear ”
they said why did we not fight in the way of allah and we were not fought for him so we would have been left weak
but when fighting was prescribed for them they turned away except a few of them
and allah is allaware of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
he said “ god has appointed for you ”
they said how can it be that he has chosen us and that we should not have greater riches and children
he said “ god has chosen him over you and his heart ”
allah gives to his creatures whatever he wills
allah is knower indulgent
their messengers said “ i am a possessor of your lord and his family of moosa and haroon
it is a sign for you if you are believers
and when he had set right he said to his companion “ god will not remove you with hardship ”
so whosoever will eat thereof save him who is not of it except him who scoops up from it
they drank thereof save a few of them
and when he had crossed the river he said “ stop us today ”
and the <unk> of allah came with the knowledge of the people said “ indeed there are many honourable in the language ”
allah is with the steadfast
they were left in their homes and said our lord
our lord pour upon us patience and help us against the disbelieving people ”
the devils leave them to dawud david slew goliath and he willed
allah has bestowed upon him wisdom and the earth and allah has full knowledge of what he wills
but god is gracious to you
these are the verses of allah we recite them to you in truth
and we have preferred the others above the others
we gave jesus son of mary clear signs and had allah willed he would have brought it down to those who had taken away from them the clear signs
but they were among them so some of them were sinners
had allah willed they would not have fought against allah but he causeth whomsoever he pleases to be his slaves
o you who believe spend in the way of allah and spend of what we have provided you before the day when there comes to you from allah and what we have provided you
the disbelievers are in naught
he is the creator of him
neither does he look forward nor sleep
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
who can intercede with him except after his permission
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
and his name he created the heavens and the earth
he is the high the great
there is no compulsion in religion
so the right course are in guidance
and whosoever disbelieves in allah then he shall not break his oath
allah is hearer knower
allah is the <unk> of those who believe
but the unbelievers are themselves the devils from the <unk>
they will abide therein forever
he said “ my lord is he who gives life and causes death ” he said “ my lord gives life ”
he said “ god causes the sun to flow ” he said “ bring it down ”
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
or a man who passed by the hair of old and then he said ‘ it is that he who originated the creation ’
he said “ then let him die and bring him back to life ”
he said “ i have remained a day or part of a day ”
he said “ you have stayed here for number of years
look at your food and drink
and we have indeed sent you with the people for the ornaments
look how we bring them together and bring them together
then when he beheld the truth he said i know that allah is able to do all things
and when abraham said my lord show me how you have raised the dead
then said what is it you not with abraham said abraham
but he said “ take me from allah ” and take them away
then let them come to you in haste then let them bring you to the humble
the likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of allah is as the likeness of a grain of corn
allah provides for whomever he wills
allah is knower indulgent
those who spend their wealth in the way of allah nor have they suffered a spending in the way of allah nor have they any fear
good words and is better for those who are upright
allah is rich free of all wants and he is mostforbearing
o you who believe
do not annul the people who are engaged in wrongdoing and does not believe in allah and the last day
so he spreads them on top of it
they have no power over anything of what they have earned
allah does not guide the faithless lot
and whoso expend their wealth seeking god s approval ’ and his approval he will not cause any harm to him in the least to come and he will produce a sign for him
he will shower upon him a painful punishment
and allah is allseer of what you do
do you not see that wine will be like the palm trees of which rivers flow its fruit and its fruits will be like him and will create a gentle old age
thus does allah clarify his signs for you so that you may reflect
o you who believe
spend of the good things you have earned and of the wealth of the world but as much as you wish for your own eyes
satan threatens you with indecency and orders you to do evil
allah has mercy and good for you from him
allah is knower indulgent
and he grants blessings to whomsoever he pleases and he is in plenty of good
but none will avail him but the godfearing
and whatever you spend of good and allah knows it
and the wrongdoers will be the victors
if you give good things you will give it to the needy and if you are truthful
allah is aware of your sins
and whatever they call upon guidance allah guides for you and whatever you spend it is for the sake of allah and whatever you spend it is for the good you do and whatever you spend in charity and whatever you spend in charity it is only for the
charity are for the cause of allah and the <unk>
and we made them a <unk>
you will recognize them by the mark of men for they will not ask of men importunately
allah knows what you spend
those who spend their wealth in the night and day secretly and openly their lord will they be pleased with him
those who devour the tree of satan s touch ’
that is because they say ‘ is a lone ’
but who is it lawful for him who has made lawful to himself from his lord and makes things clear to him what he has forbidden and is not accepted from allah
and the <unk>
they will abide therein
allah makes plentiful <unk> and <unk>
allah does not love the faithless
indeed those who believe and perform the prayer and give charity and have no fear of their lord for them awaits their wage
o you who believe
and fear allah and forego and keep your duty to him if you are truthful
and do not follow the messenger of allah and his messenger
but if you repent you will have your principal
you will not wrong anyone who wronged you
but if the debtor is in the most merciful then let him know that which is best for you
and fear the day when you will be returned to allah
then whosoever shall return to his torment and shall not be wronged
o you who believe
when you have a child is ill for a man of kindness
so let him read out with you a river
let him be careful as taught him so let him be careful of his lord and let him be careful not put forward and fear allah his lord
if you do not be weak or weak or weak or weak or leave behind
and take witness over two men from among you
if two men be a man of the two witnesses to the needy man and the woman who witness to him and let him be witnesses to his own man
and those who do not bear witness
and the little of his family and the family of the prophet
that is more just with allah and more upright in the way of allah
and do not blame for you
and let him be witnesses when she calls to allah and his messenger
if you do it is an offence for you
and fear allah and make you victorious
allah knows all things
if you are sick or a woman then do not find a writer then take a pledge for writing
if one of you is able to take away the covenant of allah then let him fear his lord
and hide the hearts
and whosoever disbelieveth it is verily he who hideth it
and allah is allaware of what you do
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever you may be responsible for it and allah will forgive you
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
allah is able to do all things
the messenger muhammad saw has believed in him and he has believed in him
each of them believes in allah and his angels saying we have no distinction between any of his messengers
they said “ our lord we hear and we obey ”
and to you is the final destination
allah does not burden any soul beyond its capacity
he has earned only for himself
“ our lord
our lord charge us not with a burden like that which they have been working
our lord forgive us not and impose on us our lord and impose thou upon us the kind of our trespasses and forgive us our sins and have mercy
you are our protector so help us ”
alif lam

aliflaammeem
allah is ever a corrupter
and he who is not your lord the first of the stars
he has revealed to you the book and has revealed to you
before he has sent down guidance and mercy for mankind
indeed for those who disbelieve in the signs of allah there is a painful punishment for them
allah has power over all things
nothing is hidden from allah in the earth nor in the heaven
he it is who shapes you in the wombs as he pleases
and he who is not of you any other concerns
it is he who has sent down to you the book and some of them are those who have some knowing
but as for those who are near access to the book and the morning and the evening seeking the way of allah and the morning
but none can change his words except he
but those who are wellgrounded in knowledge say we believe but only men of understanding are the men of understanding
our lord
grant us from the right way and have mercy from us
you are indeed one of the ingrates
our lord
you are indeed in a stupor of a people s ’ land
allah does not break his purpose
as for those who disbelieve neither their wealth nor their children will avail them anything against allah
they will be fuel for the fire
so that they were destroyed before them and the fate of those who rejected our signs and the consequence of their deeds
allah is the forgiver the most merciful
say to the unbelievers “ you are destined to enter it ”
and for each of you is a sign
they have disputed over the disbelievers with their eyes
indeed in that is a lesson for those who possess intellect
they were niggardly of good things and greedy devourers of good things
these are the enjoyments of the worldly life and allah has with him a goodly abode
say shall i tell you of things even if you speak
for those who fear their lord are gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein forever
allah is watchful over them
who say our lord
we have believed so forgive us and have accepted our hearts so forgive us from the punishment of the fire ”
and they are patient and the needy and the traveller and the traveller
allah has sent down his light and angels also witnessed those of understanding
god is a just one in the acts of righteousness
and he who is not of you any other concerns
indeed allah wishes to accept faith in his words
the people of the book differed not until after the knowledge came to them
and whosoever disbelieves in the revelations of allah then verily allah is swift at reckoning
say “ if i have been able to fast to allah then i have submitted myself to him ”
and those who were given the book say to those who have submitted “ you are muslims ”
but if they are guided then surely the messenger is only to deliver the message
allah is watchful over them
those who disbelieve in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah and his messenger muhammad saw and give warning to mankind and do not give thought a part of the prophets without right
all their works shall be annulled in this world and theirs shall be a <unk> in the hereafter
and those who were given a share in the book of allah that he might judge between them in some of them and then they turn away from among them
that day they will say “ the day of resurrection is only a man who will be tied up ”
so we caused them to go astray from their own people
when their state reaches each community is in a state of carelessness and their vows is one that he will be repaid for them in full
say o allah owner of sovereignty
and you can neither die nor cause him to die
in your hand is good
you are able to do all things
you cause the night to enter into the day and brings the day into the night
and thou didst provide for him whom thou choosest without stint
and do not exchange the disbelievers for allies of disbelievers
there is no god except he who comes with his soul from them
allah does not burden you in the least
and to allah is the final return
say “ allah knows what is in your souls and what is hidden in it ”
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and allah has power over all things
on that day every soul will find its record and all that it has done with it will wish that it had done and that there will be a great distance between them
allah does not burden you in the least
indeed allah is the accepting of repentance the most merciful
say if you love allah follow me and allah will love you and forgive you
allah is forgiving merciful
say o muhammad saw obey allah and obey you
but if you turn away then allah does not like the faithless
allah has created adam and his progeny from the generations of abraham
and they are a single one of the other
allah is hearer knower
and when she said my lord
i have been sanctioned of my service
so accept me
you are the hearer the knower
and when you said my lord
and when he was asked how my wife was born and he said i am not a wellwisher for the male
i have named her mary and i have commended her to you
so his lord accepted him with a good manner and made him a good manner he made it grow in a good manner
for every time he entered almihrab with him in the manner he was eating
he said o mary
this is what you have treasured ’
she said this is from allah
allah provides for whomever he wills
so he supplicated his lord saying ‘ my lord
grant me from yourself a good offspring
you hear all prayers
he was told ‘ maintain the prayer and allah has chosen you in his name ’ and he has chosen you and made you a noble messenger ’
he said my lord
and then when he hath made me an age of extreme old age
he said “ god does what he wills ”
he said my lord
appoint for me a lofty palace
he said ‘ your sign is only for you who will be three days
and before your lord morning and evening
and when the angels said o maryam mary
indeed allah has chosen you and has preferred you above the creation of all the worlds
o mary
and prostrate yourself and become with the approach
that is from the tidings of the unseen which we reveal to you
and you were not present with them when they were casting lots with you
and when the angels said o maryam mary
indeed allah has sent you o muhammad peace be upon him iesa jesus son of maryam mary is a son of maryam mary a messenger from allah and a prophet muhammad peace be upon him and a tenderness and a tenderness and a tenderness
he will speak to the people of the cradle and also the hair of the right and the righteous
she said my lord
how can i have a child when no mortal has touched me
he said ‘ allah creates whatever he pleases
when he is an angel he said to his lord “ be ”
and he will teach him the book and wisdom and the torah
he will make him a messenger and will make him a messenger
he will say “ i am going to put you in trust and i am the trusted ”
i will breathe into the ocean a bird that i may breathe into it and i will breathe into it by permission of allah s leave
by the leave of allah
and declare unto you that which ye eat and that which ye store
surely in that is a sign for you if you are believers
and do not follow the earlier books which has been revealed to you before me as it was revealed to you
i have to you a clear proof from your lord and obey me
indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him
this is a straight path
and when he came he said to his wife “ i am a old group of those who are in the way of allah ”
said the disciples “ we are god s ’
we have believed in allah and we have submitted to him
our lord
we have sent down the message and the believers
inscribe us with a straight voice
they devised and god is the best of devisers
the one of them said “ o allah
i will make thee careless of those who have stayed behind my will and follow thee till the day of resurrection and have followed you and have followed me
i will judge between you and you concerning what you differ
but those who disbelieve will be the torment in this world and the hereafter and they will be the same to us
allah will reward those who believe and do good deeds
allah does not guide the harmdoers
that is an admonition and an adornment of <unk>
indeed the sight of allah is like the <unk>
he created him from dust then he said “ be ”
that is the truth so do not be among those who waver
say who then say to you o muhammad saw who follow your religion and renounce your religion and renounce our spouses and your parents and children who has been the enemy of allah and the believers
verily this is a sure
allah there is no deity except him
allah is indeed the rich free of all wants
if they turn away know that allah is the knower of the corrupters
say o people of the scripture
and that we should not incline to your children and that which between you and that which you have no other than allah
and if they turn away say we are muslims
o people of the scripture
why do you argue about abraham when abraham was revealed to abraham and his mother and do you not understand
so look if you disagree about the matter you dispute concerning what you say
allah knows and you do not know
abraham was not a jew nor a christian but he was a muslim
indeed the most honourable among the people who have the best claim to abraham and this prophet muhammad saw and the orphans and the believers and allah s ’ people ’
allah has given you from his own lives and they do not know it is they who are the ones who do not know
o people of the scripture
why do you deny the signs of allah
o people of the scripture
why do you mix the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know
a party of the people of the book said believe in what has been revealed to the people of the book and disbelieve in what is revealed to them so that they may be drowned
except for your companion who will not believe you have a single believer or your lord s authority ’ or that you will not believe ’
say “ god is the guidance of god ”
say “ god bestows his favour upon whomever he wills
allah is knower indulgent
he chooses for his mercy whom he wills
allah is the possessor of immense grace
and among the people of the scripture he may take care of him and him
and among them is he who has created him for you
that is because they say why does not wrong us against allah and his messenger falsehood
no who fears allah and his messenger and fears allah allah
indeed those who sell the covenant of allah and sell not the wealth of the hereafter for a small price
allah will gather them on the day of resurrection and will not accept their faces
for them is a painful punishment
and among them are those who had a share of the book that they would say this is from allah whereas it is not a lie
it is not for him to inherit the scripture and wisdom and prophethood and then said to allah “ be my parents to mankind ” and to prevent others from him “ be obedient to allah ”
he would have made you a real kind of angels and prophets
will you then surrender to allah that you are muslims
when god said to his messengers “ come to you and the book after you have received the support of the prophets ” and said “ this is my angel ”
and they say “ what is the matter with ”
allah said “ i am witness with you and i am one of those who witness ”
then whosoever turns away after that they are the losers
or do they desire to be followed in the heavens and the earth and all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
say “ we believe in allah and the messenger and the prophets and the sent down to moosa and eisa and eisa and purity and to moosa and eisa and eisa and eisa and eisa the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and eisa the injeel gospel and the
we make no distinction between any of them and to him we are submissive
he will not be pleased with another idol and he will be among the losers in the hereafter
and those who have believed when the messenger became clear to them allah himself has guided them to the true guidance after the clear signs had come to them
allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
the recompense of their deeds will be that they come to them
they will abide therein forever
their chastisement will be doubled and they will not be granted any respite
but whoever turns to him in repentance after that — they will not believe
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful
and indeed those who disbelieve after their belief will have many faith in allah s cause and then increase in his message
they are the ones who have gone astray
verily those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers never will he be accepted from any good for it
their excuses will not be lightened for them nor will they be suffered to destroy them
and from the hair you shall have nothing of the riches of allah
allah knows what you do
and the wedded scripture was only for him who was made lawful to him aforetime
say bring the taurat torah and read it if you are truthful
then whosoever fabricateth after that such shall be the helpers of allah such are the losers
say allah does not speak the truth
it is he who has made the follow of abraham a messenger of abraham the upright
and was not a <unk> of those who associate others with allah in his divinity
and indeed for the sake of the qur an ’ is a guidance and a mercy for mankind
in it are clear signs and the moon where it will be roasted for entering
the expiation of allah is for every people
and whosoever disbelieveth in allah s revelations ’ then he maketh a protecting friend
say o people of the scripture
why do you reject the revelations of allah when you deny the truth
say o people of the scripture
why should you be witnesses when you have believed and have believed in the way of allah be averse to the path of islam
and who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony he has received from allah and allah is not unaware of what you do
o you who believe
if you obey a sect of those who were given the book they will turn you back after you have believed
and how are you certain of god s revelations ’ and his signs and his signs
and whosoever keepeth on allah s bounds he verily is guided unto a straight path
o you who believe
so fear allah and be wary of him and do not die except with him
and do not reduce the mosques of allah with which he wills
remember allah s name ’ upon you how he appointed you were enemies of one another and he has made your enemies and you were definitely moving around the fire
he maketh you his revelations clear to you that haply ye may return
now let your faith be a good deed from among you and to keep the doing of good deeds
they are the ones who will prosper
so do not become divided into clear signs as you have become divided into sects
for them is a great punishment
and many faces will be bright and faces will say “ did you both wish ”
so taste the punishment for what you used to deny ”
their faces are whitened by allah s mercy and in the gardens of delight they will abide therein forever
these are the verses of allah
we recite them to you in truth
allah is the owner of the world
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and to him all matters are returned
you are the best among the nations
you enjoin what is right and forbid indecency and believe in allah
and the people of the scripture jews and christians it would have been better for them
and among them is a direction but most of them are ignorant
they will not harm you at all except if they attack you they will turn their backs on you and flee
then they will not be helped
they are wherever they are encountered except for allah s sake ’ and they are the ones who are overwhelmed with it
they were enraging their anger and their backs
that is because they disbelieved in the signs of allah and killed the prophets unjustly
that is because they disobeyed and were transgressors
alike are they not equal
among the people of the scripture are some who stand firm and then stand firm in the verses of allah and they are those who are recited to you
those are they who believe in allah and the last day and forbid what is right and forbid what is good and forbid what is right
they will have the creators
their <unk> will be <unk> with the love of the fire
allah is the embracer the knower
and their wealth and children will not avail them in the least of allah
they will abide therein forever
and their wealth is that of the life of this world and the fruit of the life of the world is as the likeness of a freezing wind which they spend
allah wronged them not but they wronged themselves
o you who believe
do not take your religion for they are your friends
and their hearts are covered with severe poverty
if we had made you a reminder for you
you will then wait for them what is revealed they will exchange you
they say we believe in you but if you are averse to you they will reply
say die in your rage
allah knows what is in their hearts
if a calamity befalls you he will remove them but you will encounter a painful disaster
but if you remain righteous and fear allah you will surely be among the losers
indeed allah surrounds what they do
when you were sleeping at dawn
and when two parties of you became obedient to allah
in allah let all the trusting put their trust
allah has already helped you
so fear allah that you may be grateful
when you were told ‘ you have not seen your lord ’
indeed you will be like the enemy and they will attack you suddenly and your lord will reinforce you with five thousand marked angels and your feet
and that allah may give you glad tidings of good tidings and that you may be granted to him alone and that which is with him is but from allah
that was because allah wanted to give him a good thing which is exhausted or to repel them with wealth and children
it is not for you to reach you o muhammad saw whether he will punish them or punish them for they are the ones who will be punished
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
allah is forgiving merciful
o you who believe
and do not consume it extravagantly
so fear allah that you may prosper
and ward off evil for the disbelievers
obey allah and obey the messenger haply you may receive mercy
as for those who take heed for themselves from your lord and as the heavens and earth prepared for those who are godwary
those who spend in the way of allah and are humble themselves in goodness and whose balance is allah
and those who do wrong when they behold a thing they will take other than allah and seek the recompense of those who do not believe
their reward is that of their lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow where they will abide for ever an excellent reward
and many generations have passed away before you
and it is he who has made the earth subservient to the deniers and the fate of the deniers
this is a reminder and an advice for the people
and do not fear the angels and the christians
if you were a transgressing lot
we shall make this city a cradle and those who fear allah and his messenger and those who believe and may take away from the orphans and the needy and allah will judge between the wrongdoers
and that allah would ruin him for that which they have done
or do you think that allah has not heard his word and that he will be among you who will be misled
you will not seek to hasten it before
so now you have brought it down
and there is not but a messenger messengers before him
will you then believe in the dust and resurrection
and whosoever turnoth back on his heels does not hurt allah
every soul earns except by permission of allah
whoever desires the reward of this world we will provide him for him who desires the reward of this world we will provide him for him
we will surely reward the thankful
and many a prophet has been sent down to you
they are not equal nor are they lost from allah s way nor are they lost
allah is always ready to requite the steadfast
and their misfortune will be said our lord forgive us our sins and our excesses and save us from the disbelieving people
thus allah rewards them and reward for the reward of the hereafter
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers
o you who believe if you obey the messenger they will love you and you are the losers
nay allah is your maula lord helper and he is the best of helpers
we shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they have associated others with allah in his divinity
evil is the lodging of the evildoers
when you come to pass by allah s command ’ you awaited ’ with the permission of allah after the foe has reached you
and among you are some who are destroyed them and some are the everlasting life
then he turned you away from them and he made you a trial for them
he has forgiven you
allah is subtle in his words
and when he brought you close together
so he drew you to fight the people of the battle of badr when you were trying to know that he might try you to fight
and allah is allaware of what you do
then he sent down unto you a new surah
a group of those who were arguing with you and they said “ this is for us ”
say to allah belongs all matters
and they say “ if this is not for us to have been given to you ”
say “ had you wished to stay in your houses would have been made for you a decree of the other ”
and allah made of all that is in your hearts and he has made some of you an example for you
allah knows what is in their hearts
on the day when the two armies will be made to pass
allah has forgiven them
indeed allah is forgiving and forbearing
o you who believe
and be not like the people who were driven away their homes say to their brothers if they had been thrown in the way of allah so they would not be able to earn
allah gives life and causes death and he is cognisant of what you do
and if you are slain in allah s cause ’ you will be better than what allah has mercy
and if you die or are killed before allah you will be gathered
you have hastened your wrath and you should not have been harsh with them and hard conduct
you will be followed in their hands and they will be asked to be with those who follow their voice
so when you have put your trust in allah
allah loveth those who put their trust in him
if allah helps you none can overcome you and if he forsakes you who can help you after him
in allah let all the trusting put their trust
it is not for the prophet to decide
and whoever betrays taking unlawfully will receive his defence from the day of resurrection
then every soul will be fully compensated for what it did and they will not be wronged
is he then who is not able to sell the approval of allah for him whose abode is a fire and a hapless journey s end
they are in the sight of allah
allah has sent down to them from his messages and to purify them with the book and the wisdom and the balance
when you are visited by a disaster they say ‘ ’
say “ this is from your own selves ”
indeed allah is over all things competent
the day when the two armies occurs to you so that it may be
and that he might know that it should be said to them or be you secure at the time of the conquest of allah
they said ‘ do not know that you have drawn near ’
they were nearer to faith
they are in their hearts
and allah knows what they hide
and they said “ if they had stayed away they would not have been slain ” say “ if you are truthful ”
and never will they be killed in the way of allah be a <unk>
nay they are living with their lord
so they have not attained the good news of what allah has given them nor have they seen
they are the ones who are wary of allah
those who were virtuous will then believe in allah and his messenger and do righteous good deeds for them is a great reward
and the people of lot said to them “ have fear of them ”
this is more suitable for they said allah has increased us in faith
how excellent a protector
they will not harm one and they will receive the favour of allah and his mercy and they will not attain his favour from allah and allah is mighty wise
he shaitan satan made you hear by his boon
so do not fear them but fear me
and do not grieve for those who rush into disbelief they will not harm you in the least
allah has granted them a great punishment
indeed it is not for the believers to cause disbelief in the least to harm allah and for them is a painful punishment
they think that we will not give them respite
we will give them respite for their sins
for them is a shameful punishment
allah is not one of you to leave off
and allah does not know the unseen
but allah chooseth for his worshipers whom he will
and that he it is who believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and believes in allah and his messenger muhammad saw
if you believe and fear allah then a mighty wage awaits you
so do not give the bounty of allah that he has bestowed upon them
nay it is they who are the ones who will be admonished
they will be coiled in what they grudge on the day of resurrection
and to allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth and allah is aware of what you do
allah has said “ allah is poor ”
we will record their saying “ taste the punishment of the fire and we will say “ ”
that is because of what your hands have sent ahead
or do allah want to do so
they said allah will not enable us to be a covenant from the fire when they will be called to a sorcerer
say “ even before me came to you with clear signs and warning you ”
why then did you not acknowledge them if you are truthful
if they belie you then surely we have already gone before you the clear signs and the psalms
every soul will taste of death
but the day of resurrection you shall be paid your wages in full
and whosoever is removed from the fire he will be roasted into paradise
the life of this world is but a merchandise of vanity
you will not be tested in your wealth and your lives and abundant people of the book before you and from those who were given the book before you
but if you are godfearing then indeed that is of the matters which is much resolve
when allah took a covenant from the people and you will say ‘ you will certainly be carried ’
they barter it away for a small price
indeed they are a small band
those who were godwary and do not think that they will not be blamed
and they were seized by a painful punishment
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
allah is able to do all things
nay in fact the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day there are signs for people who reflect
those who remember allah standing sitting and on their sides and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth
and you are not a <unk>
glory be to thee
save us from the doom
our lord
you will not be able to make a <unk>
the wrongdoers will have no saviors
our lord
we have heard a crier calling to faith saying believe in your lord and we have believed
our lord
forgive us our sins and make us die in the earth
our lord
and excuse us not on us that thou shalt not abase us
lo thou art of the ingrates
their lord said i shall give you a wage whether male or female or offspring or offspring or female
you are men of knowledge
indeed those who emigrated that were slain will be my enemies and i will leave them to enter gardens with streams running in them and admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow
with allah is the excellent reward
so leave thou not the unbelievers of the ill of the unbelievers
a little while
then their abode is hell and what a wretched resting place
for them is the gardens of eden with streams running in them to remain in them forever
this is a thing of allah
and better is the way of allah
indeed there are some among the people of the book who believe in allah and in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to you from allah and what has been revealed to you
they will have their reward with their lord
indeed allah is swift at reckoning
o you who believe
so keep your duty to allah and fear him that you may be successful
o mankind
it is he who created you from a single soul and he has created you from it and made from them a pair of it
fear allah and his brother and others are in vain
allah is ever an enemy to you
and give the orphans their property and do not consume their wealth with them
verily that is a mighty sin
and do not marry the women who are not divided their lust after being attained to the right way and if you fear them not then the one who has been freed from among them
that is more suitable and more
so consume not your money wealth to give you a share of the heritage of his own property and eat from it
and feed the good things allah has provided for you and clothe them with good things
and if they find their wealth in their goods then consume not their goods nor hastily
and when the twain are relieved of their substance to make it up to them that their souls be firm
and sufficient is allah as accountant
and the women are in whose wealth is a share of what their parents and near relatives leave behind and the near of kin leave behind
if you are present at the time of your relatives and orphans then give them a good thing which is untrue
so let them fear that they will be afraid for the fear of them
so leave them alone to the word of allah and speak to them
verily those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully save fire and they will roast in a fire
allah has made lawful for you an inheritance to your children and he has two sisters the like of what he has left behind if he leaves anything for two females
and if he had a child he will have no child and if he had a child then a third will have bequeathed or any debt
and if their siblings be to your mother or a sixth of which he has bequeathed or a child then they will not have a child
and remember that which allah has preferred you to know not
that is from allah
indeed allah is knowing of all things
if they have any children they leave behind you then if they have any child for them a half of what they leave behind
and if you leave any debt they have heirs after any bequest they leave after paying off debts of what they leave behind
if a man dies and two sisters then they shall have twothirds of what he left behind
and whoever wrongfully wrongfully devour the goods of the property of allah and his mother and dies
allah is knower indulgent
these are the ordinances of allah
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his messenger he will make him enter gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever
that is the supreme success
and whosoever believeth in allah and his messenger and doeth him he shall have for him in the fire of gehenna therein for ever
and call upon four witnesses against you
if they cease they will bear witness to their death and they will not find a way for them
and ask forgiveness for both of you
but if they repent and amend they will not cease
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful
he does not accept the repentance of those who are penitent
allah accepts the repentance of his servants
indeed allah is knowing of all things
but when death approaches one of them he says now i repent now now now am quit of those who die now
for them we have prepared a painful punishment
o you who believe
it is not lawful for you to inherit women for what you have given them except that you may take a clear proof from them
if you do not enter the sacred mosque for them allah has certainly pleased you good for them
and if you desire to take away a wife in the wombs of another and you have not given them any sum of gold
will you take the precautions and manifest sin
how can you take it back when you have taken a covenant with one another and they have taken from you a solemn covenant
except those maidens of old after that
it is a promise of allah and an enemy and a way
forbidden unto you are your mothers your daughters your sisters your foster mothers and your foster sisters and your foster mothers and your brethren who foster sisters and your foster mothers and your foster mothers are not foster sisters and the daughters of your sisters and marrying the wives
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
except those women who are permitted to you except those captives and women
so that allah has given you
lawful to you are all these women for wedlock and not unlawful sexual intercourse with kindness
and when they have been honourably on their prescribed waiting then give them their due compensation
this is no sin for you in what your right hand possesses
indeed allah is knowing of all things
and whosoever of you is averse to his own hands and whosoever is in his heart
and allah is best aware of what you do
but those who are given their wealth and children are free from marriage
and if you marry the women who are guilty of adultery then if they have a debt for them
and for one who fears neither prodigal nor sin
but if you are patient then it is better for you
allah is forgiving merciful
allah wishes to forgive you and to turn you away from the ways of those who have gone before you
allah is aware of all things
allah wishes to forgive you and to become pleased with him
allah has promised you for your sake indeed he is a man of love
o you who believe
do not kill your own property except by your own selves
indeed allah is ever merciful to you
and whosoever hath done wrong and verily we have done it unto him
and keep your duty to allah and obey you and avoid evil sins which will enter paradise
and allah s bounty is over all things
for men is a share of what they earn
his good pleasure
allah is knower indulgent
and whosoever make a covenant with allah and his apostle and those with whom ye make a covenant with your tongues and your children
allah is witness over everything
and prefer one of them above others
the righteous are the obedient guarding
as for those who are idolaters and turn away from them in fear for them
if they obey you then do not obey them
indeed allah is allexalted allgreat
and if you fear between the jinns and the people of a woman who will stand before the wife of a noble messenger
but if they intend to do so god will enrich them
allah is knower aware
worship allah and ascribe no partner to him
and i find her right between you and the left and the right and the left and the left and the good and the traveler and the good
allah loveth the <unk> and the boastful
those who are greedy to be greedy and hide what god has cursed them
for the unbelievers we have prepared a humbling chastisement
and he would show men the way of life and the hereafter
how evil a companion he is the companion
have they not seen that allah and the last day and believe in allah and the last day and whatever allah has bestowed upon them
indeed allah is the allknower of the unseen and if he does not do good he will give himself a reward from his lord
how shall we raise up the witnesses when we have made you bear witness and how shall we be their witness
and those who disbelieve and they will not be able to hide the prophet on that day when they will be able to hide from allah
o you who believe
and you approach not the prayer while you are in a state of janabah except when you are sick or large
if you are sick or on a journey or you have a way of nature or a way of nature or you have reached retaliate from the privy of nature
indeed allah is allforgiving allmerciful
and those who have been given a portion of the book s lower and they have turned you away from the path of allah and they are in extreme error
but allah is best aware of your deeds
allah is sufficient as a guardian
and the people of the caravan are saying we have heard of their saying we have heard and we are not robbers
and if they had said we hear and obey and obey and listen to us they would say “ we hear and we have been better for us ”
but allah has made them hear nothing but little they believe
o people of the scripture
and cast thou into the dark and becometh like unto the dregs of the <unk>
and ever is the command of allah accomplished
indeed allah does not forgive that which he intends to fabricate
and he who ascribes partners to allah a falsehood has fabricated a lie against allah
no
allah purifieth whom he will and the palm trees and grapevines and the not a naqira speck on a datestone
look how lies against god
this is sufficient for the flagrant sin
and those who were given the book and say “ are these people for whom they are more truthful ”
they are like the ones who will not avail him at all
or do they have a share in the kingdom
that is how they will not give people a date palms
or do they envy people for what allah has sent down to them
we gave the book and the wisdom and the progeny of abraham a mighty lot
but when they went away from it they turned away as if they were averse
fire will be like fire
verily they disbelieve our revelations
so they will be admitted to destruction for their skins and we will replace them with other skins
verily allah is the rich
but those who believe and do good deeds will be admitted into gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding therein forever and we will admit them to shades with pure plenteous shade
indeed allah commands you to deliver trusts to the owners of the people who are entrusted to you and justice
how excellent is the exhortation of allah
allah is hearer seer
o you who believe
obey allah and obey the messenger and beware of yourselves if you obey allah and the last day
that is better and more favourable in the end
and ask you o muhammad saw who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you
and they have been commanded to cause them to follow nothing but satan desires to beguile them in full
and when it is said to them “ come down to what allah has revealed ” they shrink with their tongues and their hearts shrink away from you
then when their hands are tempted by him they say “ we have only intended only to bring out their good intentions to you ”
they are the ones whose hearts allah knows what is in their hearts
so admonish them and speak to them not when they speak to them
we sent to every prophet an apostle so that he may be obedient to him
and if they had wronged themselves they would have come to you and forgiveness from allah and the messenger muhammad saw and the messenger of allah and the messenger muhammad saw and the quran and the sunnah legal ways statements etc and those who disobey allah and his messenger
nay but they will not believe you until they have come to you with your lord and then they will not find within themselves any way with your hearts and they will not find within themselves any loss
if we had prescribed for them slay the guilty and the needy that would have been better for them they would have been better for them
we would bestow upon them a mighty wage
and we would have guided them to a straight path
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his messenger muhammad peace be upon him and hath been with them
how excellent a cradling
that is from allah allah is sufficient as a requital
o you who believe
and do not expel your property out of tied or go in haste
and among you there are some who when some of you there are some who turn away from him and say “ i have achieved a mercy from allah ”
if there had not been between you a happy thing between you he would have said would that i had never been with you
let them exchange the life of this world for the hereafter
and whosoever fighteth in the way of allah we shall bestow upon him a mighty wage
what is the matter with you that you spend in the way of allah and that “ our lord
make us a light from the village which we have been sent down from us and make us a light from yourself and make us a helper from us
and those who disbelieve in the way of allah and seek not the way of allah
so fight the stratagems of satan
indeed the plot of satan is weak
do you not see that it is said to them “ restrain your hands and to maintain the prayer and give the zakat and to the loan of allah ” they said “ o our lord
how well have you been taught us
say “ the time of the near ”
and the godfearing will be better for you and you will not be wronged even a thread inside the date palm trees and the hereafter will not be wronged
wheresoever you may be death will overtake you even though you be in fortresses
whenever an affliction befalls them they say ‘ this is from allah ’ but when an evil befalls them they say ‘ this is from allah ’
say all is from allah
what is with them that they may not understand it
and whatever good you do comes from your presence and whatever is evil befalls you
and we sent you as a witness and allah suffices as a witness
and whosoever obeyeth the messenger then verily we have not sent thee as a keeper over them
they say “ we will go away with you and some of them do not leave some others ”
allah is well aware of what they do
so turn away from them and put your trust in allah
and allah is sufficient as a reckoner
will they not then think
had it been from any other than allah they would have found in it much contradiction
and when there came unto them the treasures of peace they broadcast him and they were in the presence of their own oil and his substance
and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy you would have followed satan except a few
you are not responsible for yourself except for yourself
urge the needy and urge the equivalent of allah
and allah is greater in than more severe
and whosoever worketh righteously his soul shall be a goodly intercession and whosoever shall attach him to him in whose case he will be a righteous person
allah is the embracer the knower
when you are greeted with a greeting then greet with you with a mighty greeting
allah is ever ready to forgive all things
he will gather you on the day of resurrection
and who is more truthful than he who can be more truthful than allah
what was the matter with you that allah declares them in exchange for what they earned and allah is wroth with them
and you are not one who guides to the right way
and he who allah leaves astray you will never find a way for him
they are not like you they are disbelievers so do not approach them as they are faithless and do not befriend them
but if they turn away seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take no friend or helper
except those who are near relation with you or your hearts or your followers
had allah wished he would have given you power over them and they would have fought you
if they withdraw from you and do not fight you against them then allah does not allow you any way against you
you will find some people who wish to take advantage over you and their own selves
so they have departed from every shout
if they withdraw from you and find not their hands and fear them and kill them wherever you find them
we gave you clear signs
except for satan who can not help him
and whosoever slayeth a person is a believer he shall receive a wage from his right hand and let him not any harm
if he is a man who is with you is a believer then let him be your mother s family ’
if he is a <unk> between you and his family
and he who can not afford a ransom of allah for him is a fast of his own accord
allah is aware of all things
whoever kills a believer deliberately the recompense of his recompense is hell
allah has kept it upon him and his punishment with a great punishment
o you who believe
and when the hypocrites are in the way of allah he will say peace be upon you you will not be allowed to take care of their own souls
with allah are plenteous gains
thus did you give thanks
and that he it is who hath raised up for you
allah is aware of what you do
except the wife of the beloved of allah who does not leave the wealth of the battle of the battle and strives for their wealth
allah has preferred those who strive with their wealth and children
allah has preferred the best of rewards in their hearts and allah has preferred the best above them
this is a noble spirit from him and from him
allah is forgiving merciful
and the angels will say what is it you yourselves who did wrong
they will say we were in the earth
and the angels will say was not allah s earth wide enough for you to emigrate therein
these their refuge shall be hell and worst indeed is that destination
except those who do not charge any one of men and women and are not guided to the right way
maybe allah will pardon them
indeed allah is allforgiving allmerciful
and whosoever migrateth for allah will find refuge in the earth and his shelter will be for him and will create gardens of seventy times
allah is forgiving merciful
and when the land is no blame upon you in the land you do not blame upon you for what you cause corruption in the land
indeed the faithless are in manifest error
and when you come to pass and when you stand up for them and leave them with you to stand firm and let them find a group of them with you
and when they fall down upon them the group of the city they have prostrated themselves with you and they have prostrated themselves with you and their weapons and their hands with you
and the faithless may be restrained the hands of your hands and the pursuit of the enemy and they will be in neglect of makkah
if you do not commit it harm your heads or you are sick but if you are sick
indeed allah has prepared for the faithless a humiliating punishment
and remember allah standing sitting and on the sides
and do not shave your prayers for those who are free of you
lo the prayer is prescribed for the poor
and do not slacken in your homes
but if you are suffering so they are not suffering but you are hoping from allah
allah is aware of all things
we have revealed to you the book with the truth so judge between men
and that it is he who is among the symbols of allah
and ask forgiveness of allah
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful
and do not be of those who take your horses as a mockery
indeed allah does not like those who take away the enemy
they hide from the jinns
but they do not believe in the sight of allah while they are in the sight of their destruction
allah encompasses what they do
do you fear them for that worldly life
or who will have any intercessors against allah and so who will plead them for their sins
and whosoever does an evil deed and then he is forgiving and merciful
and whosoever earns a sin only himself
allah is aware of all things
and whosoever earns the qur an ’ and then he became a <unk> of his sin and he has fabricated it
and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy to you they would have mislead you but they have no power over them and they would have found themselves in error
allah has revealed to you the book and the wisdom and the book and the wisdom which you did not teach you
and ever is allah s grace ’ upon you
there is no good in much of their secret talks there is no good for the people who enjoins it to freewill offerings or to give you to honour
and whosoever desireth that we may spend in the way of allah we shall give him a mighty wage
and whosoever is led him after guidance and becomes shown him a way from the path of the prophet he will be thrown into it and evil is the destination
indeed allah does not forgive those who associate others with him
except that which is less than that
and he who associates others with allah has certainly been unfair
they worship instead of allah and do not follow the idols for the sake of satan
he said “ i will take for you a portion of the accursed ”
i will surely go astray and will go astray them
and whosoever takes satan as a patron instead of allah he has indeed suffered a manifest loss
satan has created them and so he increases them in nothing but satan s plan ’
these their refuge shall be hell and they will not find a way to go out
but those who believe and do good deeds we will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally
who is more deserving of allah than he who is more important to allah
that is the right way of your own desires nor the people of the book
whoever does evil will not be able to seek a reward for him nor will he be able to help him
and those who are burdened with their hands and their lord will be the garden of paradise and the date palm trees and the date stalk will not be wronged
and who is better in religion than he who submits his self to allah and follows the religion of ibrahim abraham hanifa islamic monotheism and he who was a muhsin old age
allah takes abraham for a friend
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
allah sets forth his knowledge of everything
they ask you for judgement
say o muhammad saw to them who were in the book and the orphans and the needy and the orphan and the orphans and the orphans and the wayfarer and the orphans the poor women who were not present with you to marry prescribed for you to marry the
and whatever good you do allah knows it
if a woman fears either of them or they turn away from him
better
and the foolish are <unk>
and if you are godfearing then know that allah is well aware of what you do
you will not be able to do so
one of you is one who rules and turns away from the other
and if you fear allah then know that allah is forgiving merciful
but if allah wills to enrich each of his plenty
allah has knowledge of all things
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and we instructed those who were given the scripture before you and you fear allah
and if you are in the heavens and the earth belongs to allah
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and allah is sufficient as a reckoner
if he wills he can do away with you and bring others
allah has power over all things
whosoever desires the reward of this world then with allah is the reward of the hereafter
and allah is allhearer allseer
o you who believe
and if they are patient or the needy or the captives or the relatives be a near relatives or the freeing of allah is more fitting
but if you are being lying and cognisant of your deeds then know that allah is well aware of what you do
o you who believe
believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and the quran which he has sent down before him
and whoever is wary of allah and the last day
indeed those who believe and then disbelieve after they have believed and then disbelieved after accepting the faith and then disbelieved after their belief
give good tidings to them o muhammad saw a painful punishment
and do not befriend them for those who choose them friends with their husbands and their friends
but to allah belongs all honour and glory
allah has sent down to you in the book that you do not sit with them by what allah has revealed and do not sit at them with a monstrous thing
or do you like them
indeed allah will gather the faithless and the faithless
they are waiting for you so if they gain a group from allah they will say were there not a victory against you the army of allah and if the disbelievers get you a victory near you they will say “ were we not strengthened you with the help
verily allah is the allhearer of invocations but he is deceiving them
and when they rise up to the people they call upon themselves and remember allah much
and they appoint to idols between them neither to the disbelievers nor to show any insolence
and he who sends astray for him you will never find a way
o you who believe
do not take the faithless for friends instead of allies
or is it a clear proof of allah that he has sent down to you
verily they will never be able to stir up the least you will find in the least a way
except those who repent and mend their ways and make them turn to allah with their religion
these are the <unk>
and allah will bestow on him a great reward
so that you may be grateful for the sake of allah and give thanks
and allah is ever allknower of everything
allah does not forbid the evil of good deeds except in the state of rebellion
allah is hearer knower
if you do some evil or conceal it then allah is able to do all things
and his work as he died and said “ we disbelieve in god and his angels ” and he says “ indeed in the cause of god ” and he was filled with a way between
these are the ones who will have a humiliating punishment
and he will give full of his forgiveness and grace and allah is the most merciful the forgiving
the people of the book ask you to bring down a book from the sky
they said “ show us nearer than this ”
so the thunderbolt seized them for their wickedness
then they turned away from their inner selves
so we gave moses the clear signs and we made it clear
and we made for them a covenant with their covenant saying “ enter the gate prostrating in the state of the fire ” and we said “ do not violate them with any gate for them ”
they were taking up in the signs of allah and their hearts at night and said “ no their hearts are uncircumcised ”
and they took a saying with their mouths and uttering a monstrous slander
and there were no fault in the prophet eisa the son of maryam said “ we were afraid of allah and undoubtedly the messiah eisa the son of maryam is not but a fact that they are the people of the noble messenger and they are not accountable for
nay allah raised him up to him
allah does not want to reduce the fruits of the prophet
there is no one of the people of the book before him and those who believe in him before his coming
we have made lawful to them for their wickedness and to bar them from the way of allah and from his way
and because their taking the people wrongfully and their devouring of the life of the world wrongfully and we have gotten ready for them a torment afflictive
but those who are wellgrounded in knowledge and those who have faith in what has been revealed to you and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat before you and believe in allah and the last day
we will give them a great reward
we revealed to you as we revealed to noah and the prophets as we revealed to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the progeny jonah
and that which has been promised to you o muhammad saw before and allah has knowledge of what came to you
and we sent to you good news and to the people after mankind
allah does not want to reduce the fruits of the prophet
it is a book that allah has sent down to you
and allah witnesses it
indeed those who disbelieve and bar others from the way of allah
and allah does not guide the harmdoers and the disbelievers
except those of you who are people to go astray from the path of hell
and that is easy for allah
o mankind
and the messenger of your lord has come to you
so believe in this is good for you
if you disbelieve to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
allah is aware of all things
o people of the scripture
do not act in your religion and do not say about allah except the truth
the messiah son of mary was only one of mary and his son and his mother said be not a word from allah
so believe in allah and his messenger and do not say three desist
that is a good thing for you
glory be to him
and allah is sufficient as a reckoner
the messiah is not a slave of allah nor are the close ones
whoever disdains his worship and is arrogant he will gather them all together
as for those who believe and do good deeds he will pay them their wages in full and will assign them their wages and will be a painful punishment for them
they will have no protector or helper
o mankind
now has there come to you a manifest proof from your lord and a light
and those who believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and do not touch them with the throne and he will guide them to a straight path
they ask you for judgement
say “ god provides you with indecencies ”
if he had a child he would have no child but if he had a sister of his inheritance
and if the two women are two sisters then their share of the two females or their husbands if they have two sisters then share the share of the two females
allah has made clear to you his law and he has strayed away from you
allah knows all things
o you who believe
and do not be accursed
forbidden unto you are the game of the cattle except that which is recited unto you
allah gives to whom he wills
o you who believe
the offerings of allah is mentioned and the cold of the kind of gifts that they are not exhausted or kind of halal unlawful sexual intercourse etc
and when you reach
do not let your enemies divert you from the enemy and do not expel you from the enemy of allah
and do not cooperate in sin and hostility
and fear allah
allah is the forgiver the most merciful
and the flesh of the swine and the <unk> mentioned in the name of allah and the beast of cattle that they are forbidden to be borne by strangling or by strangling or by paying off from one who eats of the cattle and the flock of a lesser
all that is transgression
so do not fear them today your religion is greater than me
this day you have made your religion for you and have made your religion as a way
whoever is wary of allah is forbidden to take away the self
and they ask you about what they are made lawful for them
say “ eat of the good things which allah has made lawful for you and good things which you have borne as well as lawful for you
and fear allah
indeed allah is swift at reckoning ’
it is the day of good things are permitted to you
the food of the people of the book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them
and those of you who possess the scripture before you and the idolaters and the maintenance of their mother s maintenance and those who gave you milk of the book before you
whoever disbelieves in the will have lost their faith and will be among the losers
o you who believe
and the prayer and the <unk> of the beloved of the fire and the <unk> and the <unk>
and keep your faces and your voice
if you are sick or on a journey or you have a journey or you have a way of nature or a way of nature or a woman or a way of nature or a journey
allah does not want to cause you to die but he intends to purify you and to complete his favor upon you that you may be grateful
when you said ‘ go down and remember allah s ’ ’ you will be told ‘ we will certainly abandon you ’
and fear allah
he knows what is in their hearts
o you who believe
allah does not allow to reduce any hatred from allah except by a large group of the holy war
and be just
it is nearer to piety
and fear allah
allah is aware of what you do
allah has indeed promised those who believe and do good deeds that they will have forgiveness and a great reward
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our signs
o you who believe
remember when allah s command ’ comes upon you he will give you their hands from you
so let them put their trust in god
we made a covenant with the children of israel
he said i am with you
if you establish prayer and give zakah i will surely admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and i will admit you to a straight path
then whosoever of you disbelieves after that he is led astray
and we made them a breach with the children of israel and made them hearing
they were filled with their intelligence so they were filled with good things
you will then learn a little while
and pardon them and overlook
indeed allah loves the doers of good
and said we are nazarenes and they forgot the saying we have received a solemn pledge
so a herald of them will be in vain and allah will inform them of what they used to fabricate
o people of the scripture
now hath there come unto you expounding unto you the knowledge of the book and the light hath come unto you and a manifest light
and allah sendeth down unto him out of peace by his command and guideth them by his leave and guideth them unto the path of darkness
they are indeed faithless who say ‘ allah has indeed disbelieved ’
say who could prevent the son of mary if allah had willed to destroy christ the son of mary and his mother and his son all together
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
allah creates whatever he wills
allah is able to do all things
the jews and the christians say we are sons of allah and his loved ones
say why does he punish you for your sins
nay you are mortals of his creating a man
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
o people of the scripture
now now hath come unto you expounding ye ceased not unto you lest ye should say the truth came unto us
now there has come to you a warner and a warner
allah is able to do all things
and when moses said to his people o my people
and remember allah s commands ’ upon you he sent you as a noble messenger
o my people
enter the holy land for you and be not held responsible for my relatives
they said o musa moses
in it are indeed a nation who will not enter it
then if they should go away from them we will follow
two women who were obedient to god and said “ enter the gate if you are expelled from it
and put your trust in allah if you are believers
they said o musa moses
they will never enter it till they are in it
and it is he who shows you and his angels and your lord s command ’
we will stay here
he said my lord
i have no control over my affair until you have power over us
he said “ in the land is forbidden to them for forty years
you are indeed a sinful people ”
and when they tasted of the truth they slew and inwardly started fearing that which is not accepted from them
the one said to his heir i will surely see you from me
he said “ god accepts only from the godfearing ”
i will not kill you for you to kill me
i fear allah the lord of the worlds
i am eager that you should be reared with my own desires and you become of the blind
that is the recompense of evildoers
then his brother became as he became godfearing and he became of the losers
allah sent down a book to be thrown in writing down the king s corpse ’
he said woe unto me
will i then be like this crow or bury my corpse ”
so we destroyed the sinners
so we delivered the children of israel from the sea as if they were a <unk> on the earth or a <unk> for him
and our messengers have already come to them in the earth many of them are transgressors
and strive against allah and his messenger and strive in the land and the abode of those who spread turmoil in the land and the land and the feet of those who earn mischief in the land and do not go out
that is a great humiliation in this world and in the hereafter they will have a great punishment
and that he may turn unto you repentant
o you who believe
fear allah and seek his way haply you will prosper
and if all that is in the earth were to create it and the like of it they would offer it to ransom themselves from the punishment of the day of resurrection it would offer it
for them is a painful punishment
the unbelievers would go out from it but they will not be driven out from it
for them is a lasting punishment
that is the recompense of the thief whether the penalty of the people or the thieves
allah does not want to reduce the fruits of the prophet
and whosoever repenteth after his belief and amendeth verily allah will relent toward him
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
do you not know that to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he punishes whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
allah is able to do all things
o you who have been able to keep your duty to allah
and when their hearts are tempted towards disbelief they say “ we believe ” and leave you to be disheartened by their hearts and to accept faith and to listen to you and from you and from those who are avid listeners to you
they say ‘ if you are truthful ’
but if you do not lend any excuse or you will not find for allah any cause of success
they are those whose hearts allah desired not to purify and in this world to come and in the hereafter is a great torment
they are listeners to falsehood devourers of unlawful earnings
and if they come to you judge between them or turn away from them
and if you turn away from them then they can not hurt you
and if they should judge between them with justice
allah is aware of all that is in the breasts
how can they have chosen you as a child when they have submitted you
but after that no one renounces this
they are the ones who will be destroyed
we have sent down the torah
for people who have faith in allah and his messenger muhammad saw have been sent down to islam — the true religion of islam are true believers
they witnessed the witness
so do not fear me
and do not exchange the small price for what allah has sent down they are the ones who are the ones who do not believe
we have provided for you with claws eyes and hearts abroad for a drawing near of hearts
whoever does that will pay the charity
and those who do not judge by what allah has revealed they are the wrongdoers
and we sent eisa the son of maryam after him we sent down the torah confirming the taurat torah before him and a guidance and a mercy for the godfearing
let them bear witness what allah has revealed
those who judge by what allah has revealed are the wrongdoers
we have revealed to you the book and the truth and it is they who have revealed
so judge between them by what allah has revealed to you and do not follow their desires so be not of the ignorant
we have appointed for every one of you and his law
had allah wished he would have made you one nation
but he made you agreeable in you
so he may good deeds
to him will be the chief of you all grief and he will inform you concerning what you used to fabricate
so judge thou between them by that which allah hath revealed and follow thou not the idolaters
but if they turn away then know that allah intends to afflict them for their sins
many of the people are wrongdoers
are they seeking the judgement of paganism
who is better than he who gives life to his own pattern
o you who believe
do not take the jews and the christians for allies
they are the allies of one another
and he who takes them for friends
allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
and you o muhammad saw ask the angels of the prophet muhammad saw saying we know that their number is true and we are with them a writing
perhaps allah will restrain his mercy from his presence and they will be regretful and they will be regretful
and those who believe will say by allah verily
they have lost their deeds and they are the losers
o you who believe
and whosoever of you is a renegade for him and he who is sick and who is a miser and whose striving is found in the way of allah and he who is a rich companion
that is the grace of allah which he bestows on whom he wills
allah is knower indulgent
allah alone is the knower of you and the prayer and the givers of zakah and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and zakat
and whosoever befriendeth allah and his messenger then verily allah and those who believe wherefore verily allah s party hath gotten ready for the party of allah
o you who believe
do not take your religion as your friends and do not take the unbelievers as friends with those who were given the scripture before you and those who take the unbelievers
and fear allah if you are true believers
and when you call to prayer they take it for mockery and fun of it
that is because they used to find a people who have no intelligence
say o people of the scripture
except what has been sent down to us and what was revealed to us and what was sent down before us and what was sent down to us
say shall i inform you of a worse position than that
this is the opinion of allah and those who have passed away their own selves and their offspring are they who are the ones who are the ones who are devoted to him
they are further astray and further astray from the way
and when they came to you they said we believe but they were in their hearts and they said we believe in what you have received
you will see many of them remorseful and their flesh
evil is what they used to do
why do not charge of sin nor forbidden for them
evil is what they used to do
the jews say allah s hand is tied
their hands are fettered and their feet
in both are two thirds of his service
surely we have sent down to you the book which is in your lord and many of them and unbelief and enmity and hatred between them until the day of resurrection
every time they ignite the fire of war allah extinguishes it
they were like cattle on the earth and allah does not like the traitors
if you had believed and were so pleased we would have punished them from the garden of bliss
and if they had observed the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and the quran from their lord they would have been taken from their places and their feet
and many of them there is a party who do not understand
o you who have been able to keep your duty to allah
and do not follow your lord s message ’ if you do not obey him
allah protects you from mankind
allah does not guide the disbelieving people
say o people of the scripture
what is the matter with your lord that you establish the torah and the gospel and what is revealed to you
surely many of them will be increased in rebellion and unfaith by what has been revealed to you from your lord
you are indeed a people who disbelieve
as for those who believe and do good works willingly or injury and have no fear of allah and his messenger muhammad saw and they are the best of good deeds
and we sent unto the children of israel and we sent unto them a messenger and unto them
whenever a messenger came to them they desired not a thing they desired to feel they called a lying sorcerer and a party of them they utter
they thought that they were blind so they became blind
then allah turned to them in forgiveness
then many of them continued and deaf
allah is seer of what they do
they are indeed faithless who say ‘ allah has indeed disbelieved ’
the messiah said o children of israel worship allah my lord
indeed allah has made a good example for him who has been bound to worship the earth and who has been arrogant in the land and the mountains
and they will have no saviors ”
they are unbelievers who say god has begotten a man
and he is not equal with allah
and if they do not desist from what they say a painful punishment will afflict those of them who disbelieve
they repent to allah and to him
allah is the forgiver the most merciful
the messiah son of mary was but a messenger before him
his mother was a nation of abraham
both will eat food
look how we paraphrase the signs to them so they are perverted
say “ what do you worship besides god what can neither benefit you nor harm you ”
allah is hearer knower
say o people of the scripture
do not exaggerate in your religion and do not follow other than the truth and follow the inclinations of the people who went astray and follow the way of the right way and follow the straight way
the children of israel and those who disbelieved among the tongue of dawud david and jesus son of mary
that was because they disobeyed and were wo nt to transgress
they will not forbid evil deeds from them
evil is what they have been doing
you see many of them taking the unbelievers for their allies
evil is what they have gained for them so that allah has cursed them and they will abide in it forever
and if they had believed in allah and the messenger and the believers they would not have taken it as friends
but most of them are transgressors
surely the most people are believers
and said verily we will ask the believers to be thou art the nearest of those who believe
for them is a rich between them and they will not ask
when they see that which allah has sent down to you you see their hearts looking on
they will say our lord
we have believed so we have been the ones who have submitted ourselves to us
why do we not believe in allah and in the least
we will admit us among the righteous
that is for what they have done in the gardens beneath which rivers flow where he will abide for ever
that is the reward of the doers of good
and those who disbelieve and deny our revelations
o you who believe
do not prohibit the good things which allah has made lawful for you and do not transgress
indeed allah does not like transgressors
eat of the lawful and good things allah has provided you and keep your duty to him
allah will not take you to task for your oaths but he will take you to task for what oaths he holds you to feed
that is the expiation of the people of the needy and the <unk> the <unk>
and swear by oath of your oaths
thus allah makes clear his ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc to you that you may be grateful
o you who believe
and verily the divining arrows are thereon and the divining arrows are abominations from shaitan satan s pollution
avoid them so that you may prosper
satan has certainly brought you enmity and hatred in the remembrance of allah and enmity and hatred you in ease and hatred and hatred
will you then desist
obey allah and obey the last day and be wary of him
but if you turn away then know that the messenger is only a manifest messenger
and those who believed and did good deeds and feared allah and then did not find any one to return to the believers after they had believed and were godfearing and then again many of them would not fear allah
and allah loves almuhsinun the gooddoers
o you who believe
allah knoweth that which ye have promised him in your hands and your feet may devour him in the unseen and he knoweth best who feareth him unseen
then whoever transgresses beyond that — a painful punishment
o you who believe
do not kill game while you are in the state of pilgrim sanctity
and whoever of you kills a healthy animal or a similar materials for the sake of the two of you is similar to the needy
or he who goes away from striving in the way of allah
and whosoever slayeth a sin from him allah is the rich the praised
and lawful for you are the pilgrimage and for you is the game of the land and for you is forbidden to hunt for you
and fear allah unto whom ye will be gathered
allah has made the sun the moon to the stars for a people and for the poor
that is because you may know that allah is in the heavens and the earth and that you know that allah is allknowing allknower
allah is the forgiver the most merciful
and the messenger of allah is only responsible for them
allah knows what you hide and he knows what you hide
say the good and the bad are not equal even though the abundance of your lord should be directed
so fear allah o you men of understanding that haply you may be successful
o you who believe
and when you look at the hearts of the people thereof is revealed unto you so beware of it
so that allah has pardoned you
and we created them before you of a people of old
allah does not pronounce the example of those who are <unk> against allah but it is the abomination of the devil to fabricate falsehood
but most of them are disbelievers
and when it is said to them “ come to what allah has sent down ” they say “ come to us ” and say “ come to us ”
if their fathers had been guided
o you who believe
rejoicing in their own contriving
but you are on the right way and whosoever erreth can not hurt you
to allah will you be questioned about what you used to do
o you who believe
when a group of you comes to a group of you in the two groups of death and when a group of you comes out of mutual agreement and if some death befalls you they are in the matter of your own persons
if you obey allah and his messenger they will not exchange the least harm and say we will be near to you for we would be of the sinful
and if it is not an enemy for each other and if the deceased has been guilty of two men of the cave they say “ we will be more unjust than two and we will not accept the testimony of our testimony ”
so that they may bear witness that their souls may be better than their own raising the fear of their oaths after their oaths
so fear allah and listen
allah does not guide the sinful people
he will say to his sons what is the matter with you
you are the knower of the unseen ”
allah said o mary how will you slaughter him in the cradle and in the prime of allah when he has delivered you from the cradle and in maturity and in maturity and you teach me a book and i am the foremost of the dead and you breathed
and when i inspired to the messenger saying believe in me and when they are inspired to me they say we believe
we are our witness so we are muslims
and when the son of mary said o son of mary
is your lord able to send down a table spread with us
he said “ fear allah if you are truthful ”
they said “ we are unwilling to eat from it and we think that you are truthful ”
jesus son of mary said o my mother
our lord send down upon us a table spread with food from heaven for the first and the last day
and provide for us you are the best of providers
he said “ i will make it a guarantor for you ”
but if he comes to any of you after that you have no one of you will ever overcome him
allah said o iesa jesus son of maryam mary
and did you say to the people “ worship me and my mother as two gods besides allah ” he said “ are you not to purify me ”
it was not for me to say what i had no right to say
and if you do not know it you would have been within the bellies of it
you know what is in my hearts
you are knower of the unseen
i am commanded to worship me but i am commanded to worship allah my lord and your lord
i was a witness over them and you are among them
you are witness over everything
if their punishment overtakes them they will surely have your right hand
and if you do not forgive them you are one of the ingrates
he said “ this is the garden of eden which rivers flow abiding eternally therein forever ”
allah is wellpleased with them and they are wellpleased with him
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them he is able to do all things
all praise is due to allah who created the heavens and the earth and has created the darkness
and those who disbelieve ascribe partners to their lord
it is he who created you from clay
there is a sign in him for him
yet you are still looking on
he is allah and the one deity in the heavens and the earth
and he knows what you hide and what you reveal he knows
no sign comes to them from their lord but they turned away from it
but when they came to them the truth they denied it
the ones whose women are to bring them what they have been doing
have they not seen how many a generation we have destroyed before them whom we had established you in the earth
we sent down upon them the rain of heaven and we caused them to inherit them other than they
had we sent down upon you a violent wind and they would have said this is nothing but obvious magic
they said why has he not sent down to him
and if we had not been to give them respite then they would not be reprieved
had we made it a thing they would have found it in a very strong way
they ask you o muhammad saw but the scoffers were mocked at the time of every time they were mocked at
say travel over the land and observe how was the fate of those who deny
say to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
say “ god alone has knowledge of it ”
allah will gather you on the day of resurrection in which there is no doubt
and the ruined and the disbelievers will not believe
and to him belongs the night and those who are in the darkness
he is the hearer the knower
say “ i am allah the one who created the heavens and the earth and he is the one who feeds ”
say “ i have been commanded to submit to allah ”
and that it is he who feeds and you are not of the idolaters
say “ i fear if i should be feared my lord ”
so whosoever has mercy on that day allah will have mercy on him
that is the manifest success
and if allah should cause you any harm to you he could have found none to remove it but he who is able to do all things
he is the subtle the aware
say “ who is more powerful than he ”
say allah is witness between me and you
this is revealed to me that i may warn you of it and that you may warn thereby
do you not testify that your god is one god
say i am not a witness over what they say
say it is from the lord of the heavens
i am innocent of what you associate
those to whom we gave the book recognise him as they recognize their sons
and the ruined and the disbelievers will not believe
who is more wicked than he who invents lies about god or denies his revelations
the wrongdoers will not prosper
on the day when we will gather them all together then we will say to the idolaters “ where are your partners ”
then they will say by allah we will leave our lord
see how they have been fabricating lies against themselves and how they were forging
and there are some of them who listen to you lest they should stumble in their ears and they say “ they are in their ears ” and they say “ we will not believe in it except the disbelievers ”
they hinder others from it and they themselves do not perceive it
he will say “ would that we had the present life
then we would be sent down to the words of our lord
nay but the messengers have been made manifest to them
and if they had been returned to what they could not have been able to do
they are liars
they said “ there is no more than a magic and we are the ones who will say ”
and i will draw them by the grip of their lord
will you then say ‘ is this not real ’
they will say “ yes by our lord ”
then it will be said taste the chastisement for that which ye used to deny
then the hour of the night will be presented as if they had neglected it will say alas for us we were laden with their own souls
evil is what they will
the life of this world is nothing but play and pastime
and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who fear allah
will you not understand
we know that you are saying but the harmdoers deny the signs of allah
their messengers came to them but they rejected the truth was not given them
none can change the words of allah
and the news of the messengers
and if they turn away then from the path of the heavens then strike the earth with their glances and then if it were not for them so would they be guided
“ and i am only a careful person who accepted from you ”
and he will resurrect them then to him they will return
and they say why is it that a man who has not been sent down to him from his lord
say allah is able to do all
but most of them do not know
on the earth are like beasts and many towering heads
will they then be held in the book
then to their lord they will be returned
and those who deny our signs are deaf and dumb in darkness
allah causes whomever he wills to a straight path
say “ tell me if the punishment of allah comes upon you ”
no you can know that he wills he could remove what he wills and he could remove what he had
we did not send before you and we caused them to go away from the past
why then when it comes upon them they are looking on
their hearts are like the devil s deeds which they had been working
so when they forgot the advices they were given to them they were rejoicing in what they were given we seized them suddenly and they were filled with dust
so we destroyed the people who were zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
praise be to allah the lord of the worlds
say have you thought if allah had to take away your gods and who would bring you out from allah
look how we explain the revelations but they turn away
say tell me if the punishment of allah comes upon you suddenly or you will not be destroyed except the wrongdoing people
and we do not give news except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner
and those who believe and do righteous deeds — they are the ones who will have no fear of their evil deeds
and they who belied our verses
say i do not say to you that i possess the treasuries of allah nor do i know the unseen
i am not a say of what is revealed to you
i only follow what is revealed to me
say are the blind equal are they equal
will you not reflect
and have passed away before your lord which they will find for them other than him a protector or an evil retreat that haply they may fear him
and drive away the prayer and those who call upon their lord morning and evening seeking his magnificence
and you will not be able to please them nor will they desire to be able to hurt you and you would be one of the wrongdoers
so we wished to be of them they said “ will we not follow anything other than a magic ”
allah is well aware of those who are grateful
and when those who believe in our revelations come unto you say peace be unto you
your lord has decreed it for himself who will forgive and then he will forgive him who repents after his sin
he is the forgiving the merciful
so we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc in detail
say “ i have been forbidden to worship other than allah ”
say i will not follow your desires for i should go astray and i should not be of the rightly guided
say “ i am a clear proof from my lord and you deny him ”
nor is it that you would have been earning
the decision rests with allah only
allah is the best of those who judge and judge
say if it were to come i would have been with me the matter would have been settled between you
and allah is the best knower of the zalimun wrongdoers etc
and with him are the keys of the ghaib unseen none knows them except he
land it is in the sea
and there is no sign except him who is the allknower of it
and not a thing of the earth nor is there a thing but that emerges from it in a manifest book
he is the knower of you who causeth you to grow
then he brought you back into the sea
then will we be made to him a new creation
so where are you being heading for what you used to do
he will surely take his hand over everything
when death comes to you from the angels who are entrusted to you until when you are visited by death comes to one of you
then they are the ones who know
the decision rests with him only he is the swiftest of reckoners
say who delivereth us from the sacred mosque and from that which we say to you if you are thankful
say “ god delivers you and what has been revealed to you ”
then you ascribe partners to him
say he is able to send you back from above you or from beneath your feet or to make you exceed the violence of one another
see how we explain the revelations so that they may understand
who is the truth of falsehood and who belied it
say i am not a guardian over you
for every season is a fixed time and you will know
and when they reach our revelations they fall down for them until they plunge into a blazing fire
and if shaitan satan should do not sit after the reminder after the reminder
the godfearing will not be nigh to their riches but allah will not be pleased
leave alone those who take their religion and play and leave forsake the life of this world
but man shall incur no benefit for what they have done
besides allah neither can any help be taken to him nor any intercessor be accepted from it
they are the people of what they used to earn
but those who disbelieve and taste a torment of scalding water and a painful punishment
say “ shall we worship besides allah that which can neither harm us nor benefit us in the earth after allah has guided us and then they say to us who has guided us to the right way ”
say “ it is only god s guidance and guidance to the lord of the universe ”
and to him you shall all be mustered
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in truth
on that day when he is told “ die ”
his word is the truth and the matter will be made to remain in it
he is the knower of the unseen and the seen the seen
when abraham said to azar azar takest thou idols
i see you and your people in obvious error ”
and thus we showed abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that we might know the convinced
when the night outspread over him he beheld him saying this is my lord
but when it set he said i am setting free from the setting of light
when he saw the moon rising he said ‘ this is my lord ’
but when it set he said “ my lord guides me i will surely be among the righteous ”
and when he saw the sun he said this is my lord this is bigger
and he said o my people
i am innocent of what you associate with him
i am the one who created the heavens and the earth and i am not of the idolaters
the <unk>
he said “ you are true to me ”
i am not a god other than him he please you
my lord comprehends everything in knowledge
will you not reflect
then you have no other ilah god s authority ’ upon you and i associate with him in his divinity
tell me what is more right that you can tell us if you are truthful ’
and those who disbelieve after themselves will be the guided ones and they will be the guided ones
these are the words we bestowed upon abraham against his own people
we raise in charge whomever we wish
indeed your lord is knowing of all things
and we bestowed upon him isaac and jacob and guided and we guided him to the way of his descendants dawud and sulaiman solomon ayub job and thus we reward the doers of good
and zachariah and john
all were among the righteous
and his wife and his kinsfolk
we have made all the prophets a noble messenger
and their fathers and their progeny and their progeny and their brethren and their offspring
that is allah s guidance he guides whom he wills
and if they had ascribed to him their deeds would have been vain
these are they whom we gave the book and wisdom and prophethood
and if they disbelieve in the verses of allah we will send them down to a people who disbelieve
these are the guidance of allah and you are guided by them
say “ whatever recompense of you i do not ask you for it
this is naught else than a reminder unto the worlds
they said “ god has sent down nothing to us ”
say who has sent down the book to moses and guidance and light for mankind which has been revealed to him
and he said “ and your forefathers of yore ”
say “ god has forgiven them ”
and this was a book which we have revealed to moses and a sanctuary that has passed away before it
and those who believe in the hereafter and they are the ones who are pleased with it
and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against allah or says “ who has been revealed to me ” and says “ who does not believe in allah and his messenger ”
and the wrongdoers are in their places stretching out their hands saying ‘ give up your souls
so now you shall be recompensed with a humiliating punishment for your unbelief and you shall be told of the truth
and to us alone we created you from the first time and from that we created you and you think that you do not believe in allah and in his partners
so ask you for what you assert
allah is the generous and the remembrance
he brings out the living from the dead
that is allah
so where are you being led away
the sun and moon for it he has disposed the night and the sun and moon for repose
such is allah s command ’
he it is who created the quran and his mercy that you may be guided
we have made plain the revelations for a people who know
it is he who created you and made you a single splendid abode
we have made plain the revelations for a people who know
we have sent down water from every palm trees and the datepalm and the pomegranate
and with hanging low within gardens of grapes and <unk>
and when it is recited to them that they stand in them and of their own lives are some who believe
they ascribe to allah as partners they used to associate others with allah
they have known their own desire and he has exalted for them and they assert
how could he have created the heavens and the earth
he has knowledge of everything
that is allah your lord
and he is allah your god the creator of all things
so worship him and he is the all things
vision can not encompass him but he penetrates all eyes
he is the subtle the aware
say “ who is blind proof has come to you from your lord so whoever is blind against himself and whoever goes away his own detriment
i am not a guardian over you
thus we explain the revelations for they will say you have studied and we have turned it into chaff
and follow that which is revealed to you from your lord there is no deity except him and turn away from the polytheists
had allah willed they would not have ascribed partners to him
we have not appointed you as a trustee over them and you are not a manager over them
and do not follow the idols for they have taken away from allah as a plot
thus we have made their conduct seem decorous to every kind of sin
then their lord will inform them of what they used to do
and those who disbelieve will enter the name of allah with their sign if a sign came to them they would believe in it
say “ you are only being deluded ”
we turn them away from the first time and leave them to turn away from the first way
and had we sent down angels to them and the dead had spoken to them and they would not have believed unless allah had willed they would have guided
but most of them do not know
and thus we have appointed for every prophet an apostle a prophet and a light for mankind so that they may be set in a fixed number of the night
and if your lord willed they would not have done so leave them with their misdeeds
that is because they may believe in the hereafter that it may be that some of it may touch them and that they may be pleased with certainty
say is it possible for me to bring you the book from allah when it is recited to you
the book was sent down to you by your lord
and that is the one of those who doubt
and for your lord s houses and the balance
none can change his words
he is the hearer the beholder
if you obey the majority of those who live on earth they will lead you astray from the path of allah
they follow nothing but conjectures and they do not know
your lord is best aware of him who strayeth from his way and he is the best knower of him who strayeth from his way
if you disbelieve in the name of allah then eat of the flesh of his name
why should he not pronounce for you until the name of allah is mentioned for him when he has prescribed for you what is the name of his long
indeed many astray are astray by their own desires
your lord is best aware of those who exceed the bounds
forsake the outward sin and inward
indeed those who commit sin will be requited for what they used to do
do not eat from the name of allah indeed this is an evil thing for the sin of ignorance
the devils inspire their friends to dispute with you
if you obey them you will be idolaters
is he who has given life and has given him a light and whose hearts we have not created for him from the land
so they will be in the past
and thus we have placed in every city a pathway which is wrong
but they do not know it is they who are the ones who are themselves the losers
and when a calamity came to them they said “ do not believe ”
and allah knows best what is in your hearts
the guilty will be repaid for what they used to do
he sendeth down as if he willeth for him he putteth his breast
thus is allah s promise ’
that is the straight way of your lord
we have made plain the revelations for people who reflect
the abode of peace is upon their lord
he is the best of what they used to do
and on the day when he will resurrect all together he will say to his people “ o my people
you will then follow a falsehood of jinn and you will certainly be divided
and among them will say “ our lord
we are waiting for us ”
he will say ‘ are you trying to be your abode
abiding eternally therein
your lord is the knower of the human
so we shall exchange for what they have earned
he said “ o company of jinn and humans
does there not come to you from among you relating to you my verses and warning you of the messengers ”
they will say we testify bear witness against ourselves
they were unbelievers against the worldly life and the last of the unbelievers
that is because your lord does not destroy the cities
for every person is a recompense for what he has earned
and your lord is not unaware of what they do
and your lord is the owner of mercy
if he wills he can remove you and bring you back into nations after you he will of the people he raised you from the descendants of others
indeed you are now suffering and you will be seized by the punishment
say o my people
act according to your power
i too am acting
and you will come to know who will be overtaken by the disgrace of the hereafter
the wrongdoers will not prosper
they have made for him a share of the life of the world and the tillage of allah and he says this is for their false gods
and we have put for him a share in the way of allah and he has not straitened for him
evil is what they judge
so that they may ruin them in their wealth and their lives to ruin them
had allah wished they would not have done it
so leave them alone with their fabrications
they will say “ this is for their own roasting
and they are those mentioned in the name of allah
they ascribe to allah their due share in the night and they have made it a lie
he will drive them back to their going to be crushed
they say “ what is in their bellies in the wombs of these cattle is for our wives and if it be born ”
allah will requite them for their sins
he is indeed the knower of things
do not fabricate lies to allah s name ’ and who have lost their ascribing partners to him in ignorance and are the losers
they have gone astray and are guided
and he is who has power over his service and the palm trees and the olive and the pomegranate like of the palm trees and the pomegranate
eat of their fruits when they are prodigal and do not eat up the flesh of their extravagance
indeed allah does not like the wasteful
he created the human being and the <unk>
eat of the lawful and good things allah has provided you and do not follow in satan s footsteps ’ he is your open enemy
he created eight couples and children and he built and <unk>
say is it the two males or the two females or what the two females contain
tell me the truthful will be true
and the needy and the beloved shining
say is it the two males he has forbidden you or what is it that allah has forbidden you
who is more wicked than he who invents a lie about allah
allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
say “ i find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be forbidden to me except carrion or blood which the flesh of swine and the flesh of swine what has been slaughtered from allah ”
whosoever does an offense to eat of it and transgress incurs him verily allah is forgiving merciful
to those who are jews we forbade every animal with claws
and with the <unk> of the sheep and the goats we forbade them their fat except the fat of the oxen and the entrails or their backs
that is because we have given them from that which we have earned
we are the truthful
if they deny you say “ your lord is dispenser of mercy but your lord is not one of the sinners ”
and the idolaters will say “ had allah willed we ascribed no partners to him ”
likewise did those before them deny so they tasted our wrath and for you are the losers
say “ what is there a scorching wind ”
you follow nothing but conjectures and you do nothing but guess ”
say “ if only god had willed he would have guided you all ”
say bring your witnesses to testify that allah has forbidden this
and if they testify to their own hands and testify against them
and those who do not believe in the hereafter and equate others with their lord
say come i will recite what your lord has forbidden you and do not abandon anyone with him and abandon your wife at all
and you will not eat of them nor will we feed for your own lives
do not kill your children that allah has forbidden you in order that you may exercise your reason
do not approach the sum of their belongings and do not approach except in a state of sexual relation with it
and do you give the measure and the balance
we charge not a soul save with its capacity
when you speak be fair even if it is true
he has instructed you that you may remember
that is my straight path so follow it and do not follow other ways lest they become guided
verily he hath led you astray from the path of allah
that he has enjoined upon you so that you may refrain from evil
then we gave moses the good things and made it a way to be one who follows his lust and who are guided to the right way that they may be guided
this is a blessed book which we have sent down
so follow it and fear allah that you may receive mercy
and we revealed it to be said “ you have found our forefathers preceding it ”
or lest you say if only the book had been guided us we would have been better guided than they
so whoever has now come to you from your lord a clear proof and a guidance and a mercy from them
we will punish those who turn away from our signs with a painful punishment because of their turning away
or are they waiting for the angels to come down or that your lord should come or that they come down
the day when its lord s signs ’ comes ’ from him ’ or believes in the oneness of allah
say wait we too are waiting
and their religion is not for them to ascribe partners to allah
then allah will inform them of what they used to do
and whosoever worketh righteously shall be requited for him and whosoever bringeth an evil deed shall be recompensed only for him and he shall not be wronged
say my lord has guided me and he was not one of the idolaters
say my life and my life and my death are all living and my dying
no associate has he
and i am commanded and i am one of those who surrender muslims
say “ i am god s lord ’ ”
no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another s burden ’
then will your lord be destroyed and will inform you of what they used to differ
he it is who hath made you caliphs in the earth
your lord is swift in retribution
he is the forgiving the merciful
alif lam
<unk>
aliflaammeem
sad
this is a book sent down to you so do you not be warned
follow what is revealed to you from your lord and do not follow other than him
how little is it that you reflect
how many a village we destroyed
our punishment came to them at night when they were sleeping at night
and when our terror came upon them they said we were only a people who have been zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and we will surely question the believers who are the messengers and the best of helpers
we did not have been prevented from their deeds
the scales on that day is certain
and he whose scales are heavy they are the successful
and he whose scales are light so they will be losers
and we have placed you in the earth and appointed for you therein provisions
how little are they admonished
then we made you proper then we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam and then we said to the angels prostrate yourselves
they prostrated except iblis he was not one of those who prostrated
he said what prevented you from prostrating when i commanded you to prostrate
he said i am better than he
you created me from fire and you created him from clay
he said “ deliver all this from us ”
now show thou the way
go away from my exit indeed you are one of the debased
he said respite me till the day they are raised up
he said “ you are indeed among the reprieved ”
he said “ i have led me astray and i will surely guide me on the straight path ”
then they will come before them and from their right and from their left and from their left and from their right hands and from their left and you will not find most of them thankful
he said begone
and whoever follows you of them follows you
and adam
but eat of the sexual intercourse with your own eyes and do not approach them except you will be among the wrongdoers
satan whispered to them their father saying what we have not made them except that your lord has made clear to you that you should be your mother s exclusive enemy ’
and he said “ i am indeed your lord ”
so he threw them down
so they both became exposed to their nakedness and they began to stitch over themselves with their shame and their shame came upon them
then their lord called out to them “ i have declared you to be an open enemy ”
they said our lord
we have wronged ourselves
if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us we will be among the losers
he said go down one of you enemies
on earth is a fixed time for you
he said you shall live there and you shall live and therefrom you shall die
children of adam
we have sent down to you your nakedness and feathers and piety is better for you
that is the grace of allah that haply ye may remember
children of adam
satan made you to go out to the enemy of satan as he brought you out of the hidden
he and his tribe will see you away from where you can not see them
we have made the devils friends of those who believe
and they say “ god commands us to do what they did ”
say “ god commands what you do not command ”
or do you say that you have a thing against allah
say my lord commands justice
and prostrate yourselves to him and pray and pray to him while you are devoted
it is he who created you the first time
allah has written for his servants and they have adopted the way of allah as a friend and they have departed from him
children of adam
and eat and drink and waste not
indeed allah does not like the wasteful
say who will eat of the sustenance of allah and the sustenance he has forbidden out of his mercy
say these are the wares of the life of this world
thus do we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for people who reflect
say “ my lord has revealed to himself and his establishment and that he has not revealed anything to what he has revealed ”
for every nation there is a single time when they will not delay it nor will they advance it
children of adam
there is no welcome for you from me that you have from me and he will render their deeds go on them
but the false deities will be roasted in the fire they will abide therein eternally
who is more wicked than he who invents lies about god or denies his revelations
their souls will come out to them rushing “ where are they who will be told “ where are you used to get away ”
they will say “ they have abandoned us and they testify against themselves ”
allah will say “ go into the jinn and the jinn and the people of jinn ”
every nation went forth one of them until when their fate will be said ‘ our lord
these are they whom you led us away and leave us to be a portion of the fire
he will say “ you do not know ”
then the first will say to their deeds “ taste of us is the suffering ”
verily the weight of the heavens and the earth shall be <unk> for them and the gates of the eye
thus do we requite the sinful people
their trade will be the fire and they will be in the fire
thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
but those who believe and do good deeds they shall be the inhabitants of paradise they shall abide therein eternally
we charge not any soul save with its capacity
we shall bring out their hearts
beneath them will flow beneath them
and they will say “ praise be to god who has set us back ”
had allah not guided us we would have been guided
indeed our lord s messengers ’ brought the truth ’
it will be said “ this is the paradise of your inheritance ”
the inhabitants of paradise will say we were not guided
you have indeed found your lord to be a man of guiding you
they will say yes
and when they are told ‘ do not exceed the bounds of allah ’
those who hinder others from the way of allah and are lost in the hereafter
and between each of them is a veil and its keepers will say peace be upon you
while they are in the garden of which they will be brought
then their faces will be said o lord relieve us of the evildoers
and the dwellers of the elevations will say “ not your foot nor will they get out of their destruction ”
allah said “ yes by the words ”
depart and told “ enter the garden of hell
you have no fear nor any fear
they will say “ we have covered you with a water flowing by which allah has provided you ”
they will say “ god has forbidden these ”
who took their religion and play and whom the life of this world deceived them
so today we shall ignore them as they forgot the meeting of this day and they were <unk> denying our signs
we have sent down the revelations for them and a guidance and mercy for people who believe
or do they await anything but a guess
and the day when it had come before forgetful the heat of our lord had written it
are we to intercede for us some who would have been ruined
or do you think that we may be before ”
they will be lost in their ruined and what they used to fabricate will disappear from them
indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days then he is one of the allglorious
he it is who subjected the night and the day and he is the sun and the moon
and his are the creation and the command
and allah is the lord of the worlds
pray to your lord with humility and also
he is indeed transgressors
and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed
indeed the mercy of allah is near to the doers of good
it is he who sends the winds as harbingers of his mercy and we drive it down and we drive away the clouds and bring forth thereby fruits of every kind
thus we repay the dead
haply ye may remember
and they will be brought forth from the <unk> of their lord
thus do we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc for a people who give thanks
and we sent noah to his people and he said o my people
worship allah
you have no other god besides him
i fear the punishment of a great day for you ”
they said we see you and indeed we see you are in manifest error
he said o my people
i am not a fool in my presence but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
i convey unto you the messages of my lord and i am the messenger of allah that which ye do not know
so that i may warn you of a reminder from your lord that you may warn a people of advice
but those who denied him so we saved him and those with him in the ship and we made it a lesson for those who were with him
and we drowned those who denied our signs and they were the people of the pit
and to ad we sent their brother hud
he said o my people
worship allah
you have no other god besides him
will you not then be wary of him ’
they said “ we see you and your offspring are indeed liars ”
he said o my people
i am not a fool from the lord of the worlds
i am not a clear proof to you from my lord
or do you wonder that a reminder from your lord should come to you
and remember when he made you successors after the people of nuh noah and increased you in stature
remember allah s command ’ that you may prosper
they said “ do you worship me and do not worship allah ”
then bring upon us the chastisement that you threaten us with if you are truthful
he said “ i have already punished you from your lord and he was a great punishment ”
do you dispute with me concerning names which you have named you and your fathers
so wait
i am with you a watcher
so we delivered him and those with him by our mercy and we made them leaders and they were not believers
and to thamud we sent their brother salih
worship allah
you have no other god besides him
clear proofs has come to you from your lord
and allah has made the means of your deeds a sign for you
do not let her pasture on the earth and do her harm her lest a painful punishment should seize you
remember when he made you successors after ad and increased you in the earth
and you are mountains in the mountains
and remember the name of allah much corruption in the land
his lord has been gracious to his companion they said “ you are really ruined ”
they said “ we are in truth ”
they said “ we disbelieve in your hearts ”
and they went on contending of the commandment of their lord and said o salih
if you are one of the messengers they will surely have brought us a painful punishment
and the earthquake seized them so they became within their homes
so he turned away from them and said o my people
i have been given to you the messages of my lord and you do not want wellwishers ”
and remember
when he said to his people “ do you have no different ways before you
what you approach men lustfully instead of women
you are a people who exceed the limits ”
and his wife was saying drive them away from your township they are only being driven away from the city
and we saved him and his family except his wife she was one of those who remained behind
we poured down upon them a rain of stones
so see what sort of fate befell the guilty
and to midian we sent their brother shu aib
he said o my people
worship allah
you have no other god besides him
and give you a clear proof from your lord and do not corrupt the land and do not corrupt the earth after it has been set in it
that is better for you if you only knew
and do not sit down on every road of war lays down from the path of allah and his messenger muhammad saw
and remember how he made you appear as few
so observe how was the fate of the agents of corruption
if you are patient and do not help us with me then god is one of us
he is the best of judges
his people said “ we will surely believe in you and we will surely expel you from our town or we will surely believe with you ”
he said “ go into bits ”
allah saved us from disbelief after we will then be fabricating against him
our lord is not a thing of us
our lord comprehendeth everything in his knowledge
in allah we have put trust
our lord
our lord decide between us and our people for you are the best of deciders
he said “ you will surely follow the losers ”
and the earthquake seized them so they became within their homes
as if they had never lived there
they were the losers
and he turned away from them and said o my people
i am not a wellwisher to you from my lord and i am your wellwisher
we did not send a messenger to a town that they could not have suffered hardship
then we changed the evil in their state until they grew <unk> and said “ our ancestors used to turn away ”
and we will not have them in any way they will have protected it
had he been on the townships we would have opened upon them from the heaven and the earth
but they denied the messengers so we seized them with punishment for their deeds
did they not consider the people of the garden while they were sleeping
so the people of the town they were also the townships of their dwellings they were also the very well pleased
or are they the ones who are the ones who buy themselves
they will not be the losers
is it not we who inherited the earth after the previous generations we will destroy them and their sins and we will surely bring them forth for them a new creation
that is their news which will reach you
and indeed their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they were not believers
thus allah maketh the hearts of the disbelievers
and their hearts came to pass by
and they were <unk> of what they used to do
then we sent moses after them and they remained in their transgression
so see what sort of fate befell the mischiefmakers
he said o my people
i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
my plan is only for allah
i have come to you with clear signs from your lord
so allow me to go with me ’
he said “ then if you are truthful ”
so he threw down his staff and lo it was a serpent manifest
and he turned out of the heaven and the morning he became a <unk>
he said “ this is indeed a skilled magician ”
who seeks to expel you from your land
what is the steep
they said put him and his brother off for a while and send forth heralds to the cities
and we come to you with your gaze
and the magicians came to him they said “ shall you be a reward for us if we are the victors ”
he said yes you will be among those brought near to me
they said o musa moses
either you throw first or we will be the first to be the first of them
he said “ you were before ”
so they cast terror into the breasts of the people and cast terror into the breasts of the mighty magic
and we inspired moses saying throw your staff
so the truth came upon their false inventions
so the truth came to pass and what they used to fabricate has forsaken them
so they turned back and turned away
the magicians fell down in prostration
they said “ o dear prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him “ o people ”
moses and harun aaron
he said “ you have accepted faith in him before i gave you permission
verily it is a device that ye will be in the city
then you will know
and he who goes out to light and then left you into the bellies of your constant three days
they said “ indeed we are to our lord
you were only to believe in the lord s ’ lord when they came to us
our lord
and give us steadfastness and make us die as muslims
they said “ you will not cause it to go away and we will spread you away from it ”
he said “ we will give them their share of the right hand and their wealth will be of the feast ”
moses said to his people seek help in god and be dutiful
lo
he createth what he will
the sequel is for the cautious
they said we were not before you nor were you suffered to us
he said perhaps your lord will destroy you in the land after he has made you successors on the earth
and we have kept fruit and fruits that they may remember
whenever misfortune befalls them they say “ it is only a good deed ” and when misfortune befalls them they said “ o moosa
allah has the power of their own desires but most of them do not know
and they say “ we will not be able to do so ”
and we sent down upon them a garment for you
they were a people who were mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals disbelievers sinners etc
they said o musa moses
and make a covenant from your lord
if we will we will believe in you and will surely believe in you
so we defer their term till a predetermined time
so we seized them with misery and we drowned them in the sea
and moses was also a successor and we blessed him and the land which we had blessed
we had made the children of israel with their lord and we had made the children of israel with gold and we were best in it
and we brought the children of israel across the sea and they came to a people who were devoted to their people
they said o musa moses
we shall make for them a just like us
he said you are a people behaving ignorantly
verily the evil deeds that they have been doing is in the past
he said i am for you a god other than god he has preferred you over the worlds
and we saved you from your family and they were asleep
in that was a tremendous trial from your lord
and we made moses the course for him and made the night and the day
he said “ make me go astray and do not go away from the way of the authors ”
so when he came to him he said my lord
show me the way i turn to you ”
he said “ see me see you are not able to see me
if he had so willed he would have said to his place then you will see me
so his lord called him to dust and crushed him with a complete devotion
and moses threw down the water
so he said “ glory be to you
and i am the first of you and i am the faithful
he said o musa moses
i have preferred you over the worlds
so be grateful to you and be among the thankful
and we said unto him travel in all kinds of all things and knowledge and thy way and thy people and say take the best course
i will show you the habitation of the ungodly
and they will not cease on earth as much as they will be able to deprive them of the signs
they are the ones who bar from the path of the path of allah and they will not adopt it as a way for them and they will adopt it as a way
and those who denied our revelations and the meeting of the hereafter
will they not then reflect upon what they used to do
and the people of moses adopted a calf for a calf
did they not find it guiding them
so the man took to himself
and if they see their hands who have lost themselves and they will say our lord if they have not mercy on us and forgive us and have not mercy on us we shall be among the losers
and moses returned to his people angry and disappointed he said ‘ what do you go away from me
“ so that you may lose heart ”
and he drew out his anger and his brother
he said o my son
indeed my wife used to understand me
make me a shameful enemies and do not make me one of the wrongdoers
he said my lord
forgive me and my brother and admit us into your mercy and show us the way of those who show mercy
indeed the covenant of your lord will be taken away from their backs and grief
thus do we recompense the criminal
but he who repents after that he is the forgiving the most merciful
and the tablets of moses was he who took away the tablets and mercy from his lord
and moses said to his family “ my lord
had you willed you could destroy us before this we would have destroyed them and have destroyed them with your mercy on us that they are of you
you are not a tyrant to guide whomever he wills
you are our guardian
our lord forgive us and have mercy on us you are the best of those who show mercy
we are the best of fortune for you and we are the ones who turn away
he said “ i am exhausted by my hands
i fear allah and amend and give him of his revelations and he who believe in our revelations
who when they are in disagreement about their hearts
it is the good deeds that their hands forbid them from the good things which is bad and their foul state made lawful to them and their foul things which they have earned and their foul deeds appeared to them
and he who believed in him and his messenger and is followed him with him and whose hearts are satisfied with him and those who win him with him are the successful
say o mankind
i am allah s messenger of the heavens and the earth
he gives life and causes death
so believe in allah and his messenger and his messenger and the messenger muhammad saw and the messenger muhammad saw and his sunnah legal ways orders etc and say to allah that you may be guided
and there is a sign in moses and his people with truth that he may judge between right and justly
and we sent them to be the two days of the two days and we inspired in him saying strike the rock with moses
and there gushed forth from it twelve springs of each other s people ’
we sent down upon them manna and quails saying eat of the clean things we have provided you with clean things we have provided for you
they wronged us not but themselves they wronged
and when our lord said to them “ pray for your statues ” and eat from it and do not approach us in the gate prostrating in the way of allah and do good deeds we will forgive your sins and do good deeds
and those who wronged them will be admitted to destruction from the heaven so we sent down upon them a plague from the sky because of their wrongdoing
and when they came to them with the sabbath their lives and they were not to come to them
so we requited them for their sin
and when a party of them said “ why do you destroy a people for a painful punishment ” they said “ may be upon your lord so that they may be wary of him ”
so when they forgot what they used to do we saved them from a terrible punishment because of what they used to conspire
and when we opened their gates they said to them ‘ be pure ’
and recall what time thy lord would impose on them a day of doom
indeed he is the allclement the allmerciful
we made them the earth as a <unk>
some of them will be righteous and some of you will be otherwise
and we will give them good tidings and that haply they may return
then after them shall be among the posterity
they said this is an enjoyment of the present life
they will neither return to them nor turn it into effect
is not allah s covenant reached up that he has taken away from them a covenant with him
they have studied what is in the book
and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who ward off evil
will you not understand
and we have inspired the book and the upright and we shall reward the righteous
and when we have made the mountains a covering of <unk> as if it were a canopy and they thought that we would keep firm them in their mind saying do what we have given you
when your lord had given a seed of their seed he said i am your lord
they said yes we are the ones who will say
that is because ye were wo nt to know
or lest they should say we were our fathers before us
will you destroy us for what they have done
thus do we explain the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc so that they may return
that is the story of the mount which we had recited to them and he became of the people who are lost
we have measured it for a while
but he <unk> his life and the wind and the caravan he had <unk> him and he sought his whispering
and those who denied our signs
so that they may be reminded
evil is the likeness of the people who deny our signs
he is the guidance and he who comes with guidance and it is they who are the losers
and we have appointed for mankind hell and with him we have appointed for men ears and eyes therewith and they hear not
these are they even more astray
these are the heedless
to allah belong the best names
so call upon him with the authority so call upon him and dispute about his names
they will be requited for what they used to do
and of those we have created there is a nation who guide and follow the right path
and those who cry lies to our signs and they perceive from the place of sleep
i will soon give them respite
my task is indeed in my belly
will they not then walk upon their faces
he is naught but a warner and a warner
have they not seen that allah s is the creation of the heavens and the earth
then after which will they believe
allah guideth unto him a way
allah will make them enter their transgression
they ask you about the hour
say “ this is only from my lord
and he who revealeth the qur an
heavy upon the sea and the burden of the burden
he will come to you suddenly when you are unaware
as if they were unwilling
say thou this is the message but most people do not know
say “ i have no power over benefit or benefit myself except as god wills
and if i had the unseen i would have acquired much good
i am a warner and a bearer of glad tidings to a people who believe
it is he who created you from a single soul and he it is who has created you from it
and when he had <unk> his wife she had heavy she had been charged with a household of fire and she was bearing their lord if it were a child then we would not be of the thankful
he has given them a son so they ascribe to him
high is allah above all that they associate
they do not ascribe any partners to allah
can they help them nor help themselves
you will call them to guidance
and he has subjected them to you and he has subjected them to you
and they are like you who have taken away their hands and they are more afraid of allah
call them to the truth if you are truthful
or do they have a conspiracy that they have feet or have feet so devise their feet or have they feet against me say ‘ do i give me respite ’
lo my lord is allah who revealeth unto me
he <unk>
and do not help you nor can they help you against the help of allah
and you will see them when they hear the guidance and they will not hear it
adopt forgiveness enjoin what is right and turn away from the ignorant
and if a provocation from satan should provoke you seek refuge in allah
he is the hearer the knower
when the devil reaches him they thought a plot and statues
and the devils pull out from their homes
and when you see them they say why do you not say it is
say i follow only what is revealed to me from my lord
these are insights from your lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe
and when you are recited to the qur an ’ and so that you may receive mercy
and remember your lord within your hearts and your heart beseechingly and fear not and be of the neglectful
and the angels who are not prevented from the command of their lord prostrate and do not prostrate
say “ the spoils are lawful and the messenger ”
so fear allah and obey the messenger and beware of it if you are believers
and when the hearts are recited to him they do not believe in the signs of their lord they put their trust
and perform assalat iqamatassalat and spend of that we have provided them
they are the truthful
they will have degrees with their lord and provision for them
and your lord does not make you a <unk> for the traitors even if it had died you would have sworn for them
and they were about to dispute with you concerning it even as though they were disputing
and when allah promised you he will replace you with one another
but god attains his words to uproot the truth
that he may confirm the truth and falsehood even though the guilty should be averse
when you are asked help from your lord he answered i will help you
so he made it glad tidings and he has made it proper
victory comes only from allah
verily allah is the rich
and recall what time allah sent down unto you water from him abundant water and from the sky that he may bring you out of the mercy of the devil and that he may remove from you
and recall what time thy lord said unto the angels verily i am with you
and those who believe in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and fear allah and avoid all kinds of good deeds and evil deeds which he has ordained and <unk>
i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve
so strike them with necks and the pagan arabs
that is because they opposed allah and his messenger
and whosoever opposeth allah and his messenger he will punish them with a painful punishment
so taste it and taste the punishment of burning
o you who believe
so give the faithless to them
and those who have taken refuge in a place of shelter and whosoever shall have a refuge besides allah and their refuge shall be hell an evil destination
you do not think them allah has pardoned them
and you did not see the people when he threw some good or restricts it
allah is hearer knower
so look at the unbelievers
if you do not judge then you will be able to receive the truth
if you do not desist we will extend your pleasures and if we extend you hostilities
we will surely create you even if you are able to avail you against god
o you who believe
so turn away from him and do not obey him
do not be like those who say ‘ we hear ’
indeed the worst of creatures are the deaf and dumb
if allah had so willed he would have made them hear or look at them
o you who believe
and when he calls you to what allah has opened for you and his messenger he has drawn upon you in the company of his heart and his heart
so beware of a people who will not harm you and know that allah is the one who will punish the wrongdoers
and remember when you were few and when you were few in the land he gave you refuge in the land and strengthened you with his mercy and give you victory over you so that haply ye may give thanks
o you who believe
and do not take god and his messenger and do not knowingly betray your own
and know that your wealth is with allah is a mighty wage
o you who believe
if you fear god he will give you a protection from him and forgive you
allah is the possessor of immense grace
and when they plotted you kill you they plotted against you a plot and allah is the best of devisers
when our verses are recited to them they say ‘ we hear
so we have made it a <unk>
this is nothing but a habit of great sin ”
when they said ‘ o allah
if this comes from you a rain from the sky or bring down upon us stones from the sky rain
and you will never punish them while they are hypocrites when allah is pleased with them
so they were not able to hasten it nor did allah punish them
his wife shall be only meant
but most of them do not know
and their houses is a house in the sacred house
taste you the punishment because of your disbelief
verily those who disbelieve spend their wealth and hinder from the way of allah
then we will make it orchards and then again it will be more difficult for them
and those who disbelieve will be cast into hell
allah will make the loads of the people who take away their hands and cast them into the fire
they are the losers
say if the unbelievers desist then the consequence of their disbelief will be destroyed if they had gone before the former generations
and fight against allah until there is no more fitnah and religion
if you do not desist god is cognisant of what they do
but if they turn away know that allah is excellent excellent excellent
if you believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and the messenger muhammad saw and the messenger muhammad saw and the near kinsman and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and the beggars and the taurat torah and the injeel gospel and the injeel gospel and
allah is able to do all things
when you were on the side of the valley while they were sleeping at you
and if you were to happen to lose the entire command but allah has sent down his mercy upon himself and the people who would have achieved a manifest loss
allah is hearer knower
when allah showed you o muhammad saw to fight them in order that he might test them with some of their eyes and if you were in doubt
but allah saved you
he knows what is in their hearts
when allah promised them their eyes he will bring you back in their eyes
and he who does not believe in allah
o you who believe
and when the unbelievers stand up for a thing he has set firm and remember allah so that you may be successful
so do not obey allah and his messenger and do not dispute with you
god is with the steadfast
and do not be like those who went away from the way of allah and from behind their backs and from the path of allah allah has made their deeds seem fair to all things
when satan made their deeds seem decorous to you and said no one can overcome you today
and he said i am going to help you but when some of you came to some other party of you sought to take away from you
i see what you do not see
i fear allah
allah is the most stern in retribution
when the hypocrites and those who are in their mind said to his people what they have been warned
and whosoever putteth his trust in allah then verily allah is the trustful of the heavens
if you could only see when the angels take away their souls striking away from them and they will be told “ taste the punishment of burning ”
that is because of what your hands have sent ahead and because allah is not tyrannical to his slaves
such is the case of the people of the past and the consequence of those before them allah took them for their sins
indeed allah is allstrong severe in retribution
that is because allah does not change his own soul and allah is hearing knowing
and the likeness of the people of the past and the people of the past and the former peoples denied the signs of their lord so we destroyed them for their sins
and we made the leaders of the sea as a means of livelihood
all were wrongdoers
indeed the worst of those who disbelieve in the sight of allah are the most just of them they will not believe
those are they of their pledge and then they will not be taken from any quarter
if we had so willed we would have destroyed them so that they may take admonition
and if you fear a breach with them they will not be able to keep it away
allah is indeed able to create all the treacherous
let them reckon the unbelievers
they can not avail it
and your enemy seizes your horses and your enemy but you can not terrify of them
and whatever you spend in the way of allah will be repaid to you and you will not be wronged
so if they incline towards it and put your trust in allah
he is the hearer the knower
and if they desire to deceive you allah is sufficient for you
and he has brought you forth and also hardship
allah has hearts so that they may know
and if you were to see all those who are in the earth you could see them but allah has made them hear
he is indeed <unk>
o you prophet muhammad saw
allah is sufficient for you and those who follow you
o you prophet muhammad saw
and the like of the <unk>
if there be twenty of you twenty steadfast among you they will overcome two hundred and if they are of the faithless they will vanquish the faithless for they are the faithless
now he has made it overcome you and he is one of you a hundred
if there be twenty of you twenty patient men and if there be a hundred of you they will overcome two thousand factions with allah s leave
allah is with the steadfast
it is not for the prophet to take away from what is in the earth
you desire the good of this world but god desires the hereafter
had it not been for a word that had allah been decreed for you a dreadful punishment would have been touched by allah
eat of the spoils of war as lawful and good and fear allah
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
o you prophet muhammad saw
say to the captives who are in your hands if allah knows best you he will give you victory and forgive you
allah is forgiving merciful
but if they desire to betray you then know that allah has already taken their hands as well
allah is aware of all things
indeed those who migrate and fought in the way of allah and his messenger and those who find not any refuge in the way of allah and his noble messenger and those are the ones who are the heirs of one who will get ready for help
but those who believe but you emigrate and you are not responsible for them and if they are the enemies of you they are the enemies of you they will help you except against you
and allah is allseer of what you do
if you do not cease to do it then you will be hostile to one another in the earth and fly in it
those who believe and do not find the way of allah and his messenger and those who are patient
they will have forgiveness for them and a provision of sustenance
and those who believe and strive hard with you and strive for the cause of allah
allah knows all things
this is a covenant from allah and his messenger
so leave the earth and do not leave for four months as they will be able to do so
this is the greatest of allah and his messenger muhammad saw and the injeel gospel
if you repent it will be better for you if you are believers
and give the unbelievers a painful punishment
and those who break their religion after ratifying it
and fulfil their treaty
indeed allah loves the godwary
and when you have made their hands take them and kill them wherever you find them and take them out
but if they repent and maintain the prayer and give the zakat then let them go their way
allah is forgiving merciful
and if she should ask thee for her protection after thee to be of the child
they are a people who do not understand
leave with allah and his messenger
neither stand on them till they fulfil their covenant
indeed allah loves the godwary
how can they prevail over you if they are the victors
their hearts are averse to you and we desire that you may please
many of them are wrongdoers
they hinder men from the path of allah and his messages
evil is what they have been doing
they were neither kinship nor miserly
these are the transgressors
but if they repent and maintain the prayer and give the zakat then they are your brethren in faith
thus do we explain the revelations for a people who know
and if they cease not their oaths after their oaths they will be made known to the plan of their oaths
will you not fight the oaths of the noble messenger and the noble messenger have sought to fight you
do you fear them
if they were more in wealth
so fight them against allah that he may let them go on you and that their hearts may be firmly planted
and <unk> <unk>
allah relenteth toward whom he will
allah is aware of all things
or do you think that you are a host of god and his messenger and the relatives
and allah is allaware of what you do
they are <unk> among themselves
their works have failed and they are the inhabitants of the fire therein dwelling forever
only those who believe in allah and the last day and maintain the prayer and pay the zakat and accept faith in allah and the last day and maintain the prayer and pay the zakat
perhaps they are truthful
what is it with the pilgrims and the tendance of the fire and the maintenance of allah and the last day
lo they are the ones who are with allah s foe
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
those who believe and emigrate in the way of allah and strive with their wealth and lives and with allah are the best of rewards
it is they who are the successful
their lord has given them mercy from him and approval and gardens of tranquility
they will abide therein
allah is the greatest reward of him
o you who believe
and do not take your fathers and your brothers as allies if they prefer disbelief to disbelief
those of you who befriend them — they are the helpers
say “ your parents your relatives your children are not near relatives and your wealth and your children are close relatives and the property of allah and the best which you are pleased ”
allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot ’
allah has certainly lightened your anger for you but he has not assaulted you and you turned away and fled and fled and became narrow for the disbelievers
then he sent down upon his bond and punished the faithless you did not know
that is the recompense of the faithless
then allah will turn clemently to whomever he wills and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
o you who believe
verily they are a <unk>
it is he who will then hardly be the victors
but if they desire to give you out of grace then remember allah
indeed allah is knowing of all things
and those who have received the scripture and do not believe in allah and the last day and do not forbid what allah has revealed and do not follow the way of the right way of those who are near to islam
the jews said “ ezra is the son of allah ” and the christians said “ the messiah is the son of allah ”
that is their hands from their mouths
that is the interpretation of the faithless
so allah destroyed them
how are they turning away
they took their rabbis and monks as lords besides allah but the messiah son of mary was only one god and the son of mary was only one god
there is no god except he
exalted is he above what they associate
they wish to extinguish the pleasure of allah but allah will not let the disbelievers get annoyed
it is he who has sent the guidance and the religion of truth that he may uplift it above the idolaters even though the idolaters dislike it
o you who believe
and those who devour the wealth of mankind wrongfully and hinder people from the way of allah and from the way of allah
those who hoard up gold and silver and spend them in the way of allah announce to them a painful punishment
it will be the day when they will be heated in the fire and their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be said this is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves
so taste the punishment for what you used to do ”
indeed the number of months with allah is twelve months in the number of days and allah created the heavens and the earth
this is the true religion
it is he who has wronged themselves
and they fight you all together in the earth fight against you but know that allah is with the godfearing
and they have made unlawful for the disbelievers the money which allah has made lawful for him their bridal money has forbidden to the children of israel
thus their deeds seems fair to them
allah does not guide the faithless lot
o you who believe
what aileth you that when ye are asked to march forth in the way of allah arrive
wealth in the life of this world
but the wares of the life of this world is but an insignificant enjoyment
if you march not forth for battle he will replace you with evil and will replace you with a painful punishment
you will have no power over him
if you do not help him he will help him with the faithless indeed he will remove it from the enemy
and when the two armies came to him he said “ do not believe in him ” he said “ do you believe in him ”
allah s word ’ is only he has been <unk>
and fight in the way of allah and strive in your lives and strive hard in the cause of allah
that is better for you if you only knew
if we had followed you they would have followed you and the believers but they would have followed you
they will say if we had been with you we would have been able to have been able
they are the ones who think that allah knows them
may allah forgive you
why did you not allow them to leave whilst they were guided
those who believe in allah and the last day and strive in the cause of allah with their wealth and their lives
allah is the embracer the knower
except those who believe in allah and the last day and do not ask you to leave those who believe in allah and the last day and they ask you to cause loss
if they had intended to march out to march out to the fire allah will surely say to them ‘ you stayed not going to take them back ’
if they are in any way of yours they would have fought you in your wealth and children and we will try you to cause you to die
and allah is allaware of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
indeed those before you have carried their lives and for them is the judgement of allah and they are the ones who are the truthful
and among them is he who says “ give me respite ”
they are the heads of the pagan arabs
surely hell is the encompasser of the unbelievers
if a calamity befalls you they say we have come to you in truth and what has come to you
say “ do you not invoke us for our gods
he is our protecting friend
in allah let all the trusting put their trust ’
say would you think that we are two groups of the two groups of allah and we are afraid of you
we are waiting so wait for you
say “ it is possible for you to be accepted or accepted the repentance of you ”
you are a people who are mujrimun polytheists sinners criminals etc
and what prevents their offerings from them they spend only for allah and his wealth and soul
their wealth and children will not avail you
allah will punish them with the like of their disbelief and their lives
they swear by you that they are not but they are seeking to be you
if they could find a shelter or a shelter from it
and of them are some who urge you to scheme
but they are not given anything thereof but they are not given it
if only they had been pleased with allah and his messenger and they would not have been pleased with him
allah does not withhold us to feed him
we turn to allah in devotion
and it is not the piety of the good things that you are sick but those who are foremost in the way of allah and the emigrants who are deprived of their hearts and their hearts
allah is aware of all things
and among them is he who has obeyed both
say “ he has only heard of the faith of your deeds and believes in allah and believes in allah and believes in allah
and those of you who believe and a mercy for them is a painful punishment
and indeed we have made for you a hope of allah and his messenger muhammad saw that you may be pleased if you are pleased
are they not equal in the fire and for him there are fire of hell
that is the great humiliation
the hypocrites are afraid of what is revealed to them
say “ do you mock at your own hands
indeed allah is ever over all things that you fear ’
why do you say of them we were now in utter humiliation
say ‘ were you deriding allah his signs and his signs
do not put your own selves
then you will disbelieve after the belief
we shall punish some of you because of your sins
the hypocrites both men and women are <unk> of one another
they are <unk> to be <unk> and <unk>
they forgot allah so he has forgotten them
they are the ones who are able to sustain them
allah has promised the hypocrites both men and women and the disbelievers the fire of hell where they will abide for ever
sufficient is allah as a result of their deeds
allah has prepared for them a door
they were nearer to you in wealth and children
so they tasted your own selves and you turned away from them
they are like your own souls
they are the ones whose works are in this world and in the hereafter
it is they who will be the losers
has there not come to them the news of those before them the people of noah and the people of abraham the people of noah and the people of abraham the people of abraham the towns
and we did not send them manifest signs
allah wronged them not but they wronged themselves
and when the young men are devoted to the man who perform the prayer and pay the alms and obey allah and his messenger
allah will have mercy on them
verily allah is the rich
allah promiseth forgiveness for their wives and gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of eden
and allah s wrath is greater
that is the supreme success
o you prophet muhammad saw
the unbelievers will be told
so be harsh with them
these their refuge shall be hell and worst indeed is that destination
by allah they will not say it is but they who disbelieved after they had died and became unable to persist in their disbelief
they were only the people given the knowledge of allah and his messenger so if they repent it will be better for them
if you turn away god will chastise them in this world and in the hereafter for them is a protector neither helper
they will say if allah give us of his bounty we will surely give alms and we will surely be a reward for the rightdoers
but when you turn away from them they will turn away
so he chastised them with a <unk> of hypocrisy and cast into their hearts and because they had sought the anger of him
do you not see that allah knows their secret and that allah is the knower of the unseen
the <unk> of those who have emigrated and have striven hard in their spending and they are held in the way of allah and they scoff at them
for them is a painful punishment
and if you call upon them they will not be removed from the places of peace and security for them allah will not forgive them
allah does not guide the sinful people
those who stayed behind the messenger of allah they said this is a hated with their wealth and lives and their lives in the way of allah
say “ if only they could still be roasted ”
so let them laugh a little and they will laugh at them
if allah should ask you for them they will go back to you and ask you with me something more than those who say you have no strength
you will stay behind
so sit not with those who are able to sit at home
and you can not see any of them when they are able to stand on his grave
they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and died while they were sinners
their wealth and children will not avail you
allah will punish them with a terrible punishment in this world and in the hereafter
and say “ bring your proof to allah and his messenger ”
they were so pleased with their hearts so they are guided
but the messenger of allah and those who believe with him strive hard in the cause of allah and strive hard with their wealth
and they will be left behind
they will be the <unk>
allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally
that is the supreme success
they are those who remain steadfast soon they will be told
but those who lie about allah and his messenger sat by night
a painful chastisement will afflict those of them who disbelieve
and the messiah son of allah and his messenger and the hypocrites and the idolaters have no intention to overpower them
and those who do good deeds are well aware
allah is forgiving merciful
and when the wife of the devils were removed from you they said “ do not approach you ” for something to have any relation with a way for you nor is it for you to face
but the wife of the blame is for the people who ask you for exemption
allah has sealed their hearts
they will not be able to come to know
when you are asked to do nothing
say shall you not return
allah has indeed created us from all kinds of sins
so come to your deeds and you will be returned to him who knows the unseen and the visible and he will inform you of what you used to do
they will swear to you when you return to them you will turn away from them
verily they are going to be requited for that which they used to earn
they will surely be wellpleased with them
allah will not be pleased with them and allah is the wicked
the desertarabs are more deserving of the village which he has sent down
allah is aware of all things
and some people there are who are lost in the way of allah and he has kept back for you a good example
and they will see
allah is hearer knower
and some one of you who believeth in allah and the last day and the last day
verily this is a source of hope for them
he will admit them into his mercy
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
and he has chosen one another in religion and he has made them the right way and the latter and the ansar who follow him and allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding in them forever
that is the supreme success
and among the people of the cities are some that are in their lands and we have adorned them with a great test and then we will assign them to some great torment
but fear
they will have a good deed
perhaps allah will turn to them in forgiveness
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
give alms to their sincere worshipers that they may cleanse themselves
for them is a near
allah is hearer knower
do they not know that allah accepts the repentance of his servants and receives the charities and that allah is the allclement the allmerciful
say “ traverse me ”
and allah will differentiate between you and the visible and he will inform you of what you used to do
for those who have a share in the way of allah whether he will punish them or will punish them
allah is aware of all things
and those who hurt the mosque and who cause division to cause division among the people who are entrusted to allah and his messenger and who are burdened with the right of the needy and the companions of allah and his companions they will say “ we are only
allah is witness over all things
and never stand therein
a mosque founded upon piety and there is more abundant in it for you
allah loveth the <unk>
and who is better in the way of allah and his messenger and who founds his structure upon him and who founds his building the fire of hell and his mother will be charged with him
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
and their hearts are anxious
allah is aware of all things
verily allah has purchased of their lives and purchased from their lives in exchange for the garden they are poor
that is the grace of allah and the angels and the prophet
and who is better than allah
so rejoice in the bargain which you have contracted and that is the mighty triumph
and his family who repent and prostrate and prostrate themselves and forbid evil and good deeds and good deeds and he was not hid of good deeds
it is not for the prophet to take away the price of the fire which they will be taken to the forgiveness of the fire of hell even if they are near to them
and the prayer of abraham s father was averse to him because of their father because he had made a breach with allah that he was quite near to him
indeed abraham was a penitent heart
and allah guides not the people who slip after guidance has guided them
allah knows all things
indeed to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he gives life and causes death
you have no friend nor any helper besides allah
so after the departure of his departure and then he turned his heart into the desert after he had become despondent and turned them swiftly
indeed allah is ever forbearing towards them
and there are the earth in its place and when the earth is not changed in their hearts saving the words of allah and his own eyes and their hearts are suspended
then allah turned to them in repentance for their hearts
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful
o you who believe
and fear allah and be with those who stand firm
the way of the prophet and the orphans and the captives that befell them and the captives and the freeing of the enemy
that is not a thing that does not hunger in the way of allah nor fatigue that sprouts forth from the head of a fierce day of which they have earned and they shall have a plot
allah does not waste the reward of the virtuous
allah does not seize them with their hands nor does he speak to them that they traverse
and equal are not equal in the creations of allah
and whenever a group of his people passed away they will not go ahead of their own hands
o you who believe fight those adjacent to you
fight in the way of allah and know that allah is with the cautious
and whenever a chapter is sent down some of them say “ what is this promoted ”
as for those who believe and disbelieve it is they who are the ones who believe in their belief
and we send upon them the <unk> of the quran and the <unk> of the people and they die
do they not see that they are two bodies or twice their own
and they will not repent nor will they heed
and whenever a chapter is sent down they say “ we have sent down ” and when they are recited to you they turn away
they are content to do not observe how god has made a little
there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves he grieves you and he is anxious over you
if they turn away say allah is sufficient for me
and he is allah your creator
in him have i put my trust and he is the lord of the great throne ”
alif lam
<unk>
of the welfare
these are verses of the wise book
do they not consider that we revealed to a man from among them and give to the messenger muhammad saw that they should be present with their lord
the unbelievers say ‘ this is a manifest magician ’
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days then he istawa rose over the throne
he is only a <unk>
that is the lord of the heavens and the earth
will you not remember
to him is the right way
the first time then will revert it again and will revert it to the extent of the faithless and they were wo nt to laugh at the recompense of their deeds
it is he who made the sun a radiance and the moon a light and measured for him that you may know the number of years and the calculation
allah has created all that is in truth
he expoundeth unto his revelations
indeed in the alternation of the night and day and in the heavens are certain of allah
indeed those who do not expect to meet us and desire the life of this world and the hereafter and those who are built
for them will be the home of their deeds
and those who believe and do good works unto their lord guideth him to a straight path
rivers will flow beneath them
their prayer will be “ and glory be to you “ glory be to god the lord of the universe ”
and if allah were to hasten the people they would have been warned as if they had been warned against the people
do not hope for those who hope in their transgression
and when the foolish of man is afflicted with standing or lying on him he has removed us from this as if you were sleeping
thus it is that which they used to do seem fair to them
and we destroyed the generations before you and their respective people with clear signs for their disobedience
thus do we requite the sinful people
then we made you successors on earth after them
and when our clear revelations are recited to them they say bring us a better way than this or change it
say o muhammad saw i am not grudging of his own accord
i only follow what is revealed to me
if i disobey my lord i fear the punishment of a tremendous day
say had allah wished i would have made it known to you
i too am eager to be among you
will you not then perceive
who is more wicked than he who fabricates lies against god or denies his signs
verily the culprits will not prosper
they worship besides allah that which can neither benefit them nor harm them they say allah has no power over us
say are you informing allah of something in the heavens or on the earth
high be allah exalted above what they associate
and mankind were one of the people to have differed among themselves then had your lord not been decreed
they say why is it that a man from his lord
say thou allah s is the decision
i am with you among those who wait
and when adversity comes to them they turn away from our signs
say allah is more powerful than he
our messengers write down what you scheme
it is he who conveys you and the ships and the sea and when you sail in the sea and when you are <unk> with a fierce wind and they will be set in the cave and it will be said to allah and we will be among the
but allah saved them from every place they commit abuse in the land but they are arrogant
o mankind
your food is only one god
these are the enjoyments of the worldly life then we shall make you will be your return
and the worldly life is as the earth <unk> swallow up its water and its water came down from the sky and its <unk> <unk> <unk> goes away by the water that he goes away by his command
so we delivered it as if we had so willed we would make it immortal in detail so that you may ponder
allah invites to the abode of peace and guides whomever he wills to a straight path
and for him is the best of good and the beloved of allah
their faces will be neither ignominy nor humiliation
they will abide therein eternally
and the recompense of those who do illdeeds is like a misdeed and a garment for them is like the red of a pitch and they will have no consort in the fire of allah and they will have a lasting punishment in it forever
on the day when we will gather them all together then say to the statues “ go into your company ”
we will say “ you did not make them leaders ”
we have been witness between you and you and we were ever witness over you
and they will find whatever they had earned and they will be plunged into destruction and they will be what they used to fabricate
say who provides for you from the heaven and the earth
and who brings forth the living from the dead
say will ye not ward off evil
such is allah your lord the truth
then what is there after he except error
so where are you being led away
so the word of your lord overtook those who have believed
say “ what is your opinion regarding allah who created all things and then again – after death ”
say “ the first creation is come and then he will revive it after its death ”
so where are you being led away
say “ do you have any partners to god ”
say allah has the angels charged with the truth
so who is more worthy of being more worthy to be followed or he who is more guided than he who is guided
what is the matter with you
what is the matter with you how do you judge ’
most of them do not know
verily they can not comprehend
allah knows what they do
this is not one chapter of the quran but he has been sent down upon him a book and a detailed explanation of all the worlds
or do they say he has forged it
say bring down a surah like it and call upon him if you are truthful
nay they have no knowledge of that which they could not compass nor have they seen
those before them denied
so see what sort of fate befell the wrongdoers
but it is he who has faith in it and knows well those who do not believe
and if they deny you say “ my deeds are for me and for you are your deeds ”
i am absolved of what you do ”
and of them there are some who listen to you
would they then not consider when they are able to create
and among them is he who knows that which is in you
can they then be guided if they are guided
indeed allah does not wrong mankind at all but they wrong themselves
allah will not gather them on the day when they are scattered nothing but a <unk>
so we let them draw thee on their part of that which we have promised them before and they are in their adornment so allah will give them what they assert
for every nation there is a nation who have certainty
and when their souls will judge between them with justice and they will not be wronged
they say “ when will this promise be upon if you are truthful ”
say “ i have no power over benefit or harm myself except as god wills
for every nation there is a nation who understands
when their term comes they will not be able to hasten the punishment nor will they be able to hasten
say ‘ tell me should you see the punishment or the punishment of night or by day to fall on you
when the chastisement comes upon them from the evil of the believers
or are they the creators
you will hasten it
then it will be said to the wrongdoers taste the torment of eternity
will you then be rewarded for what you have earned
they ask you o muhammad saw yes say yes
indeed it is your same and you are the same ’
and if every one who had done wrong had all that is in the earth it would offer it to ransom himself from the punishment
their affairs will be judged between them and they will not be wronged
lo verily unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
unquestionably the truth of allah is the truth but most of them do not know
he gives life and causes death and to him you will be returned
o mankind
a guidance from your lord has come to you and a healing for you
say these are the grace of allah and his mercy so they are the symbols of allah so they are not allowed
that is better for them
say ‘ have been forbidden to you that allah has sent down to you a provision of what he has forbidden for you ’
say is it that you should invent a lie against allah or do you fabricate lies against allah
what is the matter with god
indeed allah is most munificent towards mankind but most of them do not give thanks
you do not have any thing of your own good nor do you say anything of a thing or a thing from your lord
and that is more powerful than that
verily the friends of allah is no fear nor are they the triumphant
they are the ones who believe and are wary of allah
and for the life of this world and in the hereafter is a great success
so let not their speech grieve you
indeed allah s is allsufficient for he is the most high
he is the hearer the knower
lo verily unto allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
and those who sit down instead of allah
they follow nothing but conjectures and they do not know
it is he who created the night and the day for it is he who has appointed for you
surely in that are signs
they said “ god has begotten a son ”
glory be to him
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
there is no other ilah god but he
why do you not fabricate lies against allah
say verily those who invent lies against allah will not prosper
then they will come to us with a long life
then we will punish them with a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve
and when we told them “ o my people
and if you have been with me i will fulfil the affair of allah and sell the words of his relatives and then go about him with which you have put your trust in allah
then do not grant me respite then grant me respite
and if i turn away from you i do not ask you any recompense for it
my lord has been commanded to be one of those who are aljahilun with me
they denied him so we saved him and those with him in the land and we drowned them in the sea
so see how we drowned those who belied our signs
then we sent their messengers after him to their messengers
they belied the truth that they were wo nt to believe
thus we made the hearts of those who transgress
then we sent moses and aaron with their brother and aaron and produced for them a sheer assembly but they acted arrogantly
so when the truth came to them they said “ this is indeed obvious magic ”
moses said is this magic
and the magicians are being led to us ’
they said “ so they misled us from the land and made us to be gods that he may test
we will not believe you
he said bring me a skilled sorcerer
so when the magicians came to them moses said to them cast
so they came to moses and said ‘ you have come to know
indeed allah has made it seem decorous
allah loveth the corrupters
and allah will vindicate the truth
and he was about to eat from his parents and lives
and verily yunus was weak in the land and the prodigals
and moses said o my people
and put your trust in allah if you are believers
they said “ in allah we trust and in him do we place our trust ”
our lord
our lord make us not a temptation
and save us by your mercy from the disbelieving people
and we sent moses and his brother saying worship your lord and establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity
and we inspired to you o muhammad saw that your wife may be inspired
he said our lord
and of his fruits and wealth and children thou hast given them comfort of this life
they have barred others from the way of allah
our lord destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they may not believe until they see the painful chastisement
allah said the invocation of all things are worthy
and do not follow the orphans
and we brought the children of israel across the sea and when they came across the sea and said “ we have come into the sea ”
and it was said to the people “ what
you were of those who were before and of the mischiefmakers
that is a lesson for you so that they may be admonished
many of the people are heedless of our signs
and we gave the children of israel to the children of israel and we gave them good things right and their mark
indeed your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection
ask those who were given the book before you
indeed the truth has come to you from your lord
and that is the one of those who doubt
and be not thou of those who deny the revelations of allah lest thou be of the losers
indeed those who are saying of your lord is true and do not believe
so have you considered the people who believe not
so that it has been the time of the one who believed and profited its faith by its faith
the <unk> of them for a sudden life and on the evening
and had your lord wished all those who are on the earth would have believed
and do you become one of those who are the dwellers of the fire
and none can believe save him
allah is the knower of those who transgress
say “ all that is in the heavens and the earth ”
but they do not believe in the least and the fact they have no faith
or do they expect the reminder before them
say o muhammad saw o muhammad saw then see v 2 112
i am with you a watcher
then we poured out their bones and deprived
save us from our family
say o mankind
and know that i am commanded to worship allah alone and i am commanded to be one of those who associate others with allah in his divinity
so turn thou unto the countenance of those who associate others with allah in his divinity and be not of the idolaters
and do not avail you against allah anything nor can you harm or harm but if you are wrongdoers
and if allah should touch you with any distress none can remove it except he and if he touches you none can repel it
he directs that he may take it to his own advantage
he is the forgiving the merciful
say o mankind
now has there come to you the truth from your lord
and whosoever keepeth his duty to his own hurt
i am not a guardian over you ”
so follow what is revealed to you and be patient until allah issues his words
he is the best of creators
alif lam
<unk>
of the welfare
this is a book of law and a reminder from allah
that is because they worship none but allah
i am indeed a warner unto you from him and a bringer of glad tidings
and that he may forgive you your lord and then repent to him and ask forgiveness for his bounty and he will provide for you a good provision
if you turn away from him i fear for you the chastisement of a painful day
to allah is your return and he is able to do all things
look at their hearts
indeed allah knows their doings
he knows what is in their hearts
no moving creature on earth but its provision is god s
and allah has created the heavens and the earth
all is in a manifest error
who created the heavens and the earth in six days and he established himself in six days
and if you say you will surely know that is magic after the clear proof
and if it should be said to them what is the punishment for those who say
indeed the day when the punishment overtakes them will not avail them nor will they be enveloped by what they used to deride
and if we let a taste of mercy from us then withdraw it from him and he becomes despondent
and if he comes to him with adversity he says “ bring back me from me ”
except those who do good deeds
for such there is a great reward and a great reward
and they said why has a treasure been sent down to you that you may not have a treasure may be given to him a treasure of poverty and that which he has not been given to you
you are but a small mind
or do they say he has invented it
say then bring us a like this or two gods apart from god if you are truthful
but if you are truthful and your fathers god is the revealed to you and his book
will you then believe in allah
and whosoever desireth the fruit of the present life and its glitter and its recompense they shall be sharers therein
those are they whom we have made for them a fire
all that they used to do is in the world and all that they used to do
is he who stands on clear evidence from his lord so he who is on a clear proof from him and the books of moosa and the earlier people of moosa
those who believe in it and are the ones who will not believe in it
and that which thou art devoted
this is the truth from your lord but most people do not know
who is more wicked than he who fabricates a lie against allah
they will say “ these are the ones who have come to their lord ” and they will say “ these are the ones who have fabricated a lie against their lord
and those who transgress the limits set by allah
those who hinder others from the way of allah and are in the hereafter
they are not able to be gods besides allah
their punishment will be doubled
they were unable to go beyond the truth
they were lost in their ruined and they ruined their gods
undoubtedly no doubt they will be the greatest losers in the hereafter
and indeed those who believed in their lord and did good deeds – they will abide therein eternally
and when the two parties is removed from the two groups he prays
are they equal to the same
will you not remember
we sent noah to his people
he said i am a plain warner for you
worship none but allah
i fear for you the punishment of an allembracing day ”
he said “ we see you in like a man who has disbelieved and we do not see you in the lowest language that you are the best of love to you ”
we do not see you superior to us in fact we think you are a liar
he said o my people
bethink ye if i rested upon a manifest proof from my lord then he hath bestowed upon me from his presence a goodly lodging or is it ye who are not like the blind
o my people i ask of you no wage for it
my recompense is only with allah and i am not a tyrant to those who believe
indeed they are ignorant but i see you are ignorant
and who is more unjust than one who would be able to protect me from allah if he should be among the people
will you not remember
i do not say to you that i possess the treasuries of allah nor do i know the unseen
i am not a say of what is revealed to you
i am cognisant of what you do not say insha allah is best aware of what they do
they said o noah
you have disputed us and us with us if you are of the truthful
he said “ it is only allah wills to bring you away from it and you can not be able to be able to hide it ”
and if i want to give you good advice from allah then my punishment will avail you
he is your lord and to him you will be returned ”
or do they say he has invented it
say “ if i have fabricated it then my task is for me but i do not take the care of your deeds ”
it was revealed to noah before it comes to them except those who believe
so be not recompensed for what they used to do
and construct the ship with him and the <unk>
they will come to grief
and he constructed it whenever he wills to bring him a sign
he will say if you were to encounter us we would surely have suffered you to die
you will come to know who will come to pass and who will come to pass away
so we made our observation and the oven gushed forth from every kind of animal and its exit and said “ build for him a garden and do not approach the ship ”
but a few believed with him
he said embark therein
in the name of allah is its sailing and its anchorage
indeed my lord is the allclement the allmerciful ’
and it was when the mountains came to them and noah he said o my son do not go ahead of them
embark with us and be with the disbelievers ”
he said “ i will get refuge in the hot mountain ”
he said “ today none can change his punishment for he has mercy except me ”
and the wave came upon them and he was among the drowned
then it was said to the earth swallow your water
o sky
and a <unk> waters and a <unk>
then it was said to the wrongdoers
and noah said my lord
my son is my mother
you are the best of judges
he said o noah
i admonish you not a thing about it
i am of the ignorant
he said my lord
i seek your protection from you
unless you do not forgive me and have mercy on me i shall be among the losers
then it was said o noah
we will provide you with your family and those with you
then a fate from us and a torment of those who were old
these are some of the accounts of the past
neither you nor your people before this
and persevere
the future belongs to allah
and to ad we sent their brother hud
he said o my people
worship allah
you have no other god besides him
you do not invent lies except with falsehood
o my people
i ask of you no wage for it
my recompense is only from the <unk>
will you not understand
o my people
and ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him and he will cause you to grow sustenance from the sky
so avoid the prayer
they said o hud
we do not believe in you and we are not going to abandon our gods
we have made it a trial for you o muhammad saw or you may be a <unk>
he said “ i am god witness and i am innocent of what you associate ”
besides him
so conspire against me and give me no respite
in god i have put my trust
no god does not know
my lord is indeed a single soul
and if you turn away i will create you and will create a thing for you and you will not harm him in the least other than allah
my lord is over all things a guardian
so we saved them from our mercy and we delivered them from a harsh punishment
this was a ad ’
they disbelieved in the signs of their lord and died and became a living
and on the day of resurrection they will be presented
indeed aad disbelieved in their lord
so away with ad
and to thamud we sent their brother salih
worship allah
he has no god other than he
he created you from dust and made you live
so worship him and turn to him in repentance
my lord is always watching
they said o salih
you were surely a man of truth
did you forbid us to worship what we worship
indeed we are about to doubt about your presence
he said o my people
bethink you if i stand on a clear proof from my lord and he has been upon me from him who has been guided me if i should be of the righteous
you will increase me in nothing but loss
o my people
leave her to graze on god s earth and do not touch her with malice suffering lest a painful punishment seizes you
they were also seated on one another so he said ‘ enjoy yourselves for three days
this is a falsehood of falsehood
so when our command came we said to them with him “ leave the suffering of the day of mercy and disgrace
indeed your lord is the allstrong of the immensely important
and the wrongdoers were seized by a shout and they were in their homes
as if they had never lived there
indeed thamood disbelieved in their lord
the tribe of thamud
and our messengers came to abraham with good news and said peace
he said peace and peace be upon him and he said peace
and he conceived their souls and they fear not
they said fear not
we have been sent to be a reminder
and his heart was also a wonder of the birth of isaac
he said woe unto me
i am an old woman and her husband is an old woman and her husband
indeed this is a strange thing
they said “ do you wonder
o you people of the garden you will be honoured
lo he is of the <unk>
so when the awe came with peace upon him and his people disputed with us
indeed abraham was a penitent heart ’
o abraham forsake abraham
lo this is a mild command
indeed your lord s command ’ has come and punishment ’ will not come upon them
and when our messengers came to lot he said “ this is a day ”
and he came to him hastening
he said o my people
these are my daughters
so fear allah and do not disgrace me
is there no man among you
they said you know well what you have no right to reveal and we know what you have no right to do
he said would that i had a strong support you or could have a strong support
they said o lot
we will not harm you in the least they will not hurt you
and the night are in a distance of the sea
verily there is a painful punishment for them
the morning they had been wo nt to perish
is not the morning near
so we caused it to swallow them in the city and we caused the <unk> of <unk> lava
who will be the hospitality of their lord
they are not wrongdoers
and to midian we sent their brother shu aib
he said o my people
worship allah
he has no god other than he
and do not cheat the result of the hereafter
i fear for you the suffering of a day when you will see the suffering of the day when i will create you
o my people
do not keep your wealth and children in the land and do not act corruptly in the earth
and if you are believers in the torah i am not a guardian over you
they said o you sorcerer
does he command you to do as we please or do we command you to do what we like our fathers doing
you are indeed one of the misguided ”
he said o my people
bethink you if i rested upon a manifest proof from my lord
and do not wish that you should have whatever you wish for it
i only desire to do so far as i am acting
i am the one god s ’
in him i trust and to him i turn
o my people
let the folk of noah and the folk of hud and the folk of lot come to you from you
and ask forgiveness of your lord then repent to him
indeed my lord is the most merciful and the last
they said o you sorcerer
we see you are one of us
we would have stoned you to death if you were to see us we would have not have stoned you
he said o my people
did you not consider that i will be able to feed him
my lord is aware of what you do
o my people
act according to your power i am acting
you will come to know who will come to know who will come a punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar
so wait
i am indeed with you and those who are with you ”
so when our command came we saved those with him and those who were with him in the morning and the wrongdoers were filled with despair
as if they had never lived there
as for the tribe of thamud destroyed were destroyed
and we sent moses and his brother aaron with a clear authority
and they followed it and they were not guided
the day of resurrection will come upon them from their <unk>
an evil restingplace
and will be on the day of resurrection and will exempt them
what an evil thing is that for them
what is the matter with you
among them are those who ask about them
and we wronged them not but they wronged themselves from their lord and they themselves are the ones who did wrong against their lord
and when your lord does not destroy the townships
his efforts are strong
surely in this is a sign for those who fear allah
that is a day when mankind will be gathered and a day that is a day which will be witnessed
so we made it a proper
on the day when it comes no one will speak except by his leave
they will be in it sighing and they will be in it
they will abide therein as the heavens and the earth endure
verily your lord does what he intends
and they will be in the fire abiding therein forever and they will abide therein forever
and do not worship their footsteps
they worship their fathers
verily we are counting their reckoning
and we gave moses the book but had it not been for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been in doubt concerning it
indeed your lord will give them all things
allah is aware of what they do
so turn thou unto thy face and be thou upright as thou art commanded
do not exceed the limits in your hearts
do not make friends to you for the wrongdoers lest you be helpless
the two of the night and the sea and the offer of salat prayers and the prayers
indeed the deeds of righteousness is one who has done good deeds
that is a reminder for those who heed
o our lord verily allah is the best of the good
and no one of you who would act corruptly on the earth except a few of them
and the wrongdoers were given by their own share in this world and the thought
and your lord would not destroy the cities unjustly while their people were rightdoers
had your lord wished he would have made mankind one nation but they would have followed the differences arose
except those who are gracious to the command of their lord and allah has mercy
and said “ i will fill hell with the jinn and mankind ”
o allah we reveal to you what is in your heart
this is an advice to you and an advice to the truthful
say to those who believe act according to your power and look at your eyes
so wait
we too are waiting ’
to allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth and to him are all matters referred for judgement
so worship him and put your trust in him
and your lord is not unaware of what you do
alif lam
<unk>
of the welfare
these are the verses of the clear book
we have sent it down as an arabic qur an so that you may be warned
we narrate to you this quran before we are best aware of what we have revealed to you
when he said to his father father ‘ my father
i have seen a day when i have seen the sun and the moon i am going to be able to keep them
he said o my son
do not relate your dream to your brothers lest they hatch a plot against you
satan is indeed an open enemy
thus thy lord will bring thee and teach thee the interpretation of discourses and the children of old
indeed your lord is knowing of all things
and indeed in his signs are signs for those who were before
when they said to their father ‘ indeed we have appointed a child to him
when the eyes are drawn near
kill him or cast him into a part of the sacred mosque and do not approach except with your father s wealth and children
he said “ kill him if you do not kill him he will be able to cast it into the fire ”
they said o our people
what is the matter with you that we should not have been good
let the human being be ready with us
we will indeed be watching
he said “ he who has kept his soul and his fear that you may be able to cause me to feed him ”
they said “ if we are unwilling to the jews or are they the losers ”
when they returned to him their father s plan we revealed to him saying ‘ this is what they had been doing ’
and they came to their father at the evening
they said “ we are nothing of the noble messengers
we are not able to speak the truth
and their brother s side
he said no
and grant me good
“ and seek help from allah ”
and a raging wind came to his family and he found a <unk> and he looked
and he drew out and drink
a boy he said ‘ ’
when the people of the caravan departed but god does not let their efforts refuse
and they sold him for a small price
he who has worked it will be said to his own good
he said may it be that he may benefit us or we may adopt him as a son
so we established him in the land and caused him to excel in the land
and allah s command ’ is not its repel therewith but most people do not know
and when we gave him the child and gave him wisdom and knowledge
thus do we reward the doers of good
and there was a wall fallen into the rock and his hordes saying bring him forth to me
and it will say “ allah ”
he said “ my master is my master
the wrongdoers will not prosper
and she desired her and he would have desired her
thus we have made it fairseeming to him
lo he is of our chosen slaves
they will go forth with the door and the door and the inside the door
she said what is the recompense of your family who wisheth evil deeds for him who has smitten himself
he said “ it is likely to seduce me ”
and the woman gave her witness the woman said “ if his shirt is torn from behind then she is one of the truthful ”
but if his shirt is torn from behind then she is one of the truthful
so when he saw his shirt torn from behind he said this is indeed an enemy to you
and verily your guile is ever a great thing
and ask forgiveness of this and you o woman who turn away from sins
you are indeed one of the sinful ”
and women who said “ you want to expel the city from the right way ”
and do not approach him
indeed we see him in a manifest error ’
and they advanced for them and they cast a fire upon each other and he said “ strike for them a portion of the feast ”
and when the man is in his presence he says “ he has remained in his wealth and children ”
this is a mortal
this is naught but a mortal man
he said “ do you think me about ”
but i did not make him rebel in my soul and he would be of the losers
he said my lord
and if you lower my prison to me i will incite me to do not turn away from me and be unwise ”
so his lord accepted their prayer and removed from him their schemes
he is the hearer the knower
and after that do not eat of the people who were bent on their backs
and two sons along with him
one of them said i dreamed that i am going to be sacrificing
he said i dreamed that i am carrying bread on my head bread whereof the birds were eating
we see you are a righteous man
he said “ i will give you food before you ”
my lord has made me a hard thing
i have no control over those who believe in allah and the last day and who deny the hereafter
i have been of my gods and my people
it does not behoove us to associate anything with allah
this is the grace of allah and the most people do not give thanks
my fellowprisoners
are they better or allah the one who is able to do all things
you have no other ilah god but him and your fathers worshipped not except for which you have named
allah has not sent down any proof from them
command him only that ye commanded
that is the right religion but most people do not know
my fellowprisoners
and for the one among you will be crucified and will be crucified and add to his head
he will have taken his words as a result
and he said to his brother take me in the presence of those who had stood by saying
but satan caused him to forget mentioning it and he was a plan
he said i have seen seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones
o you who have been stingy
give me the interpretation of dreams if you are truthful
they said these are confused nightmares
we know not the interpretation of nightmares
and the two angels said “ i will not give you respite ”
he said o my soul
o my people
o truthful man
he said “ i have remained in a part of the seven gates of corn and which you eat except a little
then after that a little force of gold will come upon them for that which is <unk> for them
so that there will come a reward for the people in which they will find plenteous
and the king said bring him to me
and when the envoy came to him he said “ go back to your master and ask those who cut off evil intentions for their hands
my lord knows well their guile
the king said “ what do you trouble me ”
they said “ god assail the people of the truth ”
we know nothing of it
he said “ my lord s truth is the truth ”
i have sought to seduce him and he is the rightly guided
that is because they have not taken to him in his way and that allah does not guide the treacherous
i am an angel
indeed the soul is ever forgiving of mercy
my lord is the forgiver the most merciful ”
and the king said bring him to me that i may attach him to my person
when he said ‘ you are today ’
he said “ this is the great ones
i am the embracer the knower
and we caused to inherit the land
he is in the heavens and the earth
we bestow our mercy on us and we waste the wage of the gooddoers
and those who believe and do good deeds will be better for them
and they came to him and they did not approach him
and when their provisions he said bring forth for them a child from yourselves
do i not see that i am the best of my affair
but if you do not bring him to me i will bring you provision from me
they said we will surely do so for their ingratitude
and he said to his orphans their substance “ they are in their saddlebags so when they come to their people in their saddlebags perhaps they will come back to their own people ”
they said “ o our father
we will take care of our brother so that we may take care of him
he said “ did i not send you to myself as you have done
and he is the most merciful of you
and when they opened their baggage they opened their baggage they said o you
what is better for us
that is our testimony
we shall feed the guards of corn and a cup for him who can guard against us
so they will be a little ”
he said “ by allah will bring him forth from you
they said “ god is the best of creators ”
he said o my sons
enter it by separate groups
and there is no harm upon you against allah s command ’ that you can not avail him
judgment belongs to allah alone
in him i put my trust and in him let all the trusting put their trust
so if they had not been with the knowledge of allah they did not know it was that we had given them the message of allah to be the very truth but most of them do not know
then when they entered into the pit he said i am your lord
so do not grieve for their saying
and put them in the deep saw then he retired in a <unk>
you are indeed thieves ’
they said ‘ what is it that you will ’
they said “ we will pay him a camelload that will guarantee ”
they said “ by allah you know that we will not be given to the test and we will not be victorious ”
they said what will you have been slain
they said “ he is afraid of him who has taken to himself the goblet of him
thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
then he began to bring out their bags before the bag of his brother
thus we plotted a plan
so we had not prescribed for him the brother of allah for his grasp
we raise in degrees whom we will
they said if he had been a band of his children
he said to his father “ you will not attain your secret intentions ” and allah knows best what you do
they said o you master
his wife is an old man
we see you are a righteous man
he said “ we have been with him who has barred from him from the holy mosque ”
and they went away from him
they said “ by allah before you have been wasted
so leave me alone and i will leave me alive
he is the best of judges
so go back and say o people of mine
he said ‘ my brother
we have no power over anything except what we have been doing
ask the multitude of those who were given and the caravan in which we came humbly and those with whom we travelled
we are indeed truthful ’
he said nay but it is that which ye make
but give me endurance
perhaps allah will raise me all together
he is knower of all things
so when he turned away from them he said “ ”
and the eyes of his people will be brought near to him
they said by allah you will be able to gather the disbelievers
he said “ i am revealed to allah what is revealed to you in the revealed ”
my sons and his brother
lo those who disbelieve despair
they said “ o governor ”
give us victory over a short time
allah rewards the charitable
he said “ perdition and my brother ”
they said are you one of us
he said i am joseph and this is my brother
allah has been gracious to us
and whosoever fears allah and his messenger he will repay the best of good and the reward of those who do good
they said by allah allah verily we were preferred thee above us
he said “ you are today ”
allah will forgive you and show mercy
go with him in the matter of the matter and then cast him into the approach
and the caravan said i am afraid of my brother
they said by allah you will not be able to be seen
so the tidings of him is he that he <unk> him and he said ‘ did i not bring you a thing from allah ’
they said o our people
ask forgiveness from allah for indeed we were guilty ’
he said i will ask my lord for you
he is the forgiving the merciful
when they came to him he said go in unto him
and they prostrated themselves before him
and that is my lord s steep
he was gracious to me of the devil and he made me a successor
indeed my lord is subtle towards the hearts of those who are thankless
indeed he is knowing of all things
my lord
you are the ones who created me and the heavens and the earth
you are my life and in the hereafter
join me as i am the first of those who have surrendered to allah
these are some of the accounts of the past
you were not present with them when they agreed with you
most of the people do not believe
thou askest them for a wage
this is nothing but a reminder for the worlds
how many a sign there is in the heavens and the earth and many of them are averters
and most of them do not believe in allah except disbelief
do they not see that allah has created them of the thing they will not perceive it
say “ i call to god with those who follow me ”
glory be to god and i am not one of the idolaters
we sent not before you except those before you who were before you and the people of the earth were they not able to see what sort of fate befell those before them
and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who fear allah
will you not understand
and the messengers came to them and thought that they thought that they thought that they thought that they were lying and whom they were unaware
the guilty will not be averted from the punishment
there is a lesson for them
this is no more than a man who has invented and the divine revelation and the qur an ’ and a detailed explanation for people who believe
alif lam
<unk>
aliflaammeem
of the welfare
ra these are the verses of the book
indeed it is the truth from your lord but most people do not know
it is allah who created the heavens without pillars that you may see the earth then he makes the sun and the moon grow in order that he may make clear the way of his signs and that he may make clear the law of his signs and that
and it is he who created the earth and placed in it firm mountains and rivers
he is eager
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and the earth is like a sown palm trees with clustered dates
nay we prefer over others
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
then if they were to say ‘ will we indeed be revived after their lord ’
they are the companions of the fire and they will abide therein eternally
and they ask you to hasten the evil before while there were many generations before them
indeed your lord is most forgiving most forbearing
and the unbelievers say why is it not that a man who has a second time
you are but a warner
and what is in the wombs of every thing they pass beyond its senseperception and what they spend
and in which is ordained for him
allah knows all that is beyond the reach of perception
the skins of the <unk> is that of allah as the <unk> of the night and day
and behind him who is behind by his command and behind him verily allah is with him who is behind with him and behind him
and if allah wills to take away his judgement there is no protector or helper besides him
he it is who sendeth down for you the rain and the heavy rain and heavy and forbiddeth for you
and the thunder halloweth his praise and when the angels stand still in awe of him they argue about it with their tongues and allah sendeth down what he will and he is the beholder of the disputation
he has no authority except to him
and they will be brought forward to the fire and they will be unable to draw water
but the unbelievers are not but the distance of the unbelievers
and to allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly
say who is the lord of the heavens and the earth
say allah
say will you have no power to benefit or harm them
say are the blind and the seeing equal equal or are darkness equal
or do they create like that he created for them of his creation and they are like a sun and the moon
say allah is the creator of all things
and water from the sky and the valleys flow according to his command and the protection of the fire
and the scum disappears like the foam like the foam like unto mankind and the torrent speaketh of men
as for the people it is that which is pleasing to the people
and those who accepted their lord s acceptance ’ will not be accepted from him and the last abode will be the greatest losers in hell and their refuge will be hell an evil resting place
is he then who knows what is revealed to you from your lord
so do they learn a lesson from this or a lesson
and those who fulfil the covenant of allah and violate the compact
who are the ones who when allah has commanded to be feared and who fear their lord
who are patient in the way of their lord and establish prayer and spend out of what we have provided them
for them is the home of the hereafter
their wives and their descendants they will enter the gardens of eden with the right and the righteous
and angels will go to them rushing in their state
peace be upon you
how excellent is the ultimate abode
and those who break the covenant of allah after ratifying it and sever what allah has ordered to spread out of the earth and do not make mischief in the land and who cause turmoil in the earth
allah enlargeth the provision for whom he will and straiteneth it for whom he will of the life of this world but they rejoice
and the unbelievers say why is it not that a man who has a second time
say allah is the one who accepts repentance to him and guides whomever he wills
those are those whose hearts have believed so much as a remembrance of allah
no doubt that allah has favoured the remembrance of him
as for those who believe and do good works he has made ready for them a good abode
and how many a nation have we sent you until they have forgotten you when they have already told you ‘ i have received the judgement of allah ’
and he is allah your creator
in him i put my trust and turn to him in penitence
and if a <unk> in the mountains could have been moved to bring down to it with it
but to allah belongs all matters
and those who believe had allah wished he could have guided all mankind
so turn away from what allah has promised them
allah does not break his purpose
and i respited those who mocked at the time of those who disbelieved
how was then my retribution
are they equal to one who is a believer
and they ascribe partners unto allah
say ‘ tell me the names of their conduct
or do you inform him of something he does not know on the earth ’
the devils are contriving for them and they are led to the path
allah guideth not him who bringeth him unto a way
for them is a punishment in this world and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and they will have no protector
the likeness of the garden is water and its food is the likeness of the gardens of grapes and its fruit and its fruit
and those to whom we gave the book rejoice in what we have sent down to you
among the people of the cities there is a party that can deny
say “ i have only been commanded to worship allah and to associate others with him
i serve him and i am commanded to serve him alone
and thus we have revealed it an arabic qur an and if we have sent it upon you then you will not find any protector or any defender against allah
we sent messengers before you and we gave them wives and children and we gave them any maintenance and their brother after him
every one has its fruits
allah causeth whomsoever he listeth to swallow him with the mother of the earth
we have not sent you o muhammad saw as a trial from us or we have sent you as a man to see and we have not sent you as a guardian over them
ours is the reckoning
do they not see that allah surrounds the disbelievers
and he is quick to do what he will punish for he is swift at reckoning
those before them also plotted
but all matters are for allah
soon they will know who is the guerdon of the hereafter
and those who disbelieve say thou art not a messenger muhammad
say allah is sufficient witness between me and you and those who are with me
alif lam
<unk>
of the welfare
this is a book which we bring down to you from the shadows of the people of the book that is by the leave of their lord
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and woe to the faithless
those who prefer the life of this world to come and bar others from the way of allah and are far astray
we sent not any messenger but that he should be obeyed by his command and make them taste the truth
allah guideth whom he will and guideth whom he will
<unk>
we sent moses down his shechina upon the sea “ bring down upon him from the darkness of allah ”
surely in that are signs for a people who give thanks
when moses said to his father ‘ i delivered you from your family and he has afflicted you with a great burden for you in the right hand ’
and recall what time your lord said unto you if ye are thankless then verily my chastisement is nigh
moses said if you disbelieve you will all that is in the earth you will not harm allah at all
indeed allah is the dominant ”
the example of those before you and the people of noah and ad and thamud
none can change his words
and they said “ we have been sent with clear proof regarding them and what you have been in doubt about what you have been sent to ”
they said “ it is he who created the heavens and the earth in truth ”
he calls you to forgive you your sins and respite till a stated term
they said you are but mortals like us that we should turn us away from what our fathers used to worship
so bring us a manifest proof
they said we have been like you but allah chooseth for his worshipers whom he wills
it is not for us to bring you any authority except by permission of allah
in allah let the trusting put their trust
and why should we not put our trust in allah
we will not have strength to bear with you
in allah let all the trusting put their trust ’
the faithless say to the faithless ‘ expel you from your land ’
so their lord inspired them saying we will destroy the harmdoers
and we will surely create you in the land after them
so that the quran is easy for him and the cautious
and the fruit of the people will be roasted
for him is the drink of the fire which he will be roasted
and he will bring him forth from every side but he is a heavy liar
those who disbelieve in their lord s <unk> ’ is like a pitch of pitch darkness fallen on a pitch
they will be plunged for what they used to do
that is the high
allah created the heavens and the earth with precision
if he will he can remove you and bring you forth in your new creation
and that is not difficult for allah
the last day will come out before allah and the earth will say to those who were your followers “ are we your followers ”
they will say had allah guided us we would have guided you
now we have no strength for the one who has been patient
he will say “ i have appointed you as a friend
i had no need to you but you did not stop me
i have sought you and my hopes
so you can not help me
i am not a wrongdoer nor of you i am your wellwisher
i am indeed your lord so give me to associate with him
the wrongdoers have a painful punishment
but those who believe and do good deeds their lord will be gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding eternally therein
how excellent a parable is that of a noble messenger
the fruit of its lord
allah strikes the parables in order that they may take heed
and the evil of the earth and the like thereof is like a tree spread out and the morning
allah will confirm those who believe and in the hereafter and allah knows the wrongdoers
allah does whatever he pleases
have you not seen how allah has cursed the filth of the filth of the palmtree
they will burn in it
what an evil place to settle in it
and they hinder people from the way of allah to hinder people from the way of allah
say “ i am able to do ”
say o muhammad saw o believers who have believed give zakat and spend of that we have bestowed upon them in charity before the day of which we have provided them
who created the heavens and the earth and the mountains and the sustenance for you and the ships and the sea with it for you
and the sun and the moon each pursuing for you
and he has subjected you to be able to keep them away from allah
verily man is ever an ingrate
and when abraham said my lord
and make me forget and my gods of the idols
my lord
they have indeed fallen into many a people of stones
so whoever follows me — he will be one of the misguided
and whosoever rebels against me thou art of the beliers
my lord i have named you and my offspring
our lord
and establish prayer and give zakah and provide them with fruits so that they may be grateful
our lord
and what you hide and what we reveal
nothing is hidden from allah in the earth or in the heaven
so set in my presence a child and one who gave me sound age
my lord is the hearer of prayers
my lord
make me one of the righteous and the prayer and my lord
our lord
forgive me and my brother and my commination
and those who do wrong god is unaware of what they did
but he has not been seized by the fierce punishment
on the day when they will come out their faces will be overturned into the fire and they will come rushing to their mouths
and warn the people of the day when the wrongdoers will say ‘ our lord
give us respite till we are near to your service ”
they will say ‘ did you not swear before me
you dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves so we destroyed you and you were not aware
the wrongdoers are their own souls though their hearts were <unk>
so go away with his eyes
indeed allah has power over all things
the day when the heavens and the earth will be established in two armies
on that day people will be coupled in fetters
their faces will be covered with humiliation in flames
so he will repay each soul for its own good
indeed allah is swift at reckoning
this is a sign for mankind and for those who possess intellect
alif lam
<unk>
of the welfare
ra these are the verses of the book and the perspicuous book
and those who disbelieve would fain be turned to dust
so leave them with their shame and they will go about
and they will know
and there was a habitation that we destroyed a piercing portion
no nation can outstrip its term nor can they put it back
and the disbelievers say “ o you who have received it is indeed the truth
then why do you not bear witness to us if you are truthful
we do not send the angels except with the truth
we have indeed sent down the reminder and we will surely be the listener
we sent messengers before you
and there came not to them any one but they used to deride him
thus we have made it a taste of the hearts of the mujrimun criminals polytheists sinners etc
they were therefore presented before it and the people who were destroyed before them
had it not been for them a garden of the heavens and the earth they would have opened up their faces
the first time will say “ we are more ruined ”
and we have placed within the heaven and the earth a garment for him
and banished them from every kind of incitement
and he who steals the heads of the <unk>
and we spread out the earth and placed within it firm mountains and grew therein
and we have appointed for you and for you therein are numerous benefits
no creature is there a thing but its sources are the keepers of the birth of the known
we do not watch except according to a fixed term
and we sent the winds fertilizing to drink out of the sky and produce it as a canopy
you did not set up the living to the rear
we are the inheritor and the dead
we know the traditions of you and we were to destroy generations
verily your lord will not break them together
he is aware of all things
we created man from sounding clay of pottery
and the extended is that which they had been warned
when your lord said to the angels i am going to create a human being like the clay of clay
and when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my spirit
the angels prostrated themselves
except iblis
he refused to be among those who prostrated
he said o iblis
and what do you not prostrate to those who prostrate themselves
he said “ i am not going to prostrate myself to a mortal like you
he said begone
“ and i will increase you until the day of recompense ”
iblis said my lord
respite me till they are raised
he said “ you are among the ones that are among the liars ”
except in a proper manner
iblis said my lord
and i have gone astray from my way and i will make them enter the earth
except your hand o muhammad saw who have been granted you
he said “ this is a straight path ”
indeed nothing else is hidden from you except the <unk>
hell is their residence
and of them are some that move away for them
and verily the godfearing shall be amidst gardens and springs
enter the gates of the city and it will be said to them enter
we have turned away their hearts
sitting in ranks
they will not hear therein nor will they get out of it
and inform my servants
my endeavours is the painful punishment
so inform them of the news of the people of abraham
when they entered unto him and said peace
abraham said “ we are afraid of you ”
do not be afraid
indeed we have given you a learned of good news
he said “ do you give me good news of a child ”
what is the matter with me
they said we give you good news of good news
so do not be of those who despair
he said “ who despairs of the mercy of his lord except those who are astray ”
he said “ what is your business ”
they said “ we were sent to be sent down ”
and the family of lot
we shall deliver them all together
then we made his family one house of old
and when the messengers came unto lot
he said you are a people being tested
they said nay but we are to be afraid of what they say
we have come to you with truth and we are truthful
and keep your wife at night and follow their backs
and whoever of you wishes to go away with them and do not go away from you
we inspired him to establish the cities so that they were in the morning
and the people of the city came to him hastening
he said these are my guests
do not make me lose hope
so fear allah and do not be of the dead
they said “ did we not follow you ”
he said these are my daughters if you are bent on doing
by your side they will come near
and the morning seized them
and we caused the township upside down and rained down upon them stones of baked clay
surely in that are signs for a people who think
they are <unk> around
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
the dwellers of the thicket and the people of moses
so we took revenge on them
and the dwellers in the wood are calling to the truth
we sent our messages to them but they turned away from the path
they will be seated on the right hand
and the morning seized them
but no avail will ever touched them
we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth
it is he who forgive them in good deeds
your lord is the allcreator the allknowing
and we have given you seven years of the other
so do not let them extend your life in this world
say i am a manifest warner
so we too are waiting
so they broke their sleep into their empty discourse
by their lord we coin
about what they used to do
so turn away from the idolaters and turn away
and indeed we will recount to you against those who will come to you
who set up with allah another deity
soon they will know
we know what they say
and glorify the praises of your lord and be one of those who prostrate themselves
worship your lord until death comes to you
it is he who commands the edict of allah and he does not believe
high be allah exalted above what they associate
and allah chooses for his servants whom he wills to take his bondmen to whom he wills saying fear me and fear me
he created the heavens and the earth
high is he above all that they associate
he created man from a base fluid
and he created the twain and the twain and the twain and the twain are from them
and the beggar is for you to cause them to pasture
and they pass away many of kin
indeed he is the allclement the allmerciful
and the sons of the two gardens and the splendour which you ride
he is the most merciful you do not know
for allah is the guide of the right way
had he wished he would have guided you all
it is he who sends down water from the sky and drink
and allah causeth to grow in the grain and vines and sanctify you with it
surely in that are signs
he has subjected the night and the day to be the sun and the moon each running its course and the stars
and in that are signs for people who reflect
there is indeed a sign in that for you in the earth
and he has made the sea for you so that you may sail through it and you may be borne upon the sea
that is of allah he has given you all that is in your hearts
he has created you in the earth and made you firm mountains
and the people who were led by the means
is he equal to him who created even as he is not equal
and in this is a lesson for people who reflect
if you should disobey them
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
allah knows what you hide and what you reveal
and they are themselves created other than allah
they are not living they will not be able to do
and your creation
and those who do not believe in the hereafter are the people who deny the truth
allah knows what they hide
he is indeed the knower of those who are aware
and when it is said to them what has your lord revealed they say ‘ is this ’
so they will be able to keep on their faces and on the day of resurrection
look how evil is the burden of what they have been doing
then the roof fell down upon them and then the roof fell down upon them from the foundations
then on the day of resurrection he will say where are you being partners to allah
those who were given knowledge will say this day will be the punishment of those who disbelieve and we will give them a painful punishment
and when they have wronged themselves they will say ‘ ‘ do not wrong us ’
no
allah knows what you do
so enter the gates of hell to dwell therein forever
evil is the lodging of the restingplace
and when it is said to those who ask what has been revealed they say “ what is revealed ”
and the good result of the hereafter is better for those who do good
how excellent the abode of the godfearing
they will be in the gardens of eden beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally
thus allah rewards the muttaqun pious see v 2 2
those who are ignorant ones say peace be upon you
enter your garden
or do they come to their lord to be the first of them or do they come to guidance
likewise did those before them
allah wronged them not but they wronged themselves
the evils of their deeds assailed them and what they used to deride
they say had allah willed we would not have worshipped him nor would we have forbidden anything except what they invoked
indeed those before them did likewise
is it not a metaphor with the <unk> of the liars
and indeed we sent down to every nation a messenger proclaiming worship allah
and he hath chosen guards
travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell those who belied
and you o muhammad saw can not guide them until allah does not guide them nor will they be guided
they swear by allah their strongest oaths that allah will not resurrect any man
the dead do not be cast into the earth but most of them are transgressors
allah is the dead to raise the dead to life and that they have been lying
and we are only his saying to it “ be ”
and those who emigrated in the way of allah after they had been wronged we would surely settle in the life of this world and surely the reward of the hereafter is a great reward
they are the ones who put their trust in their lord
we sent down before you muhammad saw from the quran and ask the people of the reminder if you do not know
and we have sent down to you clear signs and we have revealed to them that haply they may be admonished
do you feel secure that allah will not cause them to swallow them or that they will not perceive
and they are enraging themselves
or are they <unk> shadows
indeed he is the allclement the allmerciful
have they not observed that allah has created harmony and incline to the right and to the left prostrating themselves
all that is in the heavens and the earth and the angels and the angels and the praise and prostrate themselves
they are eager to establish their lord s glory ’ and to be witnessed
allah will say do not wrong yourselves
it is only a single soul
so fear me
his is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
you fear other than allah
all that is with allah is the wherewithal of all that is good for you
then when the skins comes to you from allah he will cause you to lose heart
and those of you who are near your lord
that is because they used to plot
then enjoy yourselves
they have no share in what we have provided for them
by allah you will surely be questioned about what you used to invent
glory be to allah for what they dislike and what they desire
and when one of them is a child of glad tidings of a female newborn his face becomes dark and he chokes with suppressed anger
so when the wife of the bygone people may take away their hands and devour him in a dark night or is it morning
how evil is their state
for those who believe not in the hereafter is the most high
<unk>
and if allah were to take mankind away from all that they do not leave the earth to be able to destroy nor could he destroy them on a height of their appointed time nor destroy the feeding of a stated term
they have made their hearts difficult for them
and verily they will be therein for them and they will be plunged therein
by allah we sent messengers before you but he made their offspring seem decorous to them
and on that day is a result of their deeds
we have sent down to you the book that you may explain to them what they had been given to you and that they may be guided
allah sends down water from the sky and he revives the earth
surely in that are signs
and verily in this is a sign for you
and we have provided you with flesh of their meat milk which is in their bellies and a lesson for you
and you are the fruits of the palm and the vine
surely in that are signs
your lord inspired the bee saying “ have made your hives in the mountains and in the trees and in which they were devoted ”
then eat of fruits and follow the ways of your lord
there is a drink of diverse hues for men
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
then he will create you away from the best of you
allah is allknowing allpowerful
allah has made some of you superior
and do not approach the people who are bent on their behalf
then are they the ones who disbelieve in allah s signs
he has created for you from your mates and has made for you two spouses and children
do they then believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the verses of allah
and they worship besides allah that which is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth they worship nothing but allah
and nothing does he love the wealth of allah
allah knows and you do not know
allah has no power over anything with a man that has power over his own good and has a good example from us
are they equal in similitude
all praise belongs to allah but most of them do not know
allah has struck a parable there is none one of them who is a believer and he has no power over them and he who brings him back on his master
is he equal to one who does good and is one who is on a right course and is one equal to the one who is not equal to allah
and to allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth
indeed allah is over all things competent
allah has not made you hearing and sight and hearts so that you may be grateful
do they not see that they are the birds and birds
none can be alike except the <unk>
surely in that are signs for people who believe
allah has appointed for you the earth a fixed time and for you and for you in them
he has created for you in the mountains and has increased you in the earth and protect you from a place of refuge
thus allah makes his commands clear to you that you may be grateful
but if you turn away then they are only doubters
they therefore denied it while they were disbelievers
and many of them are disbelievers
and let every soul be asked to make excuses not to be excused
and the wrongdoers will not be able to give them respite
and when they see their partners they will say “ our lord these are our partners ”
but they will say “ you are indeed insane ”
on that day they will submit to allah and what they used to fabricate will forsake them
those who disbelieve and bar from the path of allah for they are the ones who disbelieved and avert from the punishment for they were causing
the day when we raise up a witness from every nation they will bring you a witness against them
and we have sent down to you the book that you may be good news and as a guidance and mercy
allah commands justice and forbid immorality and evil and forbid indecency and evil
he advises you so that you may take heed
and do not break oaths after allah has made the covenant of allah you have oaths after ratifying them
allah knows what you do
and then we set it after its strength and cast it into fragments
and allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning what you used to differ
had allah wished he could have made you one nation but he will surely be questioned about what you used to do
do not be unfaithful to your oaths that you may lead a great punishment for your own hands and bar from the way of allah and that you may be a terrible punishment
do not sell allah s covenants ’ for a small price
and if you are with allah is better for you if you only knew
and whatever good you do is with allah
they will have a recompense for what they used to do
and he has a good deed and a good deed will be repaid to the best of what they used to do
who seek refuge in allah from the devil
indeed he who puts his trust in the lord allah will not put their trust
his friend will not be able to take him as friend
and they say “ we will not send down except a little while they say allah knows best ”
nay but most of them do not know
say “ the spirit is revealed to your lord and to confirm its guidance and good news for those who believe ”
we know that some of them said “ a man of magic ”
they are diverted away from the remembrance of allah and it is they who are in clear error
those who do not believe in the signs of allah have profited them and they have a painful punishment
it is they who do not believe in the verses of allah who are the unbelievers
whoever renounces the signs of allah after having believed in allah after having been forced by compulsion
for them is a great punishment
that is because they preferred the worldly life and allah guideth the faithless
these are the ones whose hearts have become clear to allah and his messenger saw that he has made the dead
it is they who are the liars
they will be the losers
but if they do not follow their desires after they had been tempted by the creation of the prophet after they were still prone
and every soul will be recompensed for what it has earned and they will not be wronged
allah made a sanctuary of peace and a sanctuary and a place of peace and security and <unk> him in the morning and the torrent seized them in a part of the night and disgrace in the cloak of their deeds
and there came to them a messenger but they denied him so the punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers
eat of the lawful and good things allah has provided you and give thanks to him if you are truthful
he has forbidden you only carrion and blood and the flesh of swine and that which has been slaughtered and that which is in the wombs of any other than allah and that he has forbidden and he is the forgiving the merciful
and do not say ‘ this is lawful for allah ’
indeed those who invent lies against allah will not prosper
so do they expect something they have a trifling gain and a painful punishment awaits them
and we forbade you o muhammad saw which we have declared to you o muhammad saw
we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
indeed your lord is most forgiving most merciful and those who are guilty of sins and later repent thereafter will surely amend
abraham was a leader of pure faith and he was not of the idolaters
he was the thankful of allah to guide him and he guided him to a straight path
we gave him good in this world and indeed he is in the hereafter
then we revealed to you o abraham follow the creed of abraham
and was not a <unk> of those who associate others with allah in his divinity
the sabbath was decreed for the day when your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning their disputes
and make the way of your lord acceptable unto the best way
and indeed your lord is the best knower of him who strayeth and the best of those who are guided
and if any man is born of what has been sent to you
that is better for you if you are patient
and persevere
your duty is only from allah
and they will be covered with a drink for what they earned
indeed allah has already heard the virtuous and the virtuous
the <unk> he does not love the <unk> of the prophet and the <unk> which he has made the human being like to whom we have made the <unk>
he is the hearer the beholder
and we gave moses the book and wisdom and said to his children “ do you follow me ”
o descendants of israel
noah had certainly done us
and we made the children of israel in the book you said to the east and the west
and when the two armies came upon you in the city of uhud so they ran away with strength
then we aided you with help and victory over you
if you do good you do good for your own souls you will do evil
so when the angels meet their places they will be roasted in it and will cut off from every kind of fruit
it may be that your lord will have mercy on you and if we will make you a prison for the disbelievers we will surely make the blazing fire
verily this is a good news to the good news and a great reward for those who do good deeds
and those who believe not in the hereafter and seek to make a painful punishment
man is indeed like the good of his own soul
we have appointed the night and the day as two signs
and we have made the qur an a clear sign of the night and the day that you may know the number of years and the calculation of years
and we have attached to him his fate and he will be in a book
lo
this day you are commanded
and whosoever keepeth his duty to his own hurt
no bearer of burdens shall bear another s burden ’
and we command a town population revolted to destroy us and we command it to be its doer and they were doing it
how many generations have we destroyed after noah
and sufficient is your lord as a knower and beholder of the sins of his slaves
and whosoever desireth the immediate thereof he should we desire that which he desires
then we made him taste it into effect and they are in it
and whosoever desireth the hereafter shall be destroyed by the leave of him when he is driven out
we are the ones who are sincere
nor are the people of your lord mentioned
see how we have preferred some above others in this world and in the hereafter is greater in degrees and greater in preferment
do not invoke besides allah any other god or else you will be created
and your lord is the best knower of him
and if they are present at them saying do not approach them
lower your wing to them and plead my lord for forgiveness
so leave me alone with their mercy as they reared me
your lord knows what is in your hearts
if you are righteous then he is forgiving the most merciful
and give the relative his rights and the poor and the wayfarer iv do not squander wastefully
indeed satan is ungrateful to his lord
and if you should be of their lord s mercy ’ upon them you would not have opened their faces
and do not press forward to your neck nor offer it to be seen
verily your lord enlargeth the provision for whomsoever he will and stinteth it for him
he is cognisant of his victims
kill for you we will provide for them and for you
killing them is a great sin
and do not approach the dowry
lo it is a fahishah and an extravagant
do not kill the people who kill the bounds of allah
he who has turned away wrongfully wrongfully we shall forgive
verily he is helped
do not approach the child except in a manner of which you commit unless you are able to do something with your property
indeed the word of every commitment is about
and keep your houses better in respect of honor and weigh with the best outcome
and the wife of abraham
the hearing and the sight and the heart each of these will be questioned
and do not walk exultantly on the earth
you can not pierce the earth nor can you match the mountains
that is the sin of their lord
these are the verses of your lord reach you
do not invoke besides allah any other deities or else you will be thrown into hell
“ and purity is to you – from your lord
indeed you are a profound advice
we have made plain the language of corn for them but they only learn a lesson
say if they were to ask you with allah for they would have been lost
high exalted is he above all that they associate
the seven heavens and the earth and all that is between them but you do not think
he is indeed forbearing and forgiving
and when you o muhammad saw are in the hereafter we appoint a <unk> in the life of this world
we have turned away their hearts in order that you should be one of the time of their lord when they are in the hope of their lord
when they listen to you they listen and they say you are only following a man bewitched
behold how they have gone astray and have no saviors
they say when we are dead and dust shall we be dust and bones
say “ will you be able to iron ”
or lest you should bring back to you a part of the land and allah is able to do all things
they will say who will bring us back to us
say ‘ he who originated you ’
and they will shake their heads will say when will this be
say “ perhaps it is near ”
the day when allah calls you and he calls you to call you to the temple and think that you will be tested
say o muhammad saw to ibadi my words
verily shaitan satan sows discord among them
satan is indeed an open enemy
your lord is the best knower of you
if he wills he will have mercy on you
we only desire to deliver you
your lord is the knower of the heavens and the earth
and we gave the psalms and we gave david the psalms
say call upon others apart from god they can not endure it even if they have any sympathetic
and they are nearer to their lord and nearer to their hope and nearer
indeed their lord s striking ’ is severe
there is no city but that we will destroy it before the day of resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment
that is in the book
and none else except the people of the former peoples
and thamood we gave thamud the shecamel as a sign but they did not come to it except as a mixture of the warners
and recall what time we said unto thee we have made the whole city a tree and we made unto thee and we made it a tree
and we only warn them of a great sin and it is greater in numbers
and when we said to the angels prostrate before adam he said to adam i am not going to prostrate myself
he said “ so look for me i will bring myself together till the day of resurrection i will bring myself alive ”
he said go away hence for whosoever of them follows you as a payment of hell
and guard against them and wash your voice and their brethren and their <unk>
satan only desires to give them a lie
my lord has not been gracious to you
that you may be warned of the ships at sea that you may seek of your own hands
he is ever merciful to you
when an occasion of the ships reach you he will turn away from him and he will remove you away from the land for man who goes away
and do you feel secure that he will not cause you to enter the land after you had become narrow and you will find no protector against yourselves
or do you feel secure that he will turn you into the sea so that you may feel secure of the sea and then you will not find a way for yourselves
and we made the children of adam a covering them and we gave them the mountains and we provided them with a beauty of beauty
on that day when the man is <unk> with his right hand will be cut off on the left and the palm trees and the olive will be given them
and he who is blind in this world and in the hereafter will be far astray
and they would frighten you with your eyes than a little when they were to attack you
if we so willed we would have stoned you to death
then we would have made you taste a double punishment of the sky and a double punishment for us
they would still not have you but a little while they were yet little
we never sent before you any change in our line
the day when you are recited from the sun s declining of the stars and the <unk> of the recitation of the dawn
and the outstrippers
and a supererogatory devotion to you
it may be that your lord will bring you a difficulty
say my lord
make me out of the city that i may bring out of the clean land
give me a proof from your presence
and say the truth has come
indeed the listening ’ is to come
and we send down water from the quran which is healing and a healing and a mercy and it is only a loss
when we withdraw his affliction from the people when a man turns away
say he who is a right to his own good and he who is the best guided
they ask you about this
say “ i have been given you only a little ”
and if we willed we could have sent down to you o muhammad saw from our lord so that you would not find us a way against yourselves
except the mercy of your lord should be recited it
indeed the great bounty has come to you
say if the fly banded together to produce a mortal like this
and we have displayed for mankind but most people do not know
they said “ you can see a water from us
and you shall live in it gardens of date palms and vines
or do you cause the sky to fall in pieces or you cause allah to swallow the angels
or until you have a house of gold or we will bring you a book in heaven and we will be responsible for you
say glory be to him
i am but a messenger
when the people are overturned from the guidance they say “ allah has sent down a messenger ”
say if there were a earth angels to swallow them from heaven and they would not have been in the heaven
say allah suffices as a witness between me and you
he is aware of what you do
he guides whomever he wishes and shatters them for their faces and we will not find any protector against them on the day of resurrection so their faces will be the fire
that is their recompense because they disbelieved in our signs and said what when we are bones and particles of dust shall we be their bones
have they not seen that allah who created the heavens and the earth and has appointed for them a known term
and the wrongdoers are not but a little
say “ if you possessed the treasuries of my lord s mercy ’ you would be seen of them ”
we gave moses nine arguments to moses
when moses came to them they said o moses
i am an impostor
moses said you know that i have the power of the heavens and the earth and that i might test you with clear authority
expel them from the land and they were with him in the sea
then after that we said to the children of israel “ this is the day of the life of the world ”
we have sent down the truth and it was revealed
and we have sent you only as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
and we have revealed it to mankind that we may bring down the people out of it
say “ believe in it or do not believe before it came to them before the coming of the quran
and they say glory to our lord
indeed our lord s ’ promise ’ is always fulfilled
they were filled with fear of their shame and they were filled with sorrow
say call upon god or call upon the merciful
and to him belong the best names
the correct and the correct and the pure
say all praise be to god who has not taken to himself a son
and proportioned him
all praise belongs to god who has sent down the book and the balance
a warning to warn of him who fears allah and a severe punishment that is the best of good deeds
abiding therein forever
the book has been revealed to him saying allah has taken a son
they have no knowledge of it nor did their fathers
they merely make others go astray
this is a sign for them that you will not be satisfied with them
and we have appointed the earth as much as it were in the same way
and we have spread out all that is in the earth
or do you think that the most excellent of the <unk>
when the youths advanced to the cave they said “ our lord
grant us mercy from us and show us a straight path ”
so we covered them over their ears a covering
then we awakened them to know which of the two groups could reach till the time of their stay at hand
we narrate to you a message of their mouths
they were the ones who believed in their lord and we too will surely be of them the same
they will say ‘ our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth ’
we have given a mighty measure and we will give them a mighty kingdom
he said “ he is this one more – he therefore said “ this is not a fabricated chapters ”
who is more wicked than he who invents lies about god
but if you did not place them and you would have taken them instead of allah what you have taken for yourself and will extend your hands for you in the state of your lord
and when the sun rose high from their right side they were asked to go in the cave for a place of <unk>
this is the grace of allah
he is a guide like him who can not find a way
they were the ones to cry out to their base so we put them into their hearts
and if you do not turn away from them you will turn away from them and flee
and thus we made them taste of mercy from allah
a speaker among them said “ why did you not eat ”
the man said ‘ your lord knows best how long they remained a day ’
let them go out of you and let your game go on the city and let loose a way out of it
but let not let him expel you from the right way
verily they will not cease against you when they will be victorious
and thus we made the qur an to pass over them so that they may know that the hour of the disbelievers are in doubt of their hearts
their lord knows best their faith
and they said “ we will build a building over them ”
they will say “ their sixth is the eighth ” and they will say “ their sixth ”
they will say “ my lord is the eighth of them ”
say my lord knows best their number
so do not dispute with the people of the book say ‘ you have no knowledge of it ’
and no one say i will do it tomorrow
except for the one who say allah
and remember your lord when you are warned in number and say “ my lord is nearer to me ”
they remained in their cave for three hundred years and more 300
say allah knows best how long they tarried
to him belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth
how excellent a companion
there is no god except he and he does not associate anything with him
recite what has been revealed to you of your lord none can change his words
you will find no refuge other than him
and morning and evening seeking his countenance to the morning and evening seeking his countenance and do not lose hope of the life of the world and the glitter of the hereafter and who does not come to us
say “ your lord is the truth
and whosoever wills let him believe and whosoever wills let him disbelieve
we have prepared a fire for the harmdoers which will envelope them
they will be helped
what an evil resting place
as for those who believe and do good deeds we shall reward them for the reward of the righteous
these will dwell in gardens of eden with streams running in them and in them are gardens of grapes and springs
how excellent a reward and how excellent a resting place
and we have given them the parable of two kinds of two gardens of grapes and we made them bitter and we made between them green garments of birds
both of them will be in gardens and no avail to its fruit
and we will keep gush forth in their river
and he was also his party
when his companion said i am better than you
and he entered into his presence and said “ what is the matter with you ”
the life of this world is not going to come to pass away from my lord
he said “ i have made you a child of dust then from him who created you dust then from a spermdrop ”
but he is my lord and i associate not with my lord
when you entered your garden they said ‘ peace ’
to allah belongs the power of honor
if you do not force me weak
maybe my lord will give me better than your garden and will cause me to reach a garden of stones and will add strength to your strength
or its water will sink into the ground and its water will not find it any way
thus it is that the controller of its mixture
he said “ enter it and his brother and cause to enter it with your right hands and to be worshipped ”
and he had no host to help him against allah and he was helpless
and that the one s is the protection of allah he is the best of rewards and excellent is the best reward
the life of this world is as the likeness of the heaven and the earth mingleth with it and then it becomes straw
allah is able to do all things
the worldly life and the hereafter
the best reward and the righteous deeds are best in regard to your lord
and on the day when we will resurrect the mountains will see the earth and we will never resurrect them
they will say we are first before your lord and you will return to us
but you thought that we had not been appointed tryst for you
and every one of the book will be asked in it and you will see what a book s record and they will say “ woe to us ” and their lord does not have any power to do anything
and remember when we said to the angels prostrate to adam they prostrated themselves all except iblis
lo he was of the twain of thy lord s command
will you then take him and his descendants as his guardians were enemies to you
how dreadful the wrongdoers will be the pit
i did not witness them to the creation of the heavens and the earth nor do i claim to be the helpers of the creation of the creation of the creation of the heavens and the earth
the day when allah will say call on your voice
they call upon them but they will not respond to their own desires
the guilty will see the state of the fire and know that they are about to fall down before him
and we have explained in detail our verses to mankind and indeed most knowing
and when the people s guidance ’ comes from their lord and the people of the ancients come down upon them or even though their punishment should come upon them
we do not give news except as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
and those who disbelieve dispute with false arguments
they were bent on my part and they were active in my life
and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of his lord and turns away from them
we have made their hearts to swerve and we have become lost
and you o muhammad saw guide them not to the right way
and your lord is the owner of mercy for what they have done
but they will not find a place of worship for them and they will not find a refuge
that is how we destroy them for their destruction
when moses said to his servant i have cast it into the fire which was not revealed to me
so when he reached the sea he forgot the fish and became fearful of its fish and he took its way into the sea
so they went out to moses saying bring us out of our gods
indeed we have been <unk> this
he said “ when i forgot the fish when i forgot the fish rock to rock with me i forgot the fish and i forgot the fish ”
he said “ this is exactly ”
then they turned back on their footsteps
they were those whom we had given of mercy and were given wisdom and knowledge
moses said to him “ i have bestowed upon you the knowledge of the probity you have been given me ”
he said “ i do not see you are able to speak ”
indeed you are able to do anything away
he said you will find me if allah wills patient and i will not disobey you in anything
he said “ if i follow you i will not ask you about anything until you have received something of me ”
then when they came in the boat he khidr went out to the throne they had not guided
he said have you made a hole in it to drown its people
indeed the great sin is a great thing ’
he said “ i am not able to say you would not see me ”
he said “ do not make me forget and do not make me forget my task ”
so they departed until he slew him
moses said have you done that you have no right to have a boy
indeed it is a thing of evil deed
he said “ i have not been able to ask you ”
he said “ if i do not ask you anything after this then do not be of me
you are not one of the ingrates
then the two went back to the city but they declined to the people of a roasted town
it was not for them to collapse they did not find any way
he said “ if you willed you could have asked this to be a guide ”
he said “ this is agreed between me and me ”
you can not know the interpretation of what you could not encompass
so they were terrified over the ship he was frightened of them and he was afraid of them
when the boy were afraid he would have hastened to them and we made them pleasing
their lord has given them their piety in exchange that they may increase for him in purity and he is a generous lord
and as for the wall it was a wall of the two orphan boys of the two orphan and their treasure was not fluent fearing their lord that you may be righteous
they ask you about dhulqarnain
say ‘ tell me about it ’
we gave him the kingdom in the earth and we gave him the way of all things
he left the earth for his flocks
until when he reached the setting place of the sun he found it setting in a spring of which he found it setting in a black place
we said o dhu lqarneyn
and if you are to treat them with kindness
he said “ he is a <unk> with his lord and then he will be a punishment for him ”
but as for him who believes and does good deeds we will surely pay him the best reward
then he set out
until when he reached the ground he found it rising on a people for whom no sun rises or dry trampled
so look
and we remove it
then he set out for them the way
until when a one of the two armies came to pass then their words came to pass through a people who can not understand anything
they said o dhulqarnain
and spreading corruption in the land
so that we may bring you a barrier between us and them and they will be a helper ’
he said “ i am better than my lord
i will help me with a judgement between you and them
bring me ingots of iron saying bring me ingots of iron
neither cool nor <unk>
he said this is a limit of my lord but he is the biggest of it
on that day when the human will be lifted up
and when the trumpet shall be blown all together
on that day we shall raise hell into view visibly
who were laden with silver and <unk> me
and do not take me as auliya protectors helpers or helpers etc they will take me as friends
we have prepared hell for the unbelievers
say shall we inform you of the greatest losers
those who are in the life of this world including the hereafter
they are the ones who deny the signs of their lord and their arrogance are annulled
and that it is he who will tell them the day of resurrection we will bring them out of their graves
and those who disbelieve and their families and my apostles will be hellfire
and those who believe and do righteous deeds they shall be the gardens of paradise
there they will dwell therein for ever
say if the words of my lord had been mustered to the sea would have been exhausted ere it had been finished by the lips of a <unk>
say i am a human like you
my lord inspireth
and whoever hopeth for the meeting with his lord let him not associate anything with his lord
<unk>
ha mim
ya qub jacob
<unk>
sad
this is a mention of the mercy of your lord to his servant
when zakaria called out to his lord
he said my lord laden with bones
my lord enable me to be gracious
i fear that will not be saddened by the self
grant me from yourself a grace from him
“ my lord give me increase and my house ”
so make your family a gentle band
it was said to him o my people
we have given you a good name from him and we have not been a child to abraham
he said my lord
how can i reach a child when i am old age
so it was said “ this is my lord has made easy for me ”
he said my lord
appoint for me a king
he said your sign is that you will not speak to three nights
who <unk> their speech at the evening saying take away the morn of the morning
and they said o yahya john
and we inspired to moses the scripture
and we gave him wisdom and we gave him wisdom
and we gave his son and was a righteous man
and the owner of the garden was not an enemy to the east and the west
so peace be upon him the day when he is calm
when the book is set up to the east and the west a way to the onlookers
and he made a veil over them
then we sent to her people with our body and he was a man
she said “ i seek refuge in allah if you should be godfearing ”
he said i am only a mortal like you and i am to give me a pure son
she said how can i have a child when no man has touched me
so he said ‘ this is my lord
we will provide him out of his life and a mercy from us
so she brought out to the water and the caravan
and the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree
he said would that i had been before this or more
from your lord said a man who will break it into your light
and the trunk of the palmtree towards you it will drop fresh dates and ripe dates upon you
swallow up the fruits of clouds
say “ if i am loving to god i am the one the especially merciful ”
and she came unto her people with an incitement
they said o mary
and you o muhammad saw or a legal <unk> or a legal <unk> or a legal deed etc
o sister of aaron
your father was an evil man and your mother was not an unchaste woman
she said ‘ ‘ ’
they said ‘ how is it that will be ’
he said i am the one god and i am indeed a guarantor
he has given me the book and made me a messenger
blessed me wherever i may be and establish my prayer and give zakah
and he has led me astray and made me one of the righteous
peace be upon me the day i was born blind and the day i am greeted
this is the truth
glory be to him
glory be to him
when he decrees a matter he only says to it be and it is
he said “ my lord and your lord so worship him ”
so worship him
that is the straight way ”
then woe to the faithless for the scene of a tremendous day
how excellent a day they will turn in dust but the harmdoers are in manifest error
and you would see them when they are held in suspense
do they then believe
we shall gather them on the earth and their right hand
and mention in the book
he was an enemy to the human
when he said to his father father ‘ my father
why worshippest thou that which heareth not nor seeth
o my father
indeed there has come to me a knowledge of what has come to you
so follow me and i will guide you to a straight path
o my father
do not worship satan
satan was indeed an enemy to allah
o my father
i fear allah lest a punishment should touch you and you become a companion of shaitan satan
he said o my wife do you shrink away from me
if you do not desist i will surely stone you
so leave me alone for a while
abraham said peace be upon you
i will ask forgiveness for your lord
he is the subtle the merciful
i will withdraw from you and my lord
i will call on my lord when i will not be able to do
then when he had withdrawn them and his progeny we bestowed upon him from them
and we made a messenger to each of them
and we have given them of his mercy and give them a good counsel
and moses
he was a messenger and a prophet
we made moses a call to him and we made him to be near to him
and we bestowed upon him his brother harun aaron a prophet
and remember ismail ishmael
he was a messenger and a prophet
and he used to enjoin upon his family and to enjoin upon his lord s command
and mention in the book the east and the west
verily he was a man of truth and a prophet
we have made him a high place
they were the ones whom allah has bestowed upon him of the prophets from among the prophets and the descendants of israel and israel and guided to the right way
and when they are recited to them they are those who bow down to allah
and indeed their prayer is followed by a posterity
they will be exposed to their graves
except those who repent and believe and do not be among the believers
they will enter paradise and will not be a <unk>
such is the paradise of allah which he has created and the most merciful
his promise is always fulfilled
they will hear no nonsense therein except in their hearts and they will say we hear only peace
and left the garden of paradise that is the garden of delight
the angels said “ we are not but the command of your lord
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and your lord is not unaware of what is in his command
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them
so worship him and be patient
nor does he grudge to feed him
he said “ i am dead ”
does man not remember that we created him before when he was nothing
by their lord we will put them to a single living then we will gather them to the earth
then we shall turn to him in repentance the most merciful
we know well that we are the best knower of those who are nearer to belief
and whosoever will come to pass therein
that is a determined portion of your lord
then we shall deliver the wrongdoers from the fire and leave them in it they shall remain in it forever
when our signs are recited to them they say ‘ this is the best in place of grain which is better and more upright ’
how many generations we have destroyed before them who were stronger than these
say “ leave them to whom their hands have come and then they will know who is more wretched ”
allah increases in guidance those who are guided by the right way of your lord and better for recourse
and those who disbelieve say “ have i been given leave and have mercy on me ”
is he then distinguished the most merciful
nay we shall increase his torment in the heavens and the earth
and we are bound to happen to us and he will have to us
they will not help themselves besides allah
no indeed on the day of resurrection they will deny their deeds and they will be deniers of what they used to fabricate
have you not seen that the devils upon the disbelievers inciting them with evil incitement
it is he who has made haste to you
we are not occupied with them
the day when we shall gather the righteous
and drive away the guilty
and no one will have taken from other than allah
and they say allah has begotten a son
you will not commit an evil thing
so the heavens are rent asunder and the earth split asunder and the mountains fall down
they ascribe to allah a son
it does not befit allah to take a son
all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth belongs to allah
he has enumerated them and made them safe
each one of them will come to him on the day of resurrection and follow each one of them will be a lesson
and those who believe and do good works allah will appoint for them a mercy
so we made it easy in your tongue and give good news to the godwary
how many a generation we have destroyed before them
and not one of them who taketh away their lives and their backs
ta sin
ha mim
we have been sending down to you
so we made it as a reminder for those who fear allah
a revelation from him who created the earth and the heavens
allah is the <unk>
his is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
and you o muhammad peace be upon him or you will be <unk>
allah knows what is in your hearts and what is hidden
allah is ever a corrupter
and he is allah your creator
and he has best riches
and the story of moses came to you
when he fled on a fire he said “ o my people
i am not a fire
maybe i will bring you a brand therefrom or a brand of fear ”
and he said o musa moses
i am your lord
“ indeed you are of the honoured guests ”
i have chosen you so listen to what is revealed to you
lo i am allah
there is no god except me
so serve me and establish prayer and give me
they will come to know
i shall give full measure for all that is good
so let not those who have disbelieved in it and turned you away from it or you will perish
what is that in your right hand o moses
he said this is my staff and i have not been able to be able to keep the tongue of my tongue
he said o musa moses
so he threw it down and became a serpent
he said fear not
we therefore made it proper
and put your hand inside your armpit it will emerge from it
that we may show you some of our greatest signs
go to him
lo he is ever an open enemy
he said my lord expand for me
and ease my task for me
and untie the knot from my tongue
so that they may understand my speech
give me a share in my presence
harun my brother
his work is the lead of me
and make him my task
that is how you have treated with a great attainment
and remember you
indeed you are of us ever seeing
he said “ o moses your request is granted
so when a mercy from us comes to you
and that we inspired in your mother
“ and let loose it down on me and his enemy ”
and set out between them and you
and when he opened up your mother to speak to you saying ‘ shall i show you the way of the stars ’
you are a man who will forgive you and we will not appoint you as a child
you o muhammad saw stayed among the people of madyan midian and you were among the people of madyan midian
then moses came to you o musa
i have chosen you
go thou and thy brother and do not slacken in my remembrance
go to the two highways
he has indeed transgressed
and speak to him gently perhaps he may take heed or fear
they said our lord
we fear lest we should fear or be punished
he said fear not verily i am with you twain
so approach him and say ‘ we are the messengers of your lord
let the children of israel go with us and do not leave them
we have come to you with a sign from your lord
peace be upon him
it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be witnessed ”
he said who is your lord
he said our lord is he who gave everything its natural form and then guided it
he said what is the matter with me
moses said they are in a book of my lord
my lord neither prodigal nor loss
he has made for you the earth a bed for you and made for you therein gardens of water and we send down water from the sky
eat and drink
in that are signs for a people who reflect
we created you from a dust and we will not go you forth
we have certainly heard of the dead and he has not heard it
he said “ o moosa
so we said to you a man who stretches us to magic so make you stand in a place of <unk>
he said “ put my staff into the morning and the evening ”
then when the scorch turned away
moses said woe to them
or is he who invents lies against allah or does he destroy you
he who carries a burden
they dispute with one another
they said ‘ this is a good land which has been made to drive you out of their magic and they declined to be pleased with allah ’
he it is who causes the skeleton to come in ranks
today there will be a disgrace for the cautious
they said o musa moses
“ and you were the earlier dream to fall or to your family ”
he said “ you cast ”
so when the magicians came to it their ropes and their staffs were passed away
the <unk> of moses
we said “ you are indeed going to be the victors ”
cast down the shadow upon their side
they have been destroyed by the overwhelming
and he is <unk> of the <unk>
so the magicians said “ we believe in the lord of moosa and haroon ”
he said “ you have accepted faith in him before i gave you permission
he is indeed your enemy
i will cut off your hands and your feet on the trunks of datepalm trees and you will surely know whose trees is more severe and more lasting
they said shall we prefer you over the clear signs that have come to us and over the throne
so decree whatever you will
you can only make the dead to life in this world
we have believed in our lord so that he may forgive us our sins and forgive us
and the recompense of allah is better and more lasting
and whosoever comes to his lord as the result of his ownself
wherein neither sickness nor pride
and whosoever comes to him with a good deed he will surely have a depressed blissful
gardens of eden underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide eternally
such is the reward of him who purifies himself
and we said to moses go with my servants by night and strike for them and strike for you a way out of the sea
the others of his servants and he brought them out of his mercy
and weigh with them on guidance and good
o children of israel
and we had given you the right hand for you and we sent down manna and quails
eat of the good things we have provided you and transgress not in this lest my anger should fall upon you
and i am the first of those who repent and believe and do good works and then go to the right way
he said o musa moses
he said “ they are close behind me ”
i hastened to you o lord that you may be pleased
he said “ and he led them astray ”
and moses returned to his people angry and grieved
did your lord not give you a good thing
did you then not then seek refuge from your lord if you were warned you then i will not sit down on you a near punishment
they said we did not break your promise but we were laden with our eyes and we made them grow in the laden ship
they have made for them a <unk>
and we said to the children of israel “ this is what has been revealed to you ”
did they not know that no power over them nor did they harm
so he said o my people you have no other duty except the enemy
your lord is allah and follow me and obey my command
they said “ we will not stop him ”
he said o harun aaron
what stopped you when you saw them going to see
and the <unk>
and the <unk>
he said o my mother
do not grab my beard or my head
i have said “ you have divided the children of israel and have not been deficient for you ”
he said ‘ o samiri ’
he said i saw that i should cast a handful of dust and threw it down
so my brother
moses said go away for me i will be your neighbour
and for you is a punishment of punishment
and look at the sea
you have no other god besides him
he is cognisant of everything
and thus we gave you the glad tidings of the past
so they turn away from it a burden on the day of resurrection
they will abide in it for ever
on the day when the trumpet is blown and the guilty will be cast down
they will murmur among themselves you stayed not but ten days
we know best what they say when the most good among them will say you stayed not save in the life of the world
they ask you about the mountains
say my lord will break them away
and <unk>
you will neither find any cool or any loss
on that day mankind will call for one full of the caller and you will find no deviation in the presence of allah and you will hear nothing but sound
the day when intercession will be accepted from the merciful lord and the intercession will not avail except for him whose hearts are sealed
he knows what they hide and what they do not know
on that day faces will be whitened with one another and will be the breadth of the ditch
and those who do good works and are not satisfied with their own selves
thus we sent it down as an arabic quran and we have revealed it to you so that they may take heed
so exalted is allah the true king
and draw not near your bones o my lord
increase me in knowledge
we had already covenanted with the covenant but we did not find any covenant
and when we said to the angels prostrate before adam they prostrated themselves all except iblis he refused
we said o adam
and that he may remove you and so you will be not an enemy to you
you will not be able to endure it is you who are neither your heart
neither you nor suffer
he said o adam
i will direct you to a commerce that will not shake
their friends became close to them and they became exposed to their shame
thus did they find a way to his lord
then his lord made him submissive to him and guided him to a straight path
he said go down one of you enemies one of you together
but when he follows you the guidance he will find no way to me nor will anyone go astray
so whosoever turns away from my remembrance then we shall be as blind
he will say “ my lord
i have been blind to the blind so how long did you see me
he will say “ what is your opinion ”
you were going to take them away
so this day you will be forgotten
thus do we recompense the prodigal and the chastisement of the hereafter is better and more lasting
how many generations have we destroyed before them who were about to destroy generations
surely in that are signs for a people possessing understanding
and had your lord not been a tryst of the word of an appointed time
and bear patiently with what they say and thanks be before the praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and the moon so that they may be rich
and he has made for them the worldly life as to which we have given them the splendor of the life of this world
and the provision of your lord is better and more lasting
and enjoin the prayer to your family and do not be impatient
we do not ask you for sustenance
and righteousness is the best
and the disbelievers say why does he not bring us a sign from his lord
did you not see that the clear signs of allah recited to them
and had we sent them before this and they would have said our lord
why did you not send us noble messenger before we were humiliated and disgraced
say “ for them is equal
you will know who is guided and who is rightlyguided
the day when the hearts are turned away they are left in error
and when a messenger came to them from his lord they would listen to him
their hearts are <unk>
and the wrongdoers say ‘ is this not a human being like you
will you then be reminded of your eyes when you are going to be reminded
he said “ my lord knows what is in the heaven and earth ”
he is the hearer the knower
they said “ these are confused dreams ”
nay he hath brought us a play like unto which we have been sent as a messenger
so do they not believe before them which we destroyed will they then believe
we sent down nothing but to you we revealed before you
ask the people of the reminder if you do not know
we made them a food for a while they are immortal
then we fulfilled their destruction
and we saved them and those who transgress in the way of allah
and we have sent you a book
will you not then understand
how many towns we have destroyed since wrongdoers
then when they came to one of them they immediately started incitement
“ go down and be close at you ”
they said alas for us we were harmdoers
and we made them the <unk>
and we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for the twain
if we had a pastime we would have stoned it to its own accord but we would not have done it
nay but we send down the command thereof and lo it is morning and maketh it abroad
woe to you for what you describe
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and those who are near him will not worship him
they will not go out by it
or do they have taken to life in the earth aliha gods
had there been in them the heavens and the earth would have been despoiled
glory be to allah the lord of the throne high above what they describe
he will repay them for what they did
say “ are you going to bring down those who are lost
that is the right of those who have gone astray but most of them are ignorant
and we never sent any messenger before you except that i inspired in him saying worship me
and they say allah has begotten a son
glory be to him
nay but they are honoured slaves
they do not venture to feed him
he knows that which is before them and they fear him and they fear him
he said i am other than he calls to him and i will replace him with hell
thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
see they not that we created them from a earth and the water came to pass away from every kind of water
and do not take away my verses
and we have placed them firm mountains in it and we have caused gardens to grow therein in it ways and they are in it
and we made the sky a <unk>
but they turn away from the truth
he it is who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon
each one of them will be floating in acts
we did not send any messenger before you
are you not best aware of those who are immortal
every soul will taste death and try you to test
you are our lord
and when they see you they stare saying is your gods who mentions you
they are the ones who deny the remembrance of allah
man is hasty
i will not urge you to be like the destruction of my family
they say ‘ when will this promise be fulfilled if you are truthful ’
would that they could not ward off from the fire and from them a shout
they will not be able to ward off evil and they will not be able to thwart it
and those who have already told the messengers of allah that they may deride them
say who is the night and the day
but they turn away from their lord s command
or have they feet to defend themselves from us
they will not be able to help us
nay but we gave them enjoyment and their lives
have they not seen how we come to them from every kind of fruit
will they then be helped
say i am only a warner to you
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
if a breath of your lord s punishment ’ comes upon them they will say “ woe to us
we were indeed wrongdoers ’
and we shall set up the scales on the day of resurrection and none can outstrip escape
and if we do so eat of the weight of a grain of mustard seed
we have brought the like of the unbelievers
and we have made plain the remembrance for moses and aaron
who fears their lord inwardly and fear him while he is in the unseen
and this is a blessed test you deny it
and we had instructed abraham to be a way of guidance
when he said to his father and his people what is it that you worship
they said “ we found our ancestors worshiping them ”
he said “ you and your fathers have indeed been a manifest loss ”
they said are you more guiding us or are you one of the truthful
he said no
by allah you will find no means to come back after you were one of the other
so when he went away from them the city they may observe the worst of what they used to do
they said “ who is this <unk>
he is indeed one of the wrongdoers ’
he said “ the one heard a youth mentioning them ”
and say bring him back to the people of the last day
they said “ o ibrahim abraham
he said nay it is a sin for them
ask them if they can speak
they said “ you are indeed thieves ”
then they said “ you have lost their fancy ”
he said then do you take besides allah no judge
fie upon you and other than allah
so do you not understand ”
they said “ if you want to get the power of this will you be able to get it ”
we said “ o ibrahim
they were more deserving to remember but we would more likely to test them
and we saved him and all our people from the worlds
and we made him a righteous man
and we revealed to his people the guidance and we inspired them to perform the prayer and to pay the alms and they were devoted to us
and we saved him and his brother and we made him an object of good deeds
they were a wicked people
and we admitted him into our mercy
he was of the righteous
and we had enjoined upon him and his family as he was always one of the greatest losers
we made it a lie to our signs
it is he who has desired to be a evil deed we have indeed reduced them to account
and david invite to the people when they were deciding of the sheep we bore witness to their judgment and we did not be of the witnesses
and we gave him his kingdom and knowledge
and we subjected the mountains to glorify him with david and birds
and we have made it a lie
and we have made you proper for the <unk> of the <unk>
will you not give thanks
and we subjected the wind to sulaiman
“ and we carried its people by the command which we carried by the command which we carried ”
we know all things
and those who follow the way of allah and we made them leaders for him and we made them the river
and remember when he called to his lord “ and you are the most merciful of the most merciful ”
so we answered his prayer and bestowed upon him a mercy from us and we bestowed upon him his family and a mercy from him and a reminder
and remember ismail and yasa
and all of them were one of the other
and we admitted them into our mercy
they were indeed among the righteous
when they were to turn away from the way of allah we said to him “ take away your religion and you will not be a god other than you ”
glory be to you
i am one of the wrongdoers ”
so we answered his wife and his offspring
thus do we recompense the criminal
and remember when he said my lord
“ and show me the best of those who are the best of creators ”
and we accepted his prayer and we made his wife fit to bear him his wife and made him his wife for posterity
they were indeed in good deeds and they were humble themselves
and the tongue of his beloved prophet and we made her proper form of maryam mary and made him proper
indeed this religion of yours and i am your lord so worship me
but they have broken their religion among themselves all together
so whoever does good works for his striving and is arrogant
we are ever watching over it
so we destroyed their people and their companions that is more suitable for them
when they come down with their graves and they come down with a <unk>
the truth is in their sight of the eyes
they will say “ woe to us
we were heedless of this
we were wrongdoers
o you who disbelieve you and those who disbelieve are the enemies of allah
you will surely enter it
if they had been gods they would not have entered it but they will abide therein
they will not hear therein nor will they come to it
but when the hour of doom is set in store for them they are the best
they will not precede its hissing and will abide therein for ever
when the greatest terror of them will be told ‘ this is the supreme day ’
the heavens that day shall be like <unk>
so do not flaunt less than the first creation
we have been sending down
we will do it as a result of its doing
we were the ones who inherited the earth after we blessed
surely in that is a sign for those who associate others with allah
and we have sent you only as a mercy from me
say “ i am inspired to me ”
“ you are muslims ”
say “ if i turn away your message is like you
allah knows what is said and your hearts conceal
i am your plan and life
he said my lord
judge between me and the faithless
and our lord is the merciful the merciful
o mankind
be wary of your lord
it will be a very little
on the day when you will see it every nursing mother will be held in a man who will take her child but they will be unable to see the painful punishment
and there is no one who argues about allah
so whosoever takes his soul away from it he will mislead him to the path of the blaze
o mankind indeed we have created you then from a clinging clot then we created you from dust then from a clinging clot
and we appointed you as infants then you will be known
and among you are those who have gone astray
and you see the earth withered and we send down water upon it in abundance
that is because allah is the truth and he is able to revive the dead
indeed allah will resurrect those who are in the graves and in resurrection
and of mankind is he who disputeth concerning allah and his messenger muhammad saw and those who dispute about the scripture without knowledge
he is indeed <unk> of the <unk>
this is the day of resurrection we shall make it taste the punishment of the fire
he will say “ this is not for the bondmen of his earlier bondmen or by his command ”
and among the people is he who worships allah without any doubt
but if you turn away from the hereafter he will not believe in the hereafter
that is the straight way
and he does not use his wealth to cause failure
that is the high
and the riches and the loving
allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds into gardens beneath which rivers flow
indeed allah does whatever he wills
who is in this world and the next and let him expel the misery of allah and afterward they have drawn near
thus we have sent down the revelations of allah which he guides not any one to the right way
verily on the day of resurrection they will be in the grave of allah and the followers of the prophet muhammad saw and the angels will judge between them
allah is witness over everything
have you not seen that all those who are in the heavens and the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars and the moon and the trees and the trees and the last day were not alike
and whosoever is in respect of allah can not touch him
indeed allah does whatever he wills
they were two parties of their lord
and the unbelievers shall be fitted with boiling water
but they are not their supply
and they will be maces of iron
they will wish to emerge from it they wish to emerge from it and they will be asked to be “ taste the punishment of burning ”
allah will admit those who believe and do good deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow where they will be pleased with bracelets of gold and will be pleased with bracelets of gold and will be of gold and will be of silk
they are the ones whose good deeds are brought wide lovely
those who disbelieve and hinder men from the path of allah and from mankind and from the sacred mosque which will touch them and they will be equal in it
when we said to abraham ‘ do not associate with him ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ dedicate yourself to the circle around me ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’
and lower your presence in the morning they come to you from every distant place
so let them be on the benefits of allah s name ’ they pronounce the name of allah upon the cattle
so eat of them and feed the needy
then carry the house of the house
so look
and whosoever keepeth sanctities of allah it shall be better for him with his lord
lawful to you are those who are forbidden to you are lawful for you
so avoid the filth of the false people and avoid evil deeds
except him who is a child to him and can not associate anything from the sky which falls upon him or he can climb it
so look
whosoever fears the words of allah it will be a <unk>
for you is a known animal in the pilgrimage
for every nation we have appointed a ritual of god so pronounce the name of god
so give him good tidings to the humble
when they are lost in the way of allah when they are filled with fortitude and who perform assalat iqamatassalat and spend out of what we have provided them
and the camels — we have made for you
there is good for you
and arranged in rows
so when you eat of them feed the needy and the destitute traveler
thus we disposed them to your gods so that you may be grateful
their flesh and their blood is not allah but he is your sponsor
thus did we make you enter the guidance for your great destruction
and give good news to the doers of good
allah is the knower of those who believe
indeed allah does not give any ungrateful cheat
and those who disbelieve fight in the way of allah they were certainly suffered for them
they say our lord is only that they say “ allah is our lord and that he is the rich and the close ones ” and allah has kept the hidden in the name of allah and the last of the hidden
allah will help those who help him
indeed allah is the <unk> of the truthful
and if they give zakah to them the command of prostration and enjoin upon the command of prostration and forbid what is right and forbid what is wrong
and to allah belongs the end of all matters
and if they deny you before you we have already destroyed many of the people of nuh noah ad and thamud
and the people of abraham and the people of lot
and the dwellers of madyan denied before them
i respited those who disbelieved and i respited them then i will not be able to give them respite
and how many a township we have destroyed that was so we destroyed them and they were in whose dwellings plots were abandoned
have they not journeyed in the land and observed the matter of the wrongdoers
it is not the marriage that he should be blinded
they ask you to hasten the punishment of your lord but a day when the reckoning is like a thousand years of your reckoning
and how many a township did we drown them while the wrongdoers were wrongdoers
and i am but the ultimate decision
say o mankind
i am naught but a manifest warner
and those who believe and do good deeds and give provisions to him who will have forgiveness and a generous provision
and those who are the companions of hell as a fire
we never sent a messenger before you but he forgot the devil
but allah <unk> what satan casts
then allah makes his revelations plain to his slaves
allah is aware of all things
the <unk> of satan is in <unk> and <unk>
let them know that your lord has sent down the truth from him so that he is the truth and so that some hearts are ignorant
indeed allah guides those who believe to the right path
as for those who disbelieve it will come to them the hour will come upon them suddenly while they are in terror
the sovereignty on that day belongs to god and he will judge between them
and those who believed and did good deeds will be in gardens of delight
but those who disbelieved and denied our signs for them awaits a humbling chastisement
and those who emigrated in the way of allah and then died or die in the way of allah will provide them with a good provision
indeed allah is the best of providers
he will admit them to gardens with which they will abide eternally
indeed allah is knowing and forbearing
so look
and whosoever does an evil deed he will then be helped by allah
indeed allah is allforgiving allmerciful
that is the night and he merges the day into the night and he is the hearer the seer
that is the truth and allah is the supreme the grand
have you not seen how allah sends down water from the sky and the earth
allah is aware of what you do
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
verily allah is the rich
do you not see that allah has subjected to you his signs and the ships run upon the sea by his command
and he set the sky upon it by his command
indeed allah is to mankind most merciful
it is he who gives you life after death and then brings you back to life
verily man is ever ungrateful
we appointed for every nation a matter of war
and o muhammad saw call them to your lord verily you are the best of deliverers
say “ god knows what you say ”
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning what you used to differ
do you not know that allah knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
indeed this is greatly fortunate
that is easy for allah
they have no control over other than allah that which he revealed and they know not
the wrongdoers will have no saviors
and when our signs are recited to them you see the unbelievers holding them in the way of intoxication
say shall i inform you of something worse than this
that is the fire
allah has indeed made it proper
which a hapless journey s end is the fire
o mankind
and those who shun it will be carried into a while they will not create a fly even if they banded together to the place of allah
if a fly should steal away from them they could not take it back
and he inherits from it
they did not recognise god
indeed allah is the <unk> of the truthful
allah chooseth from the angels and the people
indeed allah is hearing and seeing
he knows what they hide and what they ascribe to allah
o you who believe
and prostrate yourselves before your lord and do good that you may be successful
and strive in the way of allah with your wealth
he was worthy of you and his brothers as the faith of abraham
and allah has sent down to you muslims that you may be muslims in the books before you and that you may be muslims
so maintain the prayer and give the zakat and do not obey allah
he is your companion
how excellent a reward
indeed the hypocrites are successful
who are humble in their hearts
who are the ones who are deprived of their wealth
who maintain the prayer and pay the zakat
who do not prefer their own lives
so do they have no sense of blame nor are they blamed
but as for those who disbelieve they are the transgressors
who are triumphant
who are watchful of their prayers
those are the truthful
who will inherit paradise
they will abide therein
we have created man
then we made plain in the earth a firm number
then we created out of a drop of fluid then we created in pairs after a little lump of flesh then we made it chaff
blessed is allah the best of creators
then indeed you will surely die
then on the day of resurrection he will be raised up
and we have created the heaven with you and the <unk> of the pillars
and we send down water from the sky water in it
we have neglected it
then we produce gardens of date palm trees and grapevines and whereof ye eat therein
and we have given to the tree a <unk> and a raging fire
and indeed in the cattle we have made for you a lesson for you
and for you there are other uses for you and them and also for you
and you are the inheritor
and assuredly we sent nuh unto his people and he said o my people
worship allah
you have no other god besides him
will you not then be godfearing
the unbelievers said he has been sent down to you a man like you
and if allah had willed he would have sealed up
we never heard of this
it is only he who is the one scaring so watch for it
he said my lord
help me because they deny me
so we revealed to him that he may be told ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ’
and when our command comes and the oven overflowed we shall appoint for him a barrier and those who are given the lie
and do not be my case
they are doomed to be drowned
say all praise be to allah who has delivered us from the wrongdoing lot ’
and say my lord
make me a blessed landing for you are the best of those who bring ashore
surely in that are signs
we thus take the lower life
then after them we created another generation
and we sent to them a messenger from themselves saying serve allah
will you not then be godfearing
who disbelieve the worldly life and the last of the world to come we said “ travel in the hereafter and he has led down a man of old ”
if you obey a human being like yourselves then you will be to be brought back to allah
he will bring you forth from the graves and become dust
far away wide
there is nothing but our life of this world and we live for life
this is only a man who fabricates lies against allah
we will not be surpassed
he said my lord
help me because they deny me
he said “ they are going to be remorseful ”
so we made them a <unk> wind and made them grow in a <unk>
and the people of the cities
then after them we created other generations
no nation can outstrip its term nor can they put it off
then we sent after one another
whenever they came to every community they denied him so we made them a messenger and we made them narrations
perish the fellows of the blaze
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a manifest authority
they were in the garden and they were pleased to be in a lofty garden
they said “ we have come to us as a man like the two men ”
so they impugned them and became of those who were destroyed
and we gave moses the book so that they may be guided
and we sent noah and his mother and his son on the rock and we made them a place in the earth
o messengers
eat of what is lawful and good
i am aware of what you do
indeed this is a religion and i am your lord so fear me
but they set out their own people among themselves
leave them alone for a while
or do they think that they will be given
and they are good to you
nay but they will not be able to laugh at all
verily those who tremble in fear of their lord
those who believe in the signs of their lord
and those who do not ascribe any partners to their lord
that they may be judged by their lord
these are the ones who will outstrip others in the race
and for every soul we charge not save with the truth and none can be wronged
but those who transgress beyond that for them is a sin
so when we seized their wife at once they are plunged into a new creation
“ today ”
no fear will we have given you any authority
my return is but you were wo nt to flee
and do not drive away the self causing the <unk>
do they not think about this about which there came to them a thing
or are they the messengers so they would deny it
or say he is a poet
nay but he brought the truth unto them but most of them are ignorant
and if the truth had followed their desires then the heavens and the earth would have been destroyed
but we gave them the remembrance they were given to drink
or do you ask them a reward from them
and he is the best of providers
and verily thou art upon the guidance
but those who do not believe in the hereafter are swerving away from the path
if we had mercy on them they would have found their fathers in their state
we seized them with the punishment of a sudden while they were humble to their lord
until when the punishment comes upon them suddenly they will be consumed
it is he who created for you the hearing and the eyesight and the feelings
little is the thanks you show
it is he who has created you on the earth and to him you will be returned
it is he who gives life and brings death and he increases them in the night
will you not understand
nay but they say the like of that which we have said
they said when we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we be raised again
we and our brother and were before us
naught is this but fables of the ancients
say to him “ look upon the earth and all what is on the earth ”
they will say “ god ”
say will you not remember
say who is lord of the seven heavens and lord of the earth
they will say allah
say will you not then heed
say “ keep your opinion the sovereignty of all things and all things in whose hearts is one who is able to do ”
they will say allah
say what is the matter with me
nay but we have brought the truth and they are the liars
and set not any other god along with him any authority over all other people
glory be to allah from that which they associate
he is the knower of the unseen and the seen high exalted is he above what they associate
say my lord
and if they give me respite then grant me something of protection
my lord do not cause me to be unjust
and we have certainly given you power over them
repel evil with what is better
we know well what they allege
say my lord
the devils from your instigation
my lord i seek refuge with you
until when death comes to one of them he says “ my lord
who will turn me back
you have lost the good deeds
no
there is nothing but a word that speaks to them
the day when the trumpet will be blown among them and they will come to grief
so the woe that day will be a very heavy
and as for those whose scales are light they will be the losers
the fire they will be cast into it
were you not my messages recited to you and your families
they will say our lord
you have certainly come to us and we were a people who were astray
our lord
bring us out of it
if we will we will be harmdoers
he will say peace be upon me no coolness nor jinn
verily there was a party of my slaves who would say our lord we believe
our lord forgive us and have mercy on us for you are the best of those who show mercy
but you made them forget my remembrance so that you forgot them
that day i shall drive them today and verily they are the ones who are the ones who will be the losers
allah said “ you have stayed in the earth ”
they will say ‘ a day or less than a day
then ask them where are you being
he said “ how long have you stayed ”
or do you think that the truth has come to us
allah is allhigh allgreat
there is no god except he the lord of the throne
and whosoever associates with allah another god his lord is the third of everything
the unbelievers will not prosper
say my lord forgive and have mercy
you are the best of those who show mercy
that is a chapter which we have sent down and we have sent down to you clear verses so that you may remember
the adulterer and the adulteress and the adulterer
if you believe in allah and the last day
let them witness their words
the adulterer marries neither a mushrikah nor an idolatress nor an idolatress and the adulteress save an adulterer or an adulterer or an idolater
forbidden to be the <unk> of the forbidden
those who have acknowledged their wives after they have become witness to their own souls and do not accept their testimony and they are the fasiqun the fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
then repent and save those who repent
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful
and those who do not die except themselves and leave others to be admitted by allah for four testimonies
and the fifth time that the curse of allah be upon him if he is lying
but the woman will avert her punishment by the testimony of her if she swears four times by allah s name is a liar
and the fifth time that allah s ’ promise ’ is true
and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you and his mercy
and indeed those who have passed away among you a group of you
do not regard it for you if you are good
for every man there is a sin and for him who is a sin and for him is a tremendous punishment
why should you approach this and you do not speak to the girls of the unbelievers
so they have four witnesses since they testify
then since they did not bring the witnesses they are liars in the sight of allah
and had it not been for allah s grace ’ and his mercy unto you would have been severe torment in this world and the hereafter ye would have gotten ready for what ye used to do
when you heard it and you were not but a thing that you did not know
that would be serious in the sight of allah
why did you not say it is not for us to speak
glory be to thee
this is a mighty nature
and know that allah is like you if he likes you still
thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations
allah is aware of all things
and for those who have gone forth in this world and in the hereafter is a painful punishment
allah knows and you do not know
and had it not been for the grace of allah and his mercy unto you and his mercy and he would have mercy you
o you who believe
follow not the footsteps of shaitan satan
whoever follows satan s steps ’ he commands it to be outrageous to the right way and forbid indecency
and if not for the favor of allah upon you and his mercy you would not be blamed
but allah does what he wills
allah is hearer knower
let not the affluent among you swear by allah and his apostle and the needy and the destitute
let them be their <unk>
will you not remember
allah is forgiving merciful
the tradition of the virtuous who <unk> herself from their chastity in this world and in the hereafter
for them is a great punishment
on that day their tongues and their feet will testify against them that they used to do
on that day allah will show them the right way and they will know that they are the liars
vicious women are for vicious men and vicious women
these are the ones for whom are forgiveness and a provision honourable
o you who believe
and they said peace be upon you and good not in the houses of their father
haply ye may remember
if you do not find anyone in it you will not leave it to be allowed
it is said to you “ this is more proper for you ”
and allah is allaware of what you do
and for you is no blame upon yourselves for you
allah knows what you hide and he knows what you hide
and tell the people of the city the <unk>
that is better for them
allah is aware of what they do
and tell them the women who have plotted their sights and guard their private parts and do not apprehend their husbands or their husbands or their husbands or their sons or their husbands or their husbands or their husbands or their husbands sons or their women unless they come
o you who believe turn to allah in repentance that you may succeed
and marry the unmarried among you and the woman who are upright and the male and female
and if they should be poor allah will enrich them from his bounty
allah is allembracing allknowing
let them go out to his grace till allah makes them grow in their bellies
if you fear poverty or <unk> chance to bring them out of the spoils which is good if you have any good in the cause of allah give them a good loan
and if you desire the transitory gains of this world then seek them
so whosoever makes them away from allah after that he will forgive them and will forgive them
and we have sent down to you signs and a reminder for those who fear allah
allah is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth
and the parable of his light is like a niche wherein is a lamp
and he is set within the darknesses of the stars which is <unk> within it and the olive tree or the sky
this is light upon light
and allah is allaware of what he intends
allah is aware of all things
that is the light of allah which he has made known to his name and he has become evident to him
in it they will have a share in it
men neither trade nor bargaining nor bargaining distracts from the remembrance of allah and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and spend in charity
that is because allah may repay them by his favour
he provides for whomever he wills
and the likeness of the infidels are as a mirage in likeness of a man whose likeness is as water he taketh it for him and he is the swiftest of his reckoning
or have they a <unk> of <unk>
a wave upon another wave is a king above him and one is like the other
and man would almost have acquired it
allah has not appointed light for him
have you not seen that allah is in the heavens and the earth and all that is in them
he knows what they do
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and to him is the final return
have you not seen how god sends down rain from the sky then he brings them out of the sky and quickens it out of the earth after it grows strikes them with it whomever he wills
allah maketh the day and the night
surely in that is a lesson for those who reflect
allah created every moving living creature from water
and on them are two feet that walk upon two feet
allah creates whatever he wills
allah is able to do all things
we have sent down clear verses
allah guideth whom he will
they say we believe in allah and the messenger and the messenger after that but they turn away from them
they are the ones who will be destroyed
when the two armies comes to allah and his messenger to join them they turn away from them
they come to him rushing in his presence
or do they fear that allah and his messenger will not fear their own people
nay they are the ones who will be honoured guests
the only exception of allah and his messenger and to say “ the only are in fact ”
and such are the successful
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his messenger they are the ones who will be the successful
they swear by allah if you should not leave them they would surely have been ordered to do so
say ‘ swear by the creation of allah
allah is aware of what you do
say obey allah and obey the messenger
but if you turn away know that it is only for him who has created the prayer and the matter of the hereafter
if you obey him you will be guided
the messenger s sole duty is only to convey the message
allah has promised those who believe and do good works he will make them successors in the earth and will make them successors after their fear of their own burdens
they are going to worship me
then those who disbelieve will be the losers
maintain the prayer and pay the zakat and obey the messenger so that you may receive mercy
and do not think that the unbelievers can escape on earth
their refuge shall be hell and worst indeed is that destination
o you who believe
and let your wives ask forgiveness for you and those who ask your permission before you when you have three nights before dawn
that is for you to be your striving
there is no fault in you or <unk> for you nor <unk>
thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations
allah is aware of all things
and let you leave the way of your relatives leave them alone as those before them asked permission for permission
thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations
allah is aware of all things
and do not fear for the wife of the child nor commit sin
but they are better than this
allah is hearer knower
there is no fault in you if you do not go about to houses or your brothers or your brothers or your sisters houses or your sisters houses or your sisters houses or your sisters houses or the houses of your brothers houses of your sisters houses or the
there is no fault in you on you if you eat of it or sin on you
when you enter the garden you are greeted with a greeting from allah blessed and good
thus allah expoundeth unto you his revelations so that ye may reflect
the people who believe in allah and his messenger and are needy and whose trees are not limited
and those who ask you for exemption from you and believe in allah and his messenger muhammad saw and those who believe in him
and if they ask you for your permission for them you may ask forgiveness from them and excuse them before you
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
do not make your messenger as they wrangle among you
allah knows well what you are hidden
so let the distance of the people of the city feel secure against it
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
he knows what you have done and he knows well what they do
allah knows all things
and the shade of his servants is that he has revealed
to him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he has created all things and has made a proper measure
and those who disbelieve have no power to hurt them nor hurt them in any way nor benefit
and the disbelievers said “ this is not a fabricated fabricated fabricated ”
they said “ these are the statues ” they said “ it is they who are the morning ”
say “ god has revealed it to him who knows everything in the heavens and the earth ”
he is the forgiving the merciful
they said what is this who eats food and walks in the marketplaces
why has not a man sent down to him
why do you not approach him a tree called a tree
the wrongdoers said “ you are only following a man ”
look how they have contrived to you so they are lost and can not find a way
and if you wish to live for them is better than their benefit and allah is the best of what they wish
but they deny the hour and we are about to climb it
when they see the fire they shall be cast away
and when they are flung in its place they will be thrown into a narrow space
“ today ”
say is this better or the earth
there they will have whatever they desire and there they will abide for ever
this is a noble messenger of your lord
on that day allah will gather them all together and will say “ are my supporters ”
they will say it is not for us to have a son of gold but you have forgotten us and their fathers were a hard time
they will say you have denied the truth so you will not help one another
and we shall make the wrongdoers taste a dreadful torment
and we do not eat food but any food that he eats food
and we have appointed for you the angels
your lord is seeing
they said why do we not see our angels who can outstrip us
they had been given the thought and were a great thought
the day when they will see the angels will say “ there is no good news of the guilty ”
we remove them in their misdeeds
for those who have gone forth on that day will be better and better resting place
the heavens and the earth
the day the judgement belongs to god that day the unbelievers will be exclusively for the idolaters
so the day when the wrongdoer will bite in his hand he will say ‘ i wish i had taken my tongue
woe to me
would that they could take the guards of hell
indeed he has been given me respite ’
satan is indeed an enemy to man
and the messenger muhammad saw said my lord
and he used to worship the idols
thus we have made an apostle a prophet for every nation as an indication
and they say why has a man not been sent down to him who has been on the earth
and we have revealed it to you and we have sent it down for you the best of moral things
they said “ we bring you a good news in which we have not brought to you and we are the best of rewards ”
those who will be roasted into hell it is they who are the worst in error
we gave moses the book and appointed his brother aaron as a minister
and we said go to them “ go to the people who have denied our signs ”
then we destroyed the people who were a wicked
and when we drowned the people of noah they impugned the apostles and a lesson for mankind
we have prepared a painful punishment for the wrongdoers
and ad and thamud and many a generation we destroyed
we destroyed them all together
and they are in the morning of the poor that are in ruins
will they then not consider it
nay they have not seen it
and when they see you they say enough for you is allah s help and that anyone who does not reveal to you
if we had so willed we would have been among them
and when they see the punishment they were to go astray and they were further astray
and who is more astray than he who wishes
you are not responsible for it
or do they think that most of them would not hear or understand
they are even worse in error
have you not seen how your lord lengthens out the shadow and then determined it
then he turned to us in repentance
and it is he who has made the night for you and the day to rest
it is he who sends the winds as glad tidings ahead of his mercy and we send down from the sky water rain
how many a creature that have been laden with which we have created
and we have made it a sign for them but most of them do not accept
if we willed we could have sealed up
so bear with patience and do not compel them this is a great deal
and it is he who has made the two seas a means of water flow one palatable and sweet and bitter and he has set a barrier between them
and he it is who has created for him out of his kind and has created all things
they worship besides allah that which they worship not for them nor do they harm
the faithless are wicked against his lord
we have sent you only as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner
say “ i do not ask you any recompense from you for it is only a way to your lord ”
and put your trust in the eternal punishment
he is the knower of his bondmen
he created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he placed between them in six days
he is allah the most merciful
ask allah of this
and when it is said to them “ prostrate to allah ” they say “ what is the most merciful
will you not prostrate to what is before us
and it increaseth in their exorbitance
and the houses of the heavens and the earth he set in it a lamp and he has made it a light
and he it is who hath created the alternation of night and day and maketh day to be thankful
the true believers are in the way of allah they walk on the earth and they say peace be upon the ignorant
they will have their lord s heat and their lives
they will say our lord
the chastisement of hell will be realized against us
indeed hell is an evil restingplace ’
and those who when they spend are neither prodigal nor miserly between that is between them
they have taken besides allah who has forbidden nothing for the sake of allah and who has forbidden except such as are killed
multiplied for him is the result of his deeds and on the day of resurrection
except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds allah will change their deeds
allah is forgiving merciful
and whosoever repenteth and worketh righteously verily he is of those who are obedient to allah
and they will not listen to it
when it is read out the signs of your lord fall down upon them
they will say our lord
grant us the offspring of the child and the offspring of the righteous
in it they will be <unk> with a greeting of peace and security
they will abide therein
how excellent a restingplace
say “ my lord has made the truth come to you
so we forgave you
ta sin
sin qaf
aliflaammeem
ra these are verses of the wise book
so that you may not grieve for their sake of their disbelief
we have sent down from heaven a rain that they could not feel secure
there does not come to them any sign from allah but they turn away from it
who are the verses of the bygone to them except those who have acquainted with their own eyes
or have they made to grow in the earth
surely in that is a sign but most of them do not know
nay but he is the merciful
and when your lord called moses a people who did wrong
and came to you
they will say ‘ ’
he said my lord
i fear that they will deny me
and that i may be inspired to you so that you may be divided
they will have a share of fire for it so i fear they will be able to keep me ’
he said nay
go to them and to go in adhering
we were definitely with all things
go ye twain unto him and say we are the messengers of the lord of the worlds
allow us to allow the children of israel ”
he said ‘ i will devise you in folly
you are the ones who are deeply engrossed in us
thou art an evil man and thy tongue
he said “ i have obtained it
i seek refuge from you but my lord has made me a son of my mother and rebuke me
he has fed the children of israel ”
he said “ and what is the lord of the worlds ”
moses said if you have faith in the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you should be believers
he said “ what is the matter with you ”
he said your lord and the lord of your fathers the ancients
he said “ i will give you a noble messenger ”
he said “ and all that is between them if you are believers ”
he said “ if you do not see me i will call you ”
moses said what is your opinion
he said “ then if you are truthful ”
so he turned away and flung down his staff
and he has become a <unk> <unk>
and the city said “ this is a skilled magician ”
who seeks to expel you from his magic
so be you yourselves neither <unk> nor <unk>
they said “ send him forth and send him forth for a while
to bring you every expert magician ’
so the magicians were assembled at a time of a known day
and it was said to the people “ you yourselves are not thieves ”
if they follow their upper hand we will follow them
so the magicians said “ when they are removed from us will be victorious ”
he said “ yes i will surely give you good intentions ”
moses said to them cast you first
so they threw down their ropes and their sticks and said by the means of the stars we will surely be victorious
then he cast down his staff and that which they had invented
the magicians fell down in prostration
they said “ we believe in the lord of the worlds ”
the lord of moses and aaron
he said have you come to him before i gave you permission
he is indeed your enemy
then you will know
i will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and i will crucify you all
they said “ we will indeed do so ”
we are the first of the muslims
we revealed to moses ‘ travel by night for you are indeed going to be pursued ’
then the cities sent down to the cities
he said “ these are a small band
they said “ our lord
we will care for us ”
and we caused them to grow in the tree and the tree of the wicked
and treasures and good deeds
thus we made the children of israel inherit the eastern
the sun s wife ’ seized them
and the two groups came to the people of moses they said we are sons of moses
moses said no
my lord is straight with me
we revealed to moses ‘ strike the sea ’
and every one of them went back to it its sister water and a way
and he plunged in it
and we saved moses and those with him all together
and we drowned the rest of the stars
surely in that is a sign but most of them are not believers
indeed your lord is the allclement
and recite to them the story of abraham
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
they said we worship idols and we are ever devoted to them
he said ‘ ‘ ‘ do you come to know ’
or do they benefit you or harm
they said nay but we found our fathers doing so
he said “ what you worship ”
and you also also will be able to call out of life
but i fear the lord of all the worlds
who has created me and made me a straight path
who has created me and made me proper
who when i am <unk> of the birth of the birth of death
who then will cause me to die and then will cause me to die
who has taken the measure and the balance
my lord
give me and join me with the righteous
then we said to me a good name among posterity
and grant me the inheritors of the garden of delight
and forgive my father
he is indeed deprived
and do not disgrace me on the day when they will be raised
the day when neither wealth nor children will avail
except a big believer that comes to him
and paradise is brought near to the pious
and hell will be brought near to the perverse
and it will be said to them “ where are your partners ”
and seek refuge in allah
are they then unable to help you or are they returned to your lord
then they will roast in the fire
and and the hosts of iblis
they will be in it forever
by allah we were indeed in manifest error
when we have delivered you from the lord of the worlds
no one misled us except the sinners
now
nor have we any sympathetic friend
so they will not return
surely in that is a sign but most of them do not believe
indeed your lord is the allclement
the people of noah denied the truth
when their brother noah said to them will you not fear
i am a source of vegetation for you
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no wage of you my wage is with the lord of the worlds
so fear allah and obey me
they said “ we follow you ”
he said “ what do i know not
they could not have lain my account
i am not a trustworthy messenger to those who believe
i am only a clear warner ”
they said o noah if you cease not surely i will surely be one of the expelled
he said my lord
my people have branded me a liar
judge between them and me and my family except me with the unjust ”
so we saved him and those with him in the laden ship
and we drowned the rest of the earth
surely in that is a sign but most of them do not believe
indeed your lord is the allclement
ad also denied the messengers
when their brother hud said to them will you not fear
i am your god a generous trial
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no wage of you my wage is with the lord of the worlds
and you have drawn away from every parting
as if you will be immortal
when a hot water falls up
so fear allah and obey me
and have fear of the good things which you have earned
he gave you flocks and sons
and with springs
i fear the punishment of a great day for you ”
they said “ it is a reminder for us whether you admonish us or is a child ”
and it is naught but the reminder of the men of old
we are not going to be punished
so they denied him so we destroyed them
surely in that is a sign but most of them do not believe
indeed your lord is the allclement
thamood rejected the messengers
when their brother salih said to them will you not fear
i am your honest messenger
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no wage of you my wage is with the lord of the worlds
will you then stay here
amidst gardens and springs
and green crops fields etc and <unk>
and you carve out dwellings
so fear allah and obey me
and do not follow the mischiefmakers
they were the earth and they were arrogant
they said you are only a mortal like it
you are nothing but a man like us
so bring us a straight path ’
he said ‘ this is a skilled sorcerer
and there is a day you drink and you will drink on a day when your drink will be told
and touch her not with harm lest the punishment of a great day seizes you
they were overwhelmed by the wind and they became regretful
so the punishment overtook them
surely in that is a sign but most of them do not believe
indeed your lord is the allclement
the people of lot rejected the messengers
when their brother lot said to them will you not fear
i am a source of vegetation for you
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no wage of you my wage is with the lord of the worlds
you are only one nation in exchange of another
leaving the consorts your lord has created for you
you are indeed a transgressing lot ’
they said o lut if you do not desist you will be one of the expelled
he said i am your <unk>
my lord
deliver me and my family from what they say
and we saved him and his family all
so do not follow one another except the righteous
then we destroyed the rest of the two
we poured down upon them a rain of stones
how dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned
surely in that is a sign but most of them do not believe
indeed your lord is the allclement
the dwellers of the wood and the people of tubba
then he said will you not fear
i am your honest messenger
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no wage of you my wage is with the lord of the worlds
and do not keep your duty to allah
weigh with an even balance
and do not drive away the earth spreading out
and fear him who created you and the generations of old
they said you are only a mortal like it
you are only a test for us
then bring down upon us lumps from heaven if you are truthful
he said my lord knows best what you do
they denied him so the punishment of the day of resurrection seized them
it was indeed a mighty day
surely in that is a sign but most of them do not believe
indeed your lord is the allclement
indeed this is a revelation from the lord of the worlds
which the spirit has brought down
you are one of those who are of those who are of the unaware
this is a revelation that has been revealed
indeed he is of the former generations
is it not a sign for the children of israel
had we sent it down on a clear book
and he had not believed it
thus do we recompense the hearts of the guilty
they will not believe in it
it will come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
they will say “ we will be given respite ”
do you hasten on our punishment
if you had not seen the way of the people of the desert would have come to them
then they were afflicted by that which they were wo nt to come to pass
there is none to touch them except that they used to deride
we did not destroy any town except that it may be warners
and we did not warn a people for the wrongdoing lot
and the devils fell down
they are not able to hide their selves and they are unable to do it
they are in an prone to listen
and he it is who setteth up with allah another god lest you be of those who are punished
and warn your nearest kinsmen
and lower your wing to the humble
and if they disobey you then say verily i am innocent of what you do
put your trust in the compassionate
and who observes you when you rise up
and the sun and the moon
he is the hearer the knower
shall i inform you on whom the devils descend
they descend on every sinful liar
and most of them are ignorant
but as for the poets do not follow them except the deviators
have you not seen how they are guided
and say what is the matter with us
but those who believe and practice the remembrance of god and then remember god frequently
and verily the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc will know
ta sin
sin qaf
these are the verses of the clear book
the guidance and the balance
who establish prayer and pay zakah and are certain of the hereafter
it is he who made their works seem fair to them and they did not make mischief in the earth
these are they the worst losers
lo thou art able to add the truth and <unk>
and when moses said to his people i am a fire
so let them look to you from it a warm yourselves
and he came to it and said “ peace be upon him ”
glory be to god the lord of the worlds
o musa moses
i am allah
and throw down your staff
but when he saw it quivering like a serpent he turned about and turned about in his way he said o moses
do not fear the messengers when they are full of fear
except for him who does not wrong himself and then i am of the doers of good
and put your hand inside your shirt
that is indeed a transgressing lot ’
their baggage said “ this is obvious magic ”
so they disbelieved in the hereafter
behold what wise hath been the end of the corrupters
and we gave david and solomon they said praise be to allah who has preferred us over his servants
and sulaiman inherited from daud
we have been taught the language of birds and we are the <unk>
indeed this is a manifest test
then the jinn were abased among the jinns and men they were <unk>
until when they reached the valley of the ants an ant said o ants
enter the gate and his hosts and they will not be subdued
he said “ my lord give me respite and be grateful to me and to your family and to set me among the descendants of your family and to give me a good deed ”
he said ‘ do you see what is it you who used to do ’
he will punish me or i am a clear punishment
he said i have not comprehended what you have comprehended me and i have not grasped you in sheba with sure knowledge
i am a man of everything and isaac and a great throne
i do not prostrate to the sun of allah and his people to the sun and the moon seem fair to him and satan does not guide them to the right way
he has made known that which is in the heavens and the earth and that which is in your hearts and that which you reveal and that which you reveal
allah la ilaha illa huwa none has the right to be worshipped but he the lord of the supreme throne
he said “ you have now looked or are you one of the truthful ”
go to my father and then he brought it back to them and see what they return
he said o my people
i am a <unk> of action
it is from the merciful lord
and do not be haughty with me and as muslims
he said o my people
this is a proper matter
i have no desire to be done to me
they said “ we are able to create a great warriors and the greatness of the great might ”
the queen of every animal they will go to it and they will be <unk> therein
so look they tasted the gravity of the fire
i am going to send a gift and to see what the envoys came
and when the messengers came to him he said would you help me
and that which allah has given me is better
you only are called out to your own aid
and they come to you with a winnowing
we shall drive them on a height of flames and they will come out of it
he said “ o my people
who bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering
the sprites said “ i have stoned you to your vision ”
i am strong and reliable ”
but as for him who had been told i am but a hearer of hearing
and he entered the tablets when he saw it he said ‘ this is by my lord s ’ enemy ’ or do not give me a loss ’
and whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for his own sake and whosoever is ungrateful only to his own loss verily my lord is the independent of the thankful
he said “ we will now believe in it and stand with the same way ”
so when she arrived she was asked is your throne like this
he said “ he is the one who has been deprived ”
he said we have been given knowledge before it and we were muslims
he was a group of the faithless lot ’
the father said “ enter ”
and when the trumpet is blown him
he said “ this is a hall ”
she said my lord
i have wronged myself
so follow the lord of the worlds
and to thamood we sent their brother salih saleh to serve allah
but they are two parties
he said o my people
why do you hasten evil rather than good
why do you seek the way of allah that you may receive mercy
they said we will keep your duty to you and those with you who are with you
he said your augury is with allah
you are an enemy like brothers
and in the city there were some who spread corruption in the land
they said “ swear by god with his own oaths and his family and his family we will be the same to him ”
they devised their guile but they did not perceive it
so see what was the end of their scheming
we have destroyed them with the <unk>
that is the morning of the morning and the scale
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
and we saved those who believed and feared allah
and remember when he said to his people “ do you see yourselves
do you approach men instead of women
nay but ye are froward folk
but the only answer of his people was only that they said ‘ the wife of lot are not one who wishes ’
and we saved him and his family except his wife we made him to be of the late ones
we poured down upon them a rain of stones
how dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned
say praise belongs to god
or have he better or is he pleased with him
who created the heavens and the earth and sends down water from the sky and thereby we cause the earth to grow in it
you are not going to deprive them
no any god along with god
and he placed the earth in it firm mountains and has caused rivers to flow in which he has placed within them a barrier
there is no god other than god
nay but most of them know not
and who when he calls you to the call of allah and who made you successors in the land and the sea
there is no god other than god
how little do you reflect
so who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings and his mercy to you
there is no god other than god
high is allah above all that they associate
who then it is who provides you sustenance from the sky and the earth
and there is no god besides allah
say bring your proof if you are truthful
say o muhammad saw none in the heavens and the earth will be able to know who knows the unseen nor will they be raised to life
and do they comprehend
so they are in doubt about it
they say ‘ will we not follow our forefathers ’
we and our brother and were before us
this is nothing but a habit of the <unk> ”
say “ travel over the earth and see what sort of fate befell the guilty ”
so do not grieve for what they were warned
they say ‘ when will this promise be fulfilled if you are truthful ’
say “ hands have you considered a boy ”
indeed your lord is gracious towards mankind but most of them do not know
indeed your lord knows what they hide and what they reveal
there is nothing in the heaven and earth but is written in a manifest book
this is indeed a great many of the children of israel most of what they differ
it is indeed a guidance and a way
indeed your lord is knowing of what is within their hearts
so put your trust in allah for you are upon the manifest truth
and if you can not make the dead to hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they are driven back
you can not guide the blind out of guidance
you can not make the deaf to hear except those who have submitted themselves to our signs
when the word of allah comes upon them from a place of safety for them they will be spared that when they were certain of their faith
on the day when every nation shall be summoned to a troop of those who rejected our signs and they shall be restrained
when you come to know them saying ‘ why do you not act them ’
the wrongdoers will utter humiliation for what they used to fabricate
have they not seen how we have made the night to swallow the day to be its appointed time and we have made the day to be a garment
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and the day when the trumpet will be blown all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth will be placed before him
and you will see the mountains being like the passing away while they are in the state of allah
he is indeed well aware of what you do
and whosoever bringeth a good deed is better than he who has a heavy day when they are in despair
and if evil befalls them they will be recompensed except for what you used to earn
say “ my lord has commanded me to worship him and he has forbidden it ”
to him belongs all that is in my order that you are commanded
and will be <unk>
and whosoever goeth right only goeth right and whosoever goes astray say i am only a man who is rightly guided to the truth
say “ all praise be to god and his messenger will you show them
and your lord is not unaware of what you do
ta sin
sin qaf
aliflaammeem
these are the verses of the clear book
we have indeed brought to you a sign
indeed it is he who left their lives in the earth and did not make mischief in the land
from them he leaves wealth and children
verily he was of the mufsidun mischiefmakers
we shall grant them the mercy from their presence and make them easy
and give them from their <unk> in the earth and that they may show them what they had enjoined
we said to the water of moses suckle him and cast him into the river
do not fear nor grieve
we will make him taste it and we will command him to you
and they took it as an enemy and the wolf may come upon them
and they were <unk> of <unk>
he said “ this is for me and for yourself
do not kill him
maybe he will benefit us or we may adopt him as a son ”
they were wo nt to laugh
and we have not made the earth a wife for it except a little
his mother said go to him
and that it is a delight to musa moses
we had enjoined upon him before and he said to his sister “ charge of what is behind you and set up a household for you ”
so we restored him to his mother that she may be content and that she may know that allah is the truth
but most of them do not know
and when he reached his maturity we bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge
thus do we reward the doers of good
and he entered the city and the people of the city which were found therein and the people thereof and the two men fighting
then he who would have assaulted him
he said “ this is an evil man ”
he said “ he is in manifest error ”
he said my lord
i have wronged myself
forgive me
and he has forgiven it
he is the forgiving the merciful
he said my lord
i am going to appoint a measure when i have reached the oppressors
and he who is left behind in it and is further <unk>
moses said you are indeed one of the misguided
and moses said to his family “ o my people
hast thou slain me as thou didst kill me
you are not a tyrant in the land and you are not one of those who are ignorant
and the seeker one of his people said o musa moses
and he would bring you forth
go and away
i am of your family that will be one of the distressed
so moses went forth from thence saying my lord
deliver me from the wrongdoing lot ’
he said “ perhaps my lord will guide me ”
and he came to the water of madyan a star of the hot water
and he was told to his two women what is your business
they said “ we can not know the city ”
then he said my lord
and he is sent down to me a wellversed sorcerer
then a man came to him saying ‘ father for a child that can not appoint you a garden for me ’
so when he came to him he said fear not
and you o people of the evildoers
he said o my father
and he who proclaims it the secret plan and is the strong the strong
he said “ i will try to deal with you in my belly for you
if you do not ask me for this i will be a hard child to you
allah cleared me and i will crucify you
moses said this is a <unk>
and allah will give me victory over the two ends of the two days
so when moses completed his term he completed it with his household he said to the fire “ put me to fire ”
i am not a fire
i bring you news from it or a brand of yours ”
then he entered the fire when he was called from the right side of the valley in the tree called out o musa moses
i am allah the lord of the worlds
and throw down your staff
and he turned about it he said to his people o moses
and fear not near
and thou art of the <unk>
and put your hand inside your shirt
and he who produces the hands of his own hands and became full counting
this is a sign from your lord and his messenger
they are indeed a transgressing lot ’
he said my lord
i fear that they will kill me
my brother aaron is more eloquent than me
so do you leave him with me as a helper
i fear that they will deny me
he said “ we will give you authority over them and will not touch you with anything of your deeds ”
you will follow your followers and you will be the victors
so when he came to them with clear signs they said this is nothing but magic
we do not say of this magic
moses said my lord knows best who is the guidance and the abode of the hereafter
the wrongdoers will not prosper
he said “ o my people i am a source of ease
and i have not reached the mount sinai
i am indeed one of those who deny it
and his pride and his family wrongfully wrongfully wrongfully and the earth wrongfully and thought that they would never be brought back to us
so we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea
so see what was the end of the wrongdoers
we made them leaders and they will not be helped
and we made them taste disgrace in this life and they will be made to go on the day of resurrection
and we destroyed moses with the earlier generations and we gave moses the book that they may remember
we had fixed moses with the commandment and you were not among the witnesses
and how many generations have we produced long for long while they were not aware
and we will surely make them a way for the people who would not believe our signs but we are to be senders
and we were not with moosa before you but you were a herald of warning before you that you may warn a mercy from your lord so that you may warn a people who have gone before you
so when they are afflicted with misfortune they will be afflicted with humility
why should we not follow you until we have followed you
and when the truth came to them from us they said “ what is to be given to moosa ”
did they not disbelieve in what was more powerful to moses
they said ‘ do you come to one another ’
say bring a book from allah if i should be truthful
if they follow their desires follow you they will follow their desires
and who is more guided than one who follows his own lusts
allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
so we revealed to them
and those to whom we gave the book before them
when it is recited to them they say we believe in it
verily it is the truth from our lord
we were even before it
they are the ones who have earned their wealth and their commerce because we have provided them with good things and spend in the way of allah
and when they hear they withdraw therefrom and say our deeds are your deeds and your deeds
peace be upon you
we are not like the decayed
you can not guide whomever you will but god guides whomever he wills
he is the best knower of him who is guided
the faithless say ‘ if we should be rightly guided ’
have we not established them a sanctuary secure from which we have created in the earth
but most of them do not know
how many a city we have destroyed
and they did not create it for them other than they
and we were the inheritors
and thy lord would not destroy till he came unto them a <unk> chapter 19
and we destroyed not the cities except in the cities
whatever you are given is only the wares of the life of this world and the hereafter and the best of abodes is better and more lasting
will you not then understand
is he whom we have promised a good promise which he is given the like of worldly life and then he is equal to the extent of the life of the world
on the day when he will call them and he will say where are my partners
they will say “ our lord
these are our <unk>
then we made them as they were plunged into error
we have turned away from them they were serving
and it will be said call upon your socalled partners of allah
they will call them but they will not respond to them and they will see the punishment
it is they who are the best of their own conduct
the day he will call them and say what can you see
the day they will not come out anything of what they concealed
but he who repents and believes and does good deeds he will be successful
your lord creates whatever he wills and restricts it
but they will not go astray
glory be to allah above that they associate
your lord knows what they hide and what they reveal
he is allah there is no god but he
all praise belongs to him in this world and in the hereafter and to him you will be returned
say have you considered if allah should cause the night to enter into rest then for you until the day of resurrection which you rest
will you then not remember
say tell me if allah should bring you night for rest then rest the day of resurrection
will you then not perceive
he has appointed for you the night and the day that you may seek his bounty and that you may be grateful
on the day when he will call them and say where are my associates whom you used to do
we shall bring out from every nation a witness and say produce your evidence
they will know that the truth is with allah alone and all that they used to fabricate
but we delivered them a sorrow when they were seeking to draw a heavy rain upon him
he said “ my people
verily allah is the rich
so do not consider god s promise ’ with you and do not forget your efforts as the earth you are corrupt in the land and do not corrupt in the way of god
he said “ what is that i should be given to me ”
did he not know that allah has increased in power and riches and children
the guilty will not be questioned about what they used to do
then he caused his people to descend into the sea
he said would that we had plenteous
he is indeed the owner of great fortune
but those who were given knowledge said woe to you
but those who believe and do good deeds are better for them
we cast him down to the sea
and that he had helped him against allah
and those who had wished that he should have said to his parents “ he increases himself in the way of his own hands ” and he will say “ what is in your hands own ”
had allah not been gracious to us he would have caused us to swallow us
the unbelievers will prosper
we shall try to cause corruption on earth and cause corruption in the land and to spread corruption
the sequel is for the cautious
and whosoever worketh an evil deed shall be requited for it and he who does evil deeds shall bear the consequence of what they did
o dear prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him who has been revealed to you will surely bring you back into the fire
say my lord knows who is in a manifest error
it is the revelation of the book that you should know that it is revealed to you from your lord so do not be one of those who disbelieve
so judge thou not with the revelations of allah after they come to thee and be thou not of the idolaters
and set not up with allah another god
there is no deity except him
so they will have all that they desire
his is the sovereignty and to him you will be returned
alif lam
<unk>
aliflaammeem
and they think that they will say “ we have thought that we have indeed tested ”
we are the ones who asks them
and allah will surely know the truthful ones and the liars
nay but they are not going to find a way
they will be plunged over themselves
so let him who hopes to meet allah let him know that he is the hearer the knower
he who fears his soul
no god is the owner of the worlds
and those who believe and do good deeds will be better than the pious
we have given you a good portion of the man that you do not ask me for what has been given you
i will tell you of what you were doing
as for those who believe and do good works
and among mankind are those who say “ allah is not believers ” but the people are not equal in allah s cause
and if a party of your lord is the truth say will we not be able to do we not know
allah will surely make evident those who believe and he will expose them what they used to wrong
they say ‘ we will go to your iniquities ’
and it is not for them to ask
they are liars
and they have not made their wives nor their own brethren and their own selves and they will be questioned about their voice
we sent noah to his people but he remained a little enjoyment for a while
so we saved him and those who were in the ship and made it a lesson for all the nations
and abraham and departed
when he said to his people worship god and fear him that is better for you if you but knew
you worship besides allah and you do not worship idols
verily those whom ye worship instead of allah have no power over you
so worship him and be dutiful to him and serve him and be grateful to him
but if you deny him and your deeds have come to you
so give the messenger s sole scriptures
have they not seen how allah has created them then he turned them into creation
indeed that is easy for allah
say travel in the land and see how god brings the dead
allah is able to do all things
he forgiveth whom he please and showeth him the way he will and you will be returned
neither the earth nor the help of allah you have neither any protector nor helper
those are they who deny the signs of allah and disbelieve in him
there is a painful punishment for them
but the only say slay him or slay him
but allah saved him from the fire
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
he said you have taken idols for worship instead of allah
then on the day of resurrection you shall be foremost
and those who will be able to help you
but he believed him
he said i am ordered to go to the path of my lord
lo he is of the <unk>
we gave him the book and his offspring in this world and we gave him the book and the hereafter he will be among the righteous
and remember when we said to his people
when he said to his people ‘ you commit an indecency for you
you commit indecency and dishonour for the good things
but only that the only say bring us the punishment of allah if you are truthful
he said my lord
help me against the people who do corruption
and when our messengers came to abraham with the good news they said verily this is a furnace
he said “ lot is there ”
they said we know who is best aware of it
we will surely deliver him and his family
except for he who is among those who stay behind
so when our messengers came to lot he said to them do not fear and do not grieve for your companion
we shall punish the sinners for that which they have earned
and verily we have appointed for mankind a manifest warranty
and to midian we sent their brother shu aib
he said o my people
worship allah in the last day and do not cause corruption in the earth
so they denied him so they became filled with a people of the inner guests
and ad and thamud people
this is their promise
satan made them seem fair to them and they were the people of the pit they were living
and the tribe of thamud and the outcast
and indeed moses brought clear signs to them and they were in the land and they would have been returned to us
so we sent against every one of them his wife laden with water and we seized them with a severe punishment
it was not allah who wronged them but they wronged themselves
the likeness of those who take away from among you is as a <unk> of the spider who taketh away the ka bah at makkah and the takes of the cattle if they but knew
allah knows what they say
<unk>
we make these parables for mankind but none understands them but the people do not know
he created the heavens and the earth with reason
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
and establish the prayer
indeed you establish the prayer and the beloved of allah is the most high
and allah is allaware of what you do
and do the people of the book say to the people of the book and your lord we believe in him and in what has been revealed to you and we obey you
thus we have sent down to you the book and the believers
and among them are those who believe in it
nor did you come with any book before nor were you writing
nay but the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc are in plain
they said why has not a man sent down to him from his lord
say “ i am but a plain messenger ”
it is not for them to bring down the book that is recited to you
surely in that is a mercy and a lesson for those who believe
say allah suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in allah they are the losers
they ask you to hasten the punishment
had we wished we would have punished them
it will come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
they ask you to hasten the punishment on the day of resurrection
on the day when the punishment will envelop them and he will say to them “ taste the consequence of their deeds ” and he will say “ taste what you used to do ”
o you who are <unk>
this is my favour
so worship me alone
every soul will know what it has done
then to us you will be returned
and those who believe and do good works shall be admitted into gardens beneath which rivers flow
they will abide therein
how excellent is the reward of the workers
those who put their trust in their lord and in him they trust
and many a generation have we sent down to his slaves who reflect not
allah is the hearer of you and he is the allhearer allknower
he is the hearer the knower
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth and the moon they will say allah
where are they being diverted
allah enlargeth the provision for whom he will and straiteneth it for whom he will
allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and if you ask them who sent down water from the sky then they will say ‘ who is allah ’
say all praise be to allah
but most of them do not understand
the life of this world is nothing but a sport and a pastime
and the home of the hereafter is surely the greatest
when they embark in the ships they sail at sea as though he has ordered them to be directed
that is because they are sincere to us and that we might show them the power
but he is going to know
have they not seen how we made the earth a <unk> for them
do they then believe in the signs of allah
who is more unjust than he who fabricates lies against allah or denies his words
in the scorching fire
and those who strove hard in his cause will be presently
indeed allah does not foster the record of the beloved of the beloved of the beloved ones
alif lam
<unk>
aliflaammeem
the romans have been defeated
but when the noblest land is in the land they will be roasted in the land after their death
the command that will be yours
in allah s help ’
he helpeth to victory whom he wills
he is the most merciful
that is the grace of allah
allah does not break his purpose but most people do not know
they have made some of them but they are heedless
do they not see that allah created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with a known term
but most people disbelieve in the oneness of allah
have they not journeyed in the land and observed
they were more powerful than them and they were on the earth
and allah does not wrong them in the least
they wronged themselves
then they disbelieved in the signs of allah and evil were the worthiest of the evil ones
allah will then repeat it after he will then restore it to him
on that day the guilty will despair
and they will not be of those who associated others with allah in his divinity
so they will deny them
on that day the unbelievers will be hastening
but those who believe and do good deeds will be in gardens of peace and security
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations and those who disbelieve will be brought back into the everlasting life
it is he who has made the roof of allah and the evening
his is all praise in the heavens and the earth and he who goes out his face to the earth and who goes out his building on the brink of a way
he brings the living from the dead and brings the dead out of the living
even so you will be brought out
and he created you from dust then from a clinging mass
he has given you plenty of your life and plenty of plenty and plenty and hardship and boasting among you
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and to allah belongs the creation of the heavens and the earth and the difference of your languages and colours
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and of his signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon
surely in that are signs
and for fear of his signs is the morning and the earth
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
and the heaven and the earth will come out of his command and then he will call you to the paths of his own creation
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
all that is in the laden ship
it is he who created the first time and then repeats it
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
<unk>
he sets forth for you a parable from your own selves and your own selves and those whom we have given you
we thus explain the revelations for people who reflect
but they who do not follow their desires without any authority
so who is more astray than he who guides to the right way
they will have no saviors
so turn thou aside as a man cleaving to the purpose of allah
allah will not grant any change
that is the right religion but most people do not know
so turn your face to him and do not be of those who associate others with him
who is superior in number of every kind of halal sin
when a misfortune befalls him he cries out of his lord s mercy ’ upon them then he has set up associates to their lord
that is because we may give them the good things that we have warned them
then enjoy yourselves
did we not bring a clear authority to them
and when some disaster reaches him they exult thereat they were overwhelmed with their own hands
do they not see how allah extends provision for whom he wills and restricts it
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
and give them their right and their left
that is better for those who turn away
such are the ones who will be the successful
and give the fruit of allah that you may be satisfied with the wealth of allah and know that allah has full of kindness
it is allah who created you then he will cause you to die then he will bring you back to life
is there any of your associategods who can step to heed
glory be to him
and the people s hands are in the sea so that allah may cause them to die and they may be disappointed
say travel in the land and see what was the end of those before them
and indeed many of them were wrongdoers ’
so turn your face toward the sacred mosque before the day comes from allah
on that day they will be two faces foremost
and whosoever disbelieveth then whosoever disbelieveth his infidelity shall be fellows on the earth and whosoever worketh righteously his own souls shall be the bare
that is because allah has rewards those who believe and do good deeds
he is indeed a fierce fierce ablaze
and of his mercy is that he may bring you forth the ships and the sea that you may sail in it with his mercy and that you may seek of his bounty
we sent messengers before you
so we took vengeance upon them
the people of the city was our protector
it is allah who sends the winds that stir up the clouds and he spreads them in his mercy
you see them from the sky so that they rejoice in it
they were before them so that they might grow in mercy
look at the earth
he will surely give life to the dead and he is able to do all things
and if we will make the <unk> of a people who are able to see it
you can not make the dead hear nor turn their backs deaf to the call when they are turning away
nor dost thou guide the blind out of their error
you will only make the deaf and those who have submitted to our signs
allah is he who created you from dust then after he has made you die and then he turned you into scattered dust and bones
he creates what he wills
he is the knower
the day when the sinners will come out to them they will swear by the leave of the sinners
and those who were left behind and said “ you have stayed in it ”
this day you will not be recompensed except for this is the day of resurrection
so they will not be able to ask for them nor will they be asked to take heed
and we have certainly illustrated examples for all the people but if you were to see those who disbelieve will say you would surely have denied it
thus does allah seal the hearts of those who do not know
so indeed you are of the one who is allah s ’
let them not be negligent of the hereafter
alif lam

aliflaammeem
these are verses of the wise book
and speaks the right and the left
who establish prayer and pay zakah and are certain of the hereafter
they are on guidance from their lord
it is they who are the successful
and of mankind are some who purchase a common gain and then purchase a small gain from the way of allah they purchase fitnah disbelief and allah s words
for them is a shameful punishment
when our verses are recited to them they turn away haughtily as if they were averse to a notice of faith
you have warned them of a painful punishment
and those who believed and did good deeds will be made to inherit them
they will abide therein
the mould of allah is the truth
<unk>
he has created the heavens and the earth lest it should descend upon you and he has set you therein firm
and we sent down water from the sky and we make grow in it a goodly growth
these are the partisans of allah
then show me what you have created
nay but the wrongdoers are in manifest error
we gave luqman wisdom to lokman saying “ so whoever is grateful for his own good and thanks
and whosoever refuseth let him know that allah is rich the praised
when luqman said to his son “ my son i am old and my mother ”
do not ascribe any partners to allah
indeed allah does not associate anything with him ’
and we have enjoined upon his parents to be commemorated the two years and to his weaning
if they try to do anything with me that you have no knowledge of it
go to me with ease
then i will tell you what you used to do
o my son
and the weight of a mustardseed is in the heavens and the earth
allah is aware of what you do
o my son
so establish prayer and give zakah and be patient
verily this is of the <unk> of the muttaqun pious see v 2 2
and turn not away from men scorn away with pride nor walk proudly on earth
allah does not like any swaggering braggart
and be not loud in your rage
lo the harshest of all voices is the voice braying of the ass
do you not see that allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and of mankind there is he who disputeth concerning allah and his messenger muhammad saw and those who dispute about the scripture before him
and when it is said unto them obey they say we are in the hearts of our fathers
and if satan should show them the chastisement of the fire then how wretched is the truth
whosoever surrendereth his heart with a firm devotion for him is the most trustworthy handhold
all matters are in vain
and do not let the unbelievers deceive you
we will inform them of what they used to do
allah knows what is in their hearts
we shall grant them a little enjoyment for a while
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will say allah
say all praise be to allah
but most of them do not know
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
allah does not want to reduce the fruits of the prophet
and if all the trees in the earth were pens and the sea were ink with seven more seas to eat
verily allah is the rich
and that it is as a single man and a small creation
indeed allah is hearing and seeing
have you not seen how god makes the night to enter into the day and the day to move out for service to god
that is the truth and allah is the most high the most great
and he has subjected for you the ships that sail upon the sea by allah s command ’
these are the ones who will soon give thanks
when the time of prayer arrives they believed in allah s name ’
but when he delivereth them in the land they walk and still
and none reject our signs except those who deny our signs
o mankind
and fear your lord in which no measure can profit or harm
the true group of allah is indeed true
leave you alone by the leave of the life of this world
it is the knowledge of the hour
he knows what is in the wombs
no soul knows what it has done and he does not die
allah is aware of what you do
alif lam
<unk>
aliflaammeem
verily allah the creator of the heavens and the earth the lord of all the worlds
or do they say that “ he has himself ”
nay it is the truth from your lord that he may warn every person s people who have been true to what has been revealed before you so that they may be guided
allah it is who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he established himself
you have no power to help him nor any other protector
will they not reflect
he directs the affair from the heaven to earth and then it is a man cleaving to excel others in accordance with allah
the knower of the unseen and the seen
what has created every thing he created and created man from clay
then we gave his offspring from a worthless water
then he proportioned it and has proportioned you
little is the thanks you give
they say “ we are in a state of bitterness ”
nay they disbelieve in their lord
say “ die and you will gather you in the end of your lord ”
would that we had lain out of their graves and submitted “ our lord
now look at us we shall believe and we shall surely do the right
if we will we can do so and say “ then follow me ”
that is for what you used to earn
we too are you just a noble messenger
taste you the punishment for what you used to do
and those who believe in our revelations and do not behave with their lord with humility and they are not weary
and barter them with their lord in the night and by day and they hope for wealth and children
and no one will be recompensed for what they used to do
will he then not be a transgressor
they are not equal
as for those who believe and do righteous deeds for them is pardon and a reward for what they used to do
but as for those who do not believe — their abode is the fire
every time they desire to come forth from thence they shall be roasted and it shall be said unto them taste the torment of the burning
we will surely make them taste the terrible chastisement in order that they may be shown the greater way
and who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of his lord and turns away from them
verily we are going to requite the guilty
we gave moses the book to moses and we made it a guidance for the children of israel
we made a covenant with them and made from them leaders guiding by our command
your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
and how many generations have we destroyed before them who were guided by the way of allah
verily in that are signs
will they not listen
have they not seen that we drive out of the earth with it and they themselves from which they eat and they themselves drink
so they will not eat
they say when will this promise come if you are truthful
say the decree of the unbelievers will not be held in despised and the respite
so turn away from them and do not turn away
the very little is they too
o you prophet muhammad saw
fear allah and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites
indeed allah is knowing of all things
follow that which is revealed to you from your lord
allah is aware of what you do
and put your trust in allah
allah has not made two hearts inside any man for him who has made unlawful sexual intercourse with his body and does not pronounce his heart to be true
these are the things you have invented
allah shows the truth and guides to the right way
and call to the children of adam
that is more just with allah
in exchange for you and their fathers the religion
no fault in you if you do any sin for you is there any sin on you
allah is forgiving merciful
and the prophet is closer to their striving than their own creators
and also for those who were <unk> to their homes
these are the ones who have been in the book
and we took a covenant from you and noah and abraham
we took from them a solemn covenant
this is how allah has promised the truth and a painful punishment for the faithless
o you who believe
and remember when he commands you to remember the enemy of allah and we unleashed upon you stones upon their enemy and upon you we unleashed stones upon them stones
and allah is allseer of what you do
when they came upon you and yourselves assault you and the skins of war you were doubts
and we tested much that the hypocrites may be reclining upon dawud
when the hypocrites and those who say “ allah and his messenger has spoken to us ”
and when a party of them said o people of yathrib
you are not going to go back
but when some of them are asked to leave them they say ‘ our lord ’
but they were not but once stopping
they were living one to flee
and if it had been to fall down upon them from all this we would surely have given them the property of paradise and surely in this is a message of life
they are not devoted to god before this
they are pleased to be with allah
say “ if you owned this in your houses ”
say who is he who can protect you from allah if he wills harm you or intends you harm
they will not find for themselves besides allah any protector or helper
allah has prepared for us the charitable among you they say ‘ felicitous ’
lo
so when their waiting came upon them they will see that which they had suffered to you
then when you have made you taste of the impending calamity
such have not believed
allah has made their deeds fruitless
that is easy for allah
and the confederates think that they would not have thought that there would be a single city would have come to pass between you
and whosoever obeyeth allah and the last day and striveth not nigh
when they saw that he should say ‘ this is the obligation of allah ’
allah and his messenger has spoken the truth
it is their faith in this quran and in their faith
and among them are those who have made their covenant
among them are those who have fulfilled their vows and some are waiting for them they are not going to deprive them
that is because allah may prove the truthful for his truth and punish the hypocrites if he wills accept their repentance
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
allah will not drive the faithless back their hands and they will not touch any living thing
allah is sufficient for the believers
allah is the hearer of hunger
and he made a covenant from among the people of the book and he cast down from their strongholds and hearts
some you slew and some of them you took captive
he caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their possessions and a land which you have not trodden
allah is able to do all things
o you prophet muhammad saw
say o muhammad saw if you desire the present life and the world and the world then come you will come to pass in good end
but if you desire god and his messenger and the abode of the hereafter then surely god has prepared a great reward for the virtuous
o wives of the prophet
and whosoever of you an evildoer for him is an easy punishment
and whosoever of you believes in allah and his messenger and doeth right we shall give him a good provision for him
o wives of the prophet
you shall be like any old woman who are in your heart
and if you incline to one another in the heart of islamic monotheism then there is no constraint upon him
and stay in your houses
the tradition of the beloved of the beloved of the beloved of the beloved disbelievers
fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat
the people of the city are eager that allah may try you with the love of the people of the disbelievers
and remember allah s graces ’ and the graces of allah
indeed allah is ever allaware of what you do
the muslim women and the muslim men and women who are truthful and the truthful men and women who give alms and the truthful men and women who are truthful men and women who give alms and men and women who fear allah and the women who guard their
allah and his messenger and his trust in the matter of allah when he is a believer he will not lose his trust in allah and his words and his heart verily the false act is in manifest error
when you have proportioned him who has given his soul that he should not reveal to him saying ‘ be wary of allah ’
and allah s cause ’ has always made known to you in secret while you fear him
and when his lord stood up to you in the mind that he should let not the child get the inheritance of the believers
and ever is the command of allah accomplished
and there is no fault in the prophet to take away the wives of allah
they said “ and the decree of allah was fulfilled ”
they deliver the message of allah and he found none else than him
allah keepeth account
muhammad is not the father of any man among you but allah is ever unaware of all things
o you who believe
remember allah much
and the morning it is possible for him
it is he who sends down to you the shadows of the angels and the blessings of his own kind and he is the most merciful to you
peace be upon him the salutation
and allah has prepared for them a goodly reward
o you prophet muhammad saw
we have sent you as a witness and as a witness
and to call you by allah by his permission and as a light
give good news to them the humble from allah
and do not obey the faithless and the hypocrites
so put your trust in god and put your trust in god
and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs
o you who believe
and if they have reached their age then lo they have reached their term then there is no fault in them
so give them both their property and release with ease
o you prophet muhammad saw
we have made lawful for you o muhammad whom you have given dowries from their right hand possesses and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who had fought daughters to take the prophet s daughters ’ and to whom you marry free
and we know what their fathers had enjoined upon you
you will take away any of them for your wives and you will take no wages for yourself so that you may take away from them any wages and allah knows what they do not ask any other good
then if he pleases you o muhammad saw that which allah may choose you other than these other wives for other women for whom you have ordained for them and those whom your right hands possess
and allah is over all things competent
o you who believe
do not enter the houses of the prophet nor enter nor do you leave behind
but go into your houses and then they will enter the gate of ease
he has hastened to you and he hastened for you the suffering
and ask you for a wakil disposer of affairs
that is more proper and more means of theirs
and it is not for you to fall in the breast of allah s own heart
indeed that would be an enormous sin with allah
allah knows whatever you hide and whatever is in your hearts
their brothers their sisters their own brothers and children no fault in their possession or their own sons or their brothers
o you who have fear of allah
allah is witness over all things
indeed allah and his angels who are the messenger
o you who believe
and you are going to feed in the garden
verily allah and his messenger and allah hath gotten ready for them in this world and in the hereafter and for them is a humiliating torment
and when you have plotted a man and a flagrant sin for them
o you prophet muhammad saw
say o muhammad saw to your wives and your sons
that is more suitable for them
allah is forgiving merciful
and if he should strive in the city and <unk> for him then he would drive you out of disbelief and then they will not be able to extend your neighbors therein for you any danger
and the wife of black smoke
the wo nt of the past noah and you will never find any changing
people do not ask you about the hour
say allah knows what is in his knowledge
and what do you know maybe he is near
indeed he has prepared for the faithless a demeaning punishment
they will abide therein eternally and no intercessor
the day when their faces will be turned into the fire they will say “ alas if only we had not been muslims ”
they will say our lord
and we obeyed our command and they were from the astray
our lord
and we made them enter the garden and let them be consumed by force
o you who believe
allah cleared him of all that they said and he is extremely munificent
o you who believe
fear allah and speak to him and speak words that haply you will be truthful
he will make your deeds go straight and forgive your sins
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his apostle he shall be a mighty achievement
and we made the hills to grow and they were its guards
but man has brought it to the dead
verily it is he who hath done wrong and lo
that is because allah has forgiven them and the hypocritical men and idolatrous women and the idolatrous men and idolatrous women and the idolaters and idolatrous women who turn away from their ownselves and allah is ever oftforgiving most merciful
praise belongs to allah the lord of the heavens and the earth
and to him belongs all praise and he is well aware of what is in the hereafter
he knows what penetrates into the earth and what comes out of it from descend from it
he is the forgiving the merciful
the unbelievers say ‘ the hour has come to us ’
say yes by my lord he will surely come to you
and nothing is hidden from him in the heavens and the earth
and that which is less than this or greater than this but it is recorded in a manifest book
that is because allah will give those who believe and do good deeds
for them are men of modest and sustenance
and those who are predestined to make the worst of punishment for them is the worst punishment
who is given knowledge of the book that he may guide you by the truth from your lord
and the unbelievers say shall we inform you of something like you when he is in a vast way
he is a burden for him who has been laden with madness
nay but those who disbelieve in the hereafter are in vain pride
have they not seen how we have created in heaven and earth
if we will we can make the earth swallow them or cause a fragment of the sky to fall down
surely in that is a sign for every penitent servant
and we bestowed upon david the son of maryam and we said o david and be with him “ o mountains ”
and we made its iron for him
and said make your father for the measure and the poor
o david
i am observant of what you do
and we made the wind flow in the morning and we made the wind flow for him and we made water a spring of tar flow
and whoever of his lord s command ’ we will seize him with a punishment of the inferno
the jinn made for him leaders of <unk> into the <unk>
o my people
and the thankful
when the command of the people passed away we made for him his wife hawwa eve away and he cast his staff into the sea
and when the earth became exposed to the east they would not have continued in the unseen
and there were two of the two of egypt and said to them eat of the two men and give thanks to him
that is the forgiving and kind
so we sent them at sunrise and we let them taste a dam and we let loose on them a dam and a few of them taste the fruit of the dam
that is how we requited them for their ingratitude
will we not make any more worthy of the <unk>
and the two of the mount saying “ go out to the oppressed by the devils who asks “ travel in the morning ”
they will say our lord
and make the distance between the spectacle and the beloved of your people and we found them in error
indeed those who are grateful and are grateful
and they followed the command of joseph until they are one of the other
but it was not a test for mankind to take it except that we might test you thereby and your lord is the allknowing
say call upon those other than allah
they do not possess the weight of the heavens and the earth nor do they have any partnership in the creation of the heavens and the earth nor do they have any partnership in them
none can ask except his wife whom he wills
and they will be told “ what is your lord ”
and he is the high the grand
say who provides for you from the heavens and the earth
so you are either a man or a manifest way ”
say you are not going to be questioned
say our lord will judge between us equitably and then will judge between us with justice
he is the best of all knowing
say show me those whom you have attached to him as partners
no
he is allah ’
we have sent you o muhammad saw as a messenger muhammad saw as a messenger muhammad saw to mankind but most men know not
they say ‘ when will this promise be fulfilled if you are truthful ’
say “ you will now see a single day when you will see it or punishment ”
they said “ we wish neither stand before this nor could you be able to speak to the wrongdoers before their lord ” they will say “ we were not believers ”
they will say ‘ ‘ be your brethren ’ ‘ ‘ ’ ‘ ’
nay but ye yourselves were sinners
they will say ‘ no
you should believe in allah and his messenger and do not see us when they are commanded to disbelieve in him
and their necks will be only for what they used to do
and we sent not a messenger to enter its water until they said “ we disbelieve in it ”
they said “ we are more powerful than killing and we are the ones who will be patient ”
say my lord outspreads and straitens his provision to whomsoever he will
but most people do not know
and do not drive us near your wealth nor else than that which has been sent down to us
those will have their hands and feet — for what they have earned
and those who strive in our revelations challenging they will be set free from them
say my lord outspreads and straitens his provision to whomsoever he will
and allah is allaware of whatever he wills
he is the best of providers
on the day when he will gather them together then he will say to the angels “ these are they whom you used to worship ”
they will say glory be to you
they are not aware of us
nay but they were wo nt to worship the jinn and the most of them were believers
today none of you can harm or profit a nation
we will say “ taste the punishment of the fire ”
when our clear signs are recited to them they say this is nothing but a magic that is merely a lie that your fathers worshipped but the false deities
and when the truth comes to the blasphemers they say ‘ this is nothing but obvious magic ’
and they say we have given them the book before you and we gave them a book before you
those before them also denied the truth so they were also rejected
but they denied my punishment
say “ god has appointed for you a single thing ”
he is the most merciful of you
say i am to you a light of the quran
my friend is only with allah
he is witness over all things
say my lord projects
he is the knower of all things
say the truth has come to it falsehood or has it been accepted
say if i had forged me i should be one of the ignorant
lo he is hearer nigh
would that you could see when they are terrified for they are in the fire
they will say we believe in it
how can they be held in the land
but before this they denied him and were about
and that which they should feed sixty poor persons
they were in a great doubt
all praise belongs to allah who created the heavens and the earth and the two of the two three
he guides whom he wills
indeed allah is over all things competent
and allah is not one to check from the people and there is none that can avert it
<unk>
o mankind
remember allah s favour ’ upon you
is there any creator other than allah who provides for you from the heaven and the earth
there is no god except he
so where are you being led away
if they belie you then were messengers before you we too messengers
to allah all matters are referred
o mankind
the true group of allah is indeed true
so leave me alone with the life of this world and do not let satan deceive you
indeed satan is an enemy to you so you make an enemy
he will call out his gang
and those who disbelieve and forgive but those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a great reward
is he equal to one who has been righteous deeds and walks in the middle way
allah leads astray whomever he wills and guides whomever he wills to a straight path
allah knows what they do
it is allah who sends the winds that stir up the clouds we drive them out of a dead land and then we bring them forth from it a new creation
and the fruits
whosoever desireth to meet allah he is the most beneficent allah and he is the most merciful
and for those who do evil there will be a painful punishment and their plots will be annulled
allah created you from dust then from a sperm drop and then he brought you forth
and none can be held behind except he who is behind
and his wealth is only for him and this is easy
the two seas are not alike one fresh sweet and sweet and pleasant to drink
and eat of all that they will go away and go away from it
you see the ship cleaving you through it and that you may magnify allah for his bounty
he causes the night to enter into the day and he merges the day into the night
each one runs its appointed course
such is allah your lord
and his dwelling and the hair of the palm trees of the datestone
if you heard they will not hear your prayer and if they heard their ears they will not hear it
on the day of resurrection they will disown you
and none can inform you of like him who is aware
o mankind
you are the people who are in the <unk>
allah is the rich
if he will he can put you away in your place then resurrect you
and that is not difficult for allah
no burdened soul carries a burden for the burden of another nor does he be burdened with hardship nor does he be able to help him
you only warn those who fear their lord in secret and perform the prayer
and whosoever purifies himself he is cleansed for his own sake
and to allah is the final return
not alike are the blind
light and light
nor are alike alike
nor are alike the living nor the dead
allah giveth the truth to whom he will
you will not cause those who are in the graves to die
you are only a <unk> of those who are engrossed in your book
we have sent you o muhammad saw as a messenger to be sent as a messenger and a warner
and if they deny you they would have already denied before them the truth and the scriptures of the holy prophet had come to them with clear proofs and the scriptures of the holy prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him
then i seized them and how was my retribution
have you not seen how allah sends down water from the sky and from the mountains and the crops of varying colors
and in the cattle there is a sign and a lesson in which there is a difference of heart
and you will be told ‘ ‘ ‘ ’
allah is forgiving merciful
lo those who read the book of allah and perform assalat iqamatassalat and give zakat and obey the truth which we have bestowed upon them and they are in doubt about the unseen
so that allah may bestow his grace upon them and bestowed upon them from his bounty
he is forgiving responsive
we have revealed to you the book of truth confirming what was before it
allah is aware of his servants
then we made the book to be as we have made inheritors
and among them are those who wronged themselves and some are the ones who leave it by allah s leave
that is the supreme success
they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and gold embroidery bracelets of gold will be adorned with bracelets of gold and gold embroidery
and they will say all praise belongs to allah who has removed all sorrow from us
indeed allah is allforgiving allappreciative
he it is who hath given us increase in the everlasting life and in which there will not touch us tall nor toil
but as for the unbelievers theirs is the fire of gehenna they will not be able to stay in it forever and they will have the suffering of the fire
thus do we requite every thankless soul
they will cry out “ our lord
bring us out of your life that we may do not bid us to work righteousness
will you not see that we had given you long enough span of long ago
has there not been a reminder for you
so taste the punishment for the unjust ”
indeed allah is the allknower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth
he knows what is in the hearts
it is he who has created you in the earth
their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers in their lord s sight
the disbelief of the disbelievers adds nothing but loss
say “ have you considered other than god
show me what they have created on earth
or do they own the kingdom of the heavens and the earth ’
or have we given them a book so that they stand upon a clear register
no the wrongdoers do not see anything except delusion
indeed allah did not create the heavens and the earth except him
he is forgiving and forbearing
they swear by allah that when they came to them with a guidance they would not have increased them in guidance
but they waxed proud in the land and they do not believe in it
and they await the consequence of the ancients
you will never find for him a change in the way of allah
have they not travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them
there is nothing in the heavens and earth except allah
indeed he is allknowing allpowerful
if allah were to take people to task for what they earned he would not leave a moving creature on earth but he gives them respite for their deeds
ya seen
by the <unk>
you are indeed one of the noble messengers
on a straight way
this is a revelation from allah and the most beneficent allah
their case are not a people who are unaware
most of them do not believe in the word of allah they are the ones who will not believe
it is he who carries around their necks
and we destroyed them in a township they were not able to lay overturned in it and they were covered with open speech
and it is the same to those who have faith whether you leave them or do not believe they are the same
you only follow the way of allah who follows the most merciful the most merciful
give glad tidings to the servants of a generous wage
it is we who revive the dead and we record their deeds
and we have kept within their hearts
and when the messengers came to them from the people of the city
and when we sent unto them twain they strengthened their own company but they said verily we have been sent unto you a messenger
they said you are nothing but a man like us
allah is the knower of all that is revealed to you
you are only speakers who is false and invent lies
they said our lord knows that we have been sent to you and we are messengers
and our messenger is only to convey the message
they said we have found fighting in you
if you do not desist we will surely stone you and will inflict upon you a painful punishment
they said ‘ your evil omens are your own souls
will you not take the advantage of allah
nay but ye are a people extravagant
and the queen of his sheep said “ i have obtained a limit moving
go in company with ease
and follow not those who are guided by you and are rightly guided
what is the matter with me that you will return to him
and should i have no power over any other lord beside him nor can i remove any harm from him nor can they help me
so i am going to seduce him
i am indeed a noble messenger to you ”
and it is said to him “ enter paradise ”
he said would that i could have observed the labour
my lord has forgiven me and my brother
we sent down upon him from heaven and we never sent down any army of the heaven nor would we have done
and they were but a shout and they were extinguished
woe to the unbelievers
and there came not unto them any one but they used to deride him
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them who were mightier in power than these and the same way
all shall be returned to us
a sign for them is a sign
we will then give it from it grain so they will eat
and we have placed therein gardens of date palms and vines and fruits
so that they may eat of his fruit and their hands
will they not give thanks
glory be to him who created the heavens and the earth
and a sign for them is the night
we strip off the day from which they will emerge
and the sun and the moon
such is the ordinance of allah
and the moon we have appointed it as a light and it is witnessed
neither can he make the sun nor the moon hear
each one of them will go in deep
and we have made the offspring of old a large group in them
how many a generation we have created for them
if we will we drown them for their sins then they will not be able to be helped
except for those whom our mercy enfolds them and for a specified term
and when it is said to them “ beware of the hereafter and fear allah and avoid the displeasure of the hereafter that you may attain mercy ”
and no sign comes to them from their lord but they do not turn away from it
and when it is said to them “ spend of allah s cause ’ which he has provided you ”
you are but a plain enemy
they will say “ when will this promise be upon if you are truthful ”
they are not set in the night with draweth nigh
they will not go to able to make a testament nor will they return to their households
and when the trumpet will be blown they will be humbled from their lord
they will say “ woe to us
who has roused us from our sleepingplace
this is the word of allah the merciful
and it will be all of them to us as if they were before us
this day no soul will be wronged in the least and you will not be wronged
and verily the dwellers of the garden are brought near unto the twain
they will recline on the shade
therein they will have fruits and they will have whatever they desire
and they will say peace be upon them “ peace ”
“ o you guilty
children of adam did i not serve you that you serve me he is a manifest enemy
worship me
that is the straight way
and has already misled many of you
will they then not then understand
this is the fire that is the morning of the disbelievers
roast in it today for you were unbelievers
so today their tongues will be <unk> with us and their feet will bear witness against them
if we will we could have made the blind so they would not have guided any one to the right way
then how could they lay aside
if we willed we could have reduced them to turn away from them so they can not turn back
and who hoard perdition
will they not then reflect
we did not give him any angel
this is only a reminder and a man who is concealed
“ in order to be ruined ”
do they not see that we have created them from their own hands
and the needy he also gave his fruit and pastures
for them are other benefits and drinks
and even if he is grateful
and they will be made for hell instead of allah
but they will not help them on the least they will be called to victory
so do not grieve you
we know what they hide and what they disclose
does he think that we will not see him
that is a manifest sin
he struck us a similitude and said who can conquer
say he who created them the first time
he will bring you out of it a fire
and he created the heavens and the earth
he is the knower of the unseen
and when he decrees a thing he says to it be and it is
glory be to him
to him you will be returned
by those who move about the angels and the earth
and <unk>
and the angels who took away their hands
indeed your efforts <unk>
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
indeed we have beautified it is a reminder
and we made it a strict doer of every kind of protection
they will not listen to the extent of their labour and they will not come to pass away from the fruits of their labour
and they will have a painful punishment
but whosoever is in a collective affair he shall roast him
ask them that is more difficult to create or that we have the power to create them
we created them from sticky clay
you were to draw near to them
so they will not listen
and when he saw a plot they would mock at him
and they say “ this is nothing but a magic spell ”
what when we are dead and become dust shall we then be raised again
o muhammad
say yes and you will be raised up
and he is one of them and they will be in the midst of a single blow
they will say “ woe to us
this is the day of reckoning ”
this is the day of eternity ”
and the angels will say to the angels “ do not command them to worship ”
and they will find them besides allah the fire
they will be questioned
and it will be said to the guilty you will be helped
nay on that day they will be resurrected
and they will turn away
they will say “ you were one of us ”
no you will say ‘ you will not be able to speak ’
nay but ye were not a people exorbitant
our lord has reached us
we will certainly taste the punishment
we led you into the footsteps of the virtuous
we were indeed your forefathers ’
verily they will be in the torment on that day
thus do we recompense the guilty
they will say “ god is there any god except he ”
and say will ye not ward off evil for what a drink
nay he hath brought the truth and the apostles
you will certainly know the painful punishment
and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do
but god s wife ’ is always reverting
for them is a known provision
and the shade of paradise
all this is bound to fall upon them
in the gardens of delight
on couches facing one another
and they were filled with a cup of pure drink
a drink of delicious delicious to drink
the living from which neither darkness will be cool nor any intoxication
and with them are maidens of restrained glances
even as the heads
they will turn to him in repentance
one of them will say “ i had a companion ”
who used to pray
when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we be brought forth
he said ‘ you are also thieves ’
he will look down and see the companions of hell
and will say by allah you destroy me
and had it not been for the grace of my lord i would have been among those brought forward to hell
“ what do we then see ”
“ and we will not be punished ”
this is indeed the supreme success
let the like of the wrongdoers
is this better or is it you who are thieves
and we have made it a livelihood for the unjust
it is a tree of <unk>
its fruit is as it were spread out
the guilty will eat
then they will be in a drink of scalding water
then they will indeed be to hell
they found their fathers on the day of resurrection
and they will be dimmed
and most of them were wrongdoers
we sent messengers to them
so see what sort of fate befell those who were before them
except the command of allah
he said and how excellent a station we are
and we saved him and his family from the great distress
his offspring are the same for him
then we left for him a good name in posterity
and peace be upon him
thus do we reward the doers of good
indeed he was of our high ranking firmly
then we drowned the rest
abraham was indeed an object of prayer
and when he came to solomon of his lord with a pure heart
he said to his father and his brother what do you worship
and do not neglect god for the other than god
and what is your opinion of the worlds
he will bring a new life in the heavens
he said ‘ i am ’
they turn away therefrom and saw
then he came to their gods saying ‘ you will not eat
what is the matter with you that you do not speak
then we destroyed them with a <unk>
and the two whole command came to him
he said “ what is your opinion –
he created you and what you make
they said “ do not find this to be a kind of omen to moosa and his court ”
they plotted to him so we made them appear to appear to him
he said “ i am lord of the truth
he guides me to the right way
he said my lord
grant me a meritorious child ”
so we gave him the good news of a forbearing son
he said “ o my son i am sacrificing you over me
look how will you see
he said o my father
and he was bent upon me
allah willing you will find me in my sight
then he flung him down and flung him down upon his forehead
then we said o ibrahim
you have already told you
thus do we reward the doers of good
this is a manifest trial
we gave him his family in a great distress
and we left for him a goodly remembrance in posterity
and peace be upon abraham
thus do we reward the doers of good
indeed he was of our high ranking firmly
and we gave him the glad tidings of a prophet the prophet
and we gave him isaac and jacob
and among them is he who has done good and the wrong
and we have certainly given moses and aaron
and treasures and a great wave
and they will be victorious
and we gave to moses the scripture
and showed him the way
and we left for him favorable mention among later generations
and moses and aaron
thus do we reward the doers of good
they will say “ we are our devoted servants ”
lo
when he said to his people will you not fear
how will you pass away
and your lord and lord of your forefathers
they denied him and they were not one of those who rejected him
except the command of allah
and we left for him a goodly remembrance in posterity
and peace be upon the house
thus do we reward the doers of good
indeed he was of our high ranking firmly
and verily lot s family
and we saved him and his family all
except an old woman who remained behind
then we destroyed the rest
and if you do in their morning they will be in the morning
and at the morning will you not understand
and verily the <unk>
when a fire is set in it
and the others flung themselves
and he became well aware of it
had he not been of the scoffers
he will speak to us
then he made it hard
and we made a gourd tree of gourd
and we sent him to a hundred thousand years
so we destroyed them for a while
ask them “ the daughters of your lord are for them ”
or did we create the angels females while they were witnesses
they utter lies
allah says “ allah does not renege on him ”
they are liars
do you prefer the sons of allah
what is the matter with you how do you judge
will you not reflect
or have you a clear proof
then bring your book if you are truthful
they know that they will be arraigned in hell
glory be to allah from that which they associate
except the command of allah
they are neither your friends nor your friends
you can not help against allah against him
except he who will roast in hell
and angels said “ every possessor of sustenance
we are the rangers
we are indeed sincere
they will say ‘
“ if we had been able to do it
we will surely be among the chosen servants
but they denied it so they will soon know
and our word came to pass
and it will be said to them “ help them
verily our promise will come to pass
so turn away from them
see they will see the punishment
do they seek to hasten our punishment
and when their houses is barren
so turn away from them
see they will see the punishment
glory be to allah the lord of the throne
and peace be upon the messengers
and praise be to allah the lord of the worlds
sad
by the <unk>
the faithless are proud and boastful
how many a generation we have destroyed before them and they were wo nt to lay out their nights
so a messenger came to them from the unbelievers they said ‘ this is a magician a mendacious liar ’
he has created them
this is indeed a strange thing ”
they both went away saying go ahead and go away
indeed this is a curious thing
we did not leave this in the mosques
and naught is this but a thing
so do you not remember
nay but they are in doubt about my life
or are they the treasures of your lord and the treasures of your lord
and to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them
let them keep the river
this is a <unk> of corn
before them the people of noah ad and a ad ’ denied the truth
and the tribe of thamud and the people of lut and the people of lut
for every one of them denied the truth and my threat
so they are waiting so oft as they are silent
they will say ‘ our lord
grant us our gift before the day of reckoning
and bear with patience
we subjected the mountains to glorify him with him and they were with him morning
and the birds when we withdraw from him the <unk>
and we gave him wisdom and knowledge and we made his passage
and has the story of the hordes
when they are extinguished
and they entered upon david
they said fear not we have indeed been afraid
and give us your right religion and do not be unjust to us with the right way
this my brother has ninety and he said “ i have preferred me above all the throne ”
he said “ he has made lawful to you that you may be disheartened by your lord and do good for those who accepted faith and did good deeds and do not repent except for the wife of your lord and do not incline ”
we have made this as a fine dwelling for him and we have made it a fine dwelling place
o dawud david we made you a place of rest
so judge between men equitably and follow not and from the path of allah which he has made you grow up
indeed those who denied the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah for them is a painful punishment
and we created the heaven and the earth and all that is between them
that is the opinion of those who disbelieve
woe to the faithless
we have made those who believe and do good works equal we have made the earth equal to the like of the agents of corruption
this is a blessed book and the quran that we have revealed to you and an admonition for those who possess intellect
and we bestowed upon david solomon
how excellent a slave
the obstinate opponent of allah
and at dawn when they entered upon their sides and cast down to him a mosque
he said i am close to the setting of the sun s remembrance ’
he said to him “ bring them horses and he began to seduce ”
we cast upon the hearts of a sperm
then he turned to him in repentance
he said my lord
forgive me and my brother and join me after me
you are indeed one of the ingrates
and we subjected the wind to sail at his bidding wherever he liked
and the <unk> of <unk>
and we followed him and we followed him
“ o ibrahim ”
he has indeed brought us nigh and a good place of nearness
and remember job when he called to his lord saying “ my lord has afflicted me with suffering and pain ”
we said to him “ bind the stars ”
that is for bathing and drinking
we bestowed on him a mercy from us and a reminder for him who is a blessing from us and a reminder
then we opened his family with him saying take care of him
we found him patient
verily we have made it a <unk>
how excellent a slave
and remember ibrahim abraham and ishmael
we shall sustain them with the home of the hereafter
they are the best of us
and ishmael and elisha
all are among them the best
this is a reminder
for those who fear god there is a good place of refuge
the gardens of eden whereof the gates are opened for them
reclining on couches they will call for plenteous fruit and drink
and their eyes will be of the fruits of the <unk>
the feeding of the day of resurrection will be it for you
nay
so look
and indeed for the transgressors is an evil destination
in which are <unk> and bad dwelling
this is scalding water and pus
and the disbelievers are like of it
and the unbelievers will say this is a welcome
no welcome for them
they are indeed the army of the fire ’
they will say no welcome for you
you are our lord
what an evil restingplace
they will say our lord
who has kept prepared this for us double it
they will say what is the matter with us that we were not doing wrong
we made them the like of their deeds and they were not aware of it
verily this is a fire of glass
say “ i am only one god the one the irresistible ”
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and all that is between them
say “ it is a tremendous news ”
from which you are turning away
so they were not of those who had been warned
i am only a clear warner to you ”
recall what time thy lord said unto the angels verily i am going to create a mortal from clay
so when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my spirit
all prostrated themselves
except iblis he was arrogant and became one of the disbelievers
he said o iblis
what prevented you from prostrating before one whom i have created with both my hands
you were one of the late ones ’
he said i am better than him
you created me from fire and you created him from clay
he said then get out of here for you are expelled
and your lord s ’ punishment ’ is the day of recompense ”
iblis said my lord
respite me till they are raised
he said “ you are among the ones that are respited ”
the day of the night
he said by your means moses i will surely seduce them all
except your hand o you will be among those who are your mother
he said “ this is my truth and i only follow the truth ”
i will follow you and all those who follow you ”
say i ask of you no wage for it
this is only a reminder for all the mindful
you will come to know
this is a book that has been revealed to muhammad
we have sent down to you the book as a messenger so worship allah alone
the matter belongs to god and to god belongs the exclusive
and those who take protectors besides him say we are only more than allah
allah will judge between them in their disputes
allah does not guide the faithless lot
allah has created of it from its <unk>
glory be to him
he is allah the one the irresistible
he created the heavens and the earth in truth
he subjected the sun and the moon each running its course for an appointed term
he is forgiving owner of goodness
he created you from a single soul then he made you die then he made it up
he has already made you a prey of your homes in the darkness of the cattle and the angels who are in their hearts
such is allah your lord
his is the kingdom
there is no god except he
so where are you being led away
and know that allah is rich free of all wants and allah is the perfect his slaves
if you are thankful
no fault can bear the burden of your lord then you will return to the guilty
he is aware of what you do
he knows what is in their hearts
and when adversity touches him he calls upon him a man he prays
then he causeth man to die and he <unk> away from the way of allah which he has laid away from the way of him
say ‘ this is a little
lo thou art of the owners of the blaze
do you not prostrate to the angels and morning and those who bow in adoration seeking the way of his lord morning and evening
say are the equal
so do they learn a lesson or a lesson
say o my servants who believe
be wary of your lord
for those who do good in this world there is good and allah is bounteous knowing
except those who are patient and are patient ”
say “ i am commanded to worship god making religion pure for him only
i am commanded to be one of those who surrender
say “ i fear the punishment of a fire ”
say “ i worship god with allexclusive for him ”
so worship whatever you wish besides him
say verily the losers are they who will lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection
that is the obvious loss
and the fire of fire beneath them and covered them
by allah s dispensation ’
so fear me
and those who turn away from the worship of allah
and fear allah
those who follow their own souls and follow the best of it and it is they who are the ones who are the rightly guided
the word of punishment shall be realized against those who can not be like a sinner nor shall they be destroyed
but those who fear their lord will have mansions beneath which rivers flow
this is the grace of allah
allah does not break his purpose
have you not seen how god sends down water from the sky and quickens the earth after it had died and quickens it out of the earth and quickens them out of it they wither and then you see them yellowing and indeed in this are signs for people
is he equal with the beneficence of allah and the angels who are not equal to the darkness of his lord
so woe to those whose hearts are hard against the remembrance of allah
they are indeed transgressors
allah has sent down the best of statements the quran to be the knower of the book and the qur an ’
then they slaughtered allah s bond and themselves in the measure and the cattle that is allah s
he guides whom he wills and whomever he wills to guide him
and the chastisement of a grievous day will come upon him who will be fearful of the day of resurrection
and it is said to the wrongdoers taste
those before them also denied the truth came upon them so the punishment came upon them from where they were unaware
so allah made them taste disgrace in the life of this world and indeed the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they but knew
we have explained in detail for people who reflect
and we have sent down upon them a clear arabic so that they may be godwary
the two men of old are the one who is a man of old
are they equal in similitude
all praise belongs to allah but most of them do not know
nor can you die and they are mortal
then on the day of resurrection you will dispute before your lord
who is more unjust than he who invents lies about god or denies his words
is there not in hell a residence for the disbelievers
and whosoever bringeth the truth and whosoever hath become almuttaqun the truth tellers
they will have whatever they wish with their lord
that is the reward of the doers of good
thus does allah will give their deeds the best of what they did and reward them for what they used to do
does allah not create the human being like of his creation
they frighten you with others than it
and whomever allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
and whosoever allah guideth unto him allah guideth him
is not allah able to requite the <unk>
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will say allah
say have you considered if allah should pleased to bring me some other than allah so that you may bring me mercy from him or do they desire some mercy
say “ god is sufficient for me ”
in him let all the trusting put their trust ’
say o my people
act according to your power i am acting
but you will know
he will punish whom a punishment will come and upon whom will descend a lasting punishment
and we have sent down to you the book which is recited to you
and whosoever goes astray will be his own loss
you are not a dictator of their own hands
allah does not take the death while he has made it still they are in neglect
so decree is the decree of a decree
surely in that are signs for a people possessing understanding
or have they taken intercessors against themselves
say “ if they have anything anything of the hereafter ”
say to allah belongs all intercession
to him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
then you will be returned to him
when allah alone mentioned in the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter they rejoice
say o allah the creator of the heavens and the earth
and the one who goes away from among you
and the earth will be like them and the like of it they will surely be in the same as the wrongdoers they will surely be able to ransom themselves from allah and they will not be able to repel the punishment
and their evil deeds will appear to them and what they used to deride
when misfortune befalls us he says “ we are more afflicted with child ”
nay it is a test but most of them know not
so did those before them but did not avail them
so the evils of the evils of the distressed they will be afflicted by what they earned and they will be seized by what they used to earn
do they not know that allah eases the sustenance for whomever he wills
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
say o my people
verily allah forgives all sins
he is the forgiving the merciful
and if there comes to you from your lord before the punishment overtakes you and then you will not be helped
if a warner comes to you from your lord before the most merciful comes upon you suddenly while you are unaware
then he said “ woe to me i will not be a greater wrongdoer ”
or lest it should say if allah had guided me i should have been among the godfearing
and that he should say “ alas if only i had a good chance to return ”
but indeed you were before them and became one of the faithless
you will see the fabricators of lies against god on the day of resurrection
is not the destination of the blazing fire
allah will deliver those who ward off evil
evil will not touch them nor will they be distressed
allah is the creator of all things and he is the allknower of everything
to allah belong the keys of the heavens and the earth and those who disbelieve in the signs of allah it is they who are the losers
say o muhammad saw o my lord
it is inspired to you o muhammad saw saying “ i will be your deeds and you will be among the losers ”
so worship allah and be among the grateful
they are not appraised allah with his servants and the heavens will be in the earth
glory be to him high be he exalted above what they associate
and whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on earth shall be whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
then he broke it into a second time
and the earth will shine with its lord and the matter will be decided between them equitably and they will not be wronged
every soul shall be paid in full for what it has earned
allah knows best what they do
and those who disbelieve will be driven onto hell till when they reach it they will say to its keepers of hell and its keepers will be read out to them “ did not the messengers of your lord and warning you of this day come to you ”
they will say “ the word of the faithless ”
and it will be said to them “ enter the gates of hell to dwell forever ”
evil is the lodging of the proud
and those who feared their lord will be driven to paradise till when they reach it its gates are opened and its keepers will say peace be upon you
enter the gates of ease for you
they will say “ praise be to god who has fulfilled us and we will surely settle out the earth in paradise wherever we wish
how excellent is the reward of those who laboured
and all praise unto their lord thou wilt see the angels
and all the praises and thanks be to allah the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
ha mim
aliflaammeem
a revelation from allah s ’ scriptures
that is the forgiver the most merciful
there is no god except he
to him is the kingdom
none disputes concerning allah save the revelations of allah
and before them we took their places of importance and appointed for them a fire and they differed
so the unbelievers will be in the sight of their lord
and the angels who bear the throne and the praise of their lord and believe in him and his words saying our lord
and forgive you and all that is in your sin and deserve your sin
our lord
and admit them to the gardens of eternity which you will and purify them
you are indeed lying
and put them on the day you will be responsible for it and you will find the right way ”
that is the supreme success ’
and it was said to the disbelievers “ were you thankless ”
they will say our lord
twice you have made us die and twice
we have made ourselves inherit
is there any way of water to come from the fire
that is because when allah was sent down to him you disbelieved in it
so the judgement belongs to allah and his messenger
it is he who sends down for you from the heaven and the earth
so do you turn away from him who turns away
and make the unbelievers die while they are averse to him
and he is the lord of the throne the allglorious
that is he who sent down inspiration to his command on the day of resurrection
on that day mankind will be hidden from allah and his noble messenger
allah will say to him belongs all sovereignty this day
and whoever is in allah the absolute owner of all things ’
that day each soul will be paid in full for what it has earned and they will not be wronged
indeed allah is swift at reckoning
the day when the trumpet will be choking the wrongdoers will be a near and the wicked will have neither any friend nor intercessor
allah knows what is in the breasts of the chests
allah decreeth naught with justice and he hath no judge
allah is hearer seer
have they not travelled in the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those before them
they were greater in power than they and mightier in strength
so allah seized them with punishment and they were not able to take heed for themselves
so when their messengers came to them with clear signs they were rejecting the truth so allah seized them for their ingratitude
he is strong severe in retribution
and we sent moses and his brother harun
and the grain of the tongue and they came to him saying a sorcerer but a liar
and moses said to them “ come to us with him and let the people who believe in him and let their families share in the right way ”
but but the guile of the unbelievers is in vain
he said let me slay the lord of me
i fear that he may change your religion or that he may cause corruption in the land
he said i believe in god and your lord and your lord
and when he had fallen into his shirt from his lord said “ you have a man who is god but he says my lord is a clear proof ”
if he had heard his message he would have heard his message and if there comes upon you a thousand angels will not be able to bring you back on you
allah does not guide the transgressors
o you who have been stingy
this day the day when the earth is spread out for you
who will save us from the punishment of allah if it comes upon us from him
he said i only answer you only i only guide you to the right way
so he poured out his womb
i fear for you the chastisement of a day when it is a terrible day
and indeed we fear them and the tribe of a ad and thamud and those who were destroyed before them
o you who have been stingy
i fear lest i fear for you the day of resurrection
and remember the day when you will turn back on the day when allah will find no protector or helper
you did not believe in what has come to you in this matter which you were given
thus allah sendeth astray and willeth
there is no harm in the sight of allah except those who dispute concerning allah s signs ’ and his apostle who believe with him a terrible punishment
thus allah presents the allknower of every kind
he said “ o my people
that i may be a sign for me
i am the first of moses and haman
thus it is an excellent promise and he was hindered
and the evil of the quraish
he said o my people
follow me i will guide you to the path of rectitude
o my people
the life of this world is but an enjoyment of the hereafter
and whosoever does an evil deed shall not be recompensed except according to what he has done and he shall be recompensed for their deeds
o my people
so what is it that you who made me succeed you yourselves
you have no value to disbelieve in allah and i have no doubt about what i have no knowledge and i call you to the creed of those who call you to the straight path
you can not have any share in this world nor in the hereafter
and you will tell me what i say
i confide my affair with god
indeed allah is ever over the <unk> ’
so allah saved him from what they had been building and the morning seized them
the day when the hour takes place for them and he will protect them from a painful punishment
and when they are cast into the fire they will say to the oppressed “ you are now going to stay in it ”
said the proud “ this is the matter of the arrogant ”
allah has already caused to gush forth between us
and the skins of the disbelievers will say “ the fire will be your lord s punishment ’ that day seizes us ”
the angels will say “ did not the bright wind come to you ”
they will say “ yes ”
and the angels will say “ but the intentions of the disbelievers are in vain ”
we will surely help ourselves and the needy
the day when the harmdoers will not profit them nor will they be suffered for evil
and we gave moses the guidance and we bequeathed the children of israel
a guide and a reminder for those who possess intellect
and persevere
verily the mould of allah is true
and ask forgiveness of your lord and in the morning
indeed those who dispute concerning allah without any authority having any proof having any proof except the greatness of allah
they are unable to hear
so seek refuge in allah
he is the hearer the beholder
the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind but most people do not know
and the blind and the seeing are not equal nor are those who believe and do good works equal
how little do you remember
indeed it is a sign but most people do not know
your lord said call me to what i will give you
indeed those who wax proud enter hell and are abased in it
it is allah who created the night for you to rest the day and he it is who has appointed for you
allah is gracious to mankind but most people do not give thanks
that is allah your lord the creator of all things
how then are you perverted
thus they who disbelieve in the signs of allah
it is allah who made the earth a fixed abode and he made for you the sky a canopy and he provided you with good things
that is allah your lord
blessed is allah the lord of the worlds
he will abide there for him
supplicate to him
and praise be to allah the lord of the worlds
say i have been forbidden to worship those you call upon other than allah and to submit to the lord of the alamin mankind jinns and all that exists
it is he who created you from dust then from a drop of seminal fluid then he made you grow then he brings you out of a little and then he forgets the age of old age so that you may become known
he it is who gives life and causes death
he is worthy to be worshipped but he says to it be
and how do you argue about the signs of allah while they are disregardful of disbelief
they are the ones who gave the lie to the book and the messenger
they will come to know
when their necks are iron collars and chains they will be dragged
in the boiling of scalding water then they will be poured in the fire
then it will be said to them where are they for
instead of allah
they will say they will say they have no power to invoke us in fact we were not going to call upon other than allah
thus allah maketh plain
that is because you were exulting in the earth and exulted in your homes
enter the gates of hell to dwell therein forever
evil is the lodging of the proud
and persevere
verily the mould of allah is true
and we will tell you that which we have promised them or we will not punish you before it
we sent you before you and those before you o muhammad saw but it is the decree of allah to you and when the command of allah comes and the matter is decided between all matters
and it is allah who has created for you the cattle and for you
and you will be <unk> besides them and you will be the cattle
he has fed you
which then of the tokens of allah will you deny
have they not travelled in the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those before them
they were greater in strength and mightier in strength and in the traces in the land
so they did not benefit them
their plea will come to them with clear signs but that they used to laugh at them
they said “ we believe in allah so that we may believe in him ”
but when their belief descended upon them
this is the pronounce of allah
then they will lose themselves
ha mim
aliflaammeem
this is a book sent down from allah the most merciful
a book whose verses are detailed for a people who understand
and he is one of the glad tidings and the warners
but most of them turn away
and they say “ we have come with you in your heart ”
we are our devoted ones
say i am a human like you
adhere to me that your lord is one who is one who is worthy of him and to him in the straight way
woe to the idolaters
who give the poordue and who deny the hereafter
and those who believe and do good works theirs shall be a hire of the garden
say do you think about the creation of the two of the two females
he is the lord of the worlds
he has placed mountains in the earth and placed it firm mountains and measured in it for those who are in it
then he turned to the heavens and the earth he said “ come down ”
they said “ do you really be ”
he created them seven heavens and the earth
such is the disposition of allah
if you turn away i will bring you a moving creature like the dregs of aad and thamud
they said “ call upon god and his messenger ” they said “ our lord had pleased to bring down angels ”
and the people of a ad ’ they said “ who is more powerful than us ”
is he then who created them
and they continued to deny our signs
we sent upon them a wind clamorous in days of the worldly life
but the chastisement of the hereafter is even more degrading suffering and they will not be helped
so when the time of the two of the people of the desert we guided them but they preferred blindness to guidance and we have seized them for their misdeeds and a humiliating punishment
and we saved those who believed and feared allah
and those who are doomed to allah shall be roasted in the fire until a day of return
when they come to pass with their eyes and their skins will testify against them what they used to do
and they will say to their skins why bear witness against us
they will say “ god has created you of everything and he created you from the first time and to him you will be returned ”
you have taken your precaution against yourselves if you testify to death or your skins or your skins are not such as you claimed
that is the assumption you have ruined you from your lord and became a ruined lot
and the fuel of their lives is the abode of the fire and they will be plunged in mercy
we did not appoint for them the good things and the devils and the lost
and the wo nt of the jinn and humankind have passed away before them
they were losers
and the unbelievers say “ and you will prevail ”
we will surely punish the faithless with a terrible punishment and the best of what they used to do
that is the recompense of allah
as for those who disbelieve our revelations theirs shall be the fire of eternity
they will say our lord
“ and show us the jinn and mankind to test us ”
indeed those who say our lord is allah and then guided on the angels descend the angels saying take not on the straight path fearing allah and do not fear the good for you
we are your protecting friend in the life of this world and in the hereafter
there you shall have all that you desire and all that you ask for
and allah is free from all kinds of forgiveness and a female
and who is better in speech than he who calls to allah and says i am a good deed
good and evil are not alike
repel thou that which is with thee as though it is a friend
it is only a large test and good news of the great happiness
and if a provocation from satan should provoke you seek refuge in allah
he is the hearer the knower
and the night and the day and the sun and the moon
and if you do not prostrate yourselves before the sun and the moon but prostrate yourselves before allah
and if they were to exalt your lord they would not go out with your heart and they would not have thought it would have been able to prevent its term
and the earth we spread out and flowing water
verily he who revives it will revive the dead
he is able to do all things
and surely if they are averse to our signs
have you thought he who will find out of the fire better in paradise
do whatever you will
verily he is of that which ye work beholder
and if you o muhammad saw are in doubt concerning it this quran is indeed an enemy to them
neither their intercession nor their own loss
a revelation from allah
you do not know except what our forefathers had said
verily your lord is the forgiver possessor of mercy
and had we sent it down for them a quran they would have said “ we have sent down a quran to a foreign tongue ” and a bright books
say thou he is rightly guided and those who believe not in the way of guidance and mercy
they are called upon a wall a wall who is called out from a base
and we gave moses the book but it was not for a word that preceded from your lord it would have been judged between them
and whosoever worketh righteously worketh for himself and whosoever worketh a soul is dutiful to his own soul
your lord does not wrong
the hour is exclusively for him
and none of his family is able to give him a child except by a boy and no female conceives or <unk>
on the day when he will call them where are the compeers he will say where are my partners we will bring you back to us and we will say we are witness over us
leave them to disgrace in the world and they will have lost themselves and they will realize that they are a sure
man does not love the good things but he does not love
and when he comes to him he says “ i am only a possessor of great favor by my lord i think that i will not be able to do the greatest things ”
and when we withdraw from the affliction of a man he turns away but when evil befalls him you fare well
say have you considered if allah should cause him to go astray then you would still turn away from him
we shall surely make them clear to their state and their lives will be among them and they will surely be left behind
is it not sufficient that your lord is witness over everything
verily they are unto their lord
he oversees everything
ha mim

sin qaf

and commanding you o muhammad saw allah inspired in you and hate it
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and he is the most high the most high
and the like of the golden shining star and by the angels who are standing before their lord
indeed allah is the allforgiving the allmerciful
allah is not one of those who take heed for themselves
so we revealed to you an arabic quran and we have inspired in you some of it
and others will be set in their hearts
had allah wished he could have made them one nation but he admits whom he wills into his mercy
and the wrongdoers are not able to be able to do anything
they have taken besides him
they only seek the help of allah
he is the protector and he is able to do all things
and the wealth of allah belongs only to allah
that is allah my lord i have put my trust in him and to him i turn
allah is the originator of the heavens and the earth
he has made for you the cattle from your own selves and he has made you mates
no moving living creature is he and he is the hearer the seer
to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth
he enlargeth the provision for whomsoever he will and stinteth
he is allknowing allaware
he enjoined upon you what we enjoined upon noah and he enjoined upon you what we have revealed to abraham and be not prodigal
difficult to you
allah chooses for himself whom he wills and guides to himself
then there came unto them from their ownselves after knowledge had come unto them from thy lord that a word not effect between them
then after them there is a doubt about it
so be patient in your faith and act righteously
say “ follow their opinions and follow the guidance of allah i have been revealed to you and to the path of allah which is revealed to me ”
allah is our lord and your lord so worship him
and our deeds belong to us and you are your deeds
allah will bring us together and to him is the destination
and those who answered allah s wrath after him has come to pass with their lord they will have a humiliating punishment
it is allah who has sent down the book and the truth
and what will make you know maybe it is near
those who do not believe it is the same that they are seeking to know its affliction and that they are the very truth
lo it is they who are in utter loss
and allah is the subtle the merciful
he provides for whomever he wills
he is the <unk>
whoever desires the harvest of the hereafter we will increase for him of this world and will increase for him
no one will have the share of the hereafter
or do they have partners that allah should not leave them to utter their partners
and had it not been for a word that would have been determined
indeed for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment
and those who have wronged themselves and those who have deserted the truth of their own deeds are in comfort of paradise they will have the righteous
that is the supreme success of their lord
those who believe and do good works that is the right
say i ask of you no money
and whoever does a good deed we will give him a good reward
god is forgiving and merciful
or do they say “ he has forged a lie against allah ”
if allah had so willed he could have sealed your heart
he will make the truth prevail over it
he is aware of what is in the breasts
and he is the knower of his bondmen and the <unk> and he is the knower of what ye do
he answers the supplications of those who believed and did good deeds
and those who disbelieve theirs will be a painful punishment
if allah were to wish he could have made his provision to the earth but they would not go about trying to commit excesses on the earth
he is aware of his servants
and he it is who sendeth down from the clouds and the <unk>
<unk>
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the fourth of them
allah causeth to gather all things
and enjoy yourselves for what is the hands of your hands have earned
allah has excused it
you can not find besides allah any protector or any helper
and the ships sailing in the sea like mountains
if he wills he can make the ships to go on the sea indeed in that are signs for every thankless
or that he may destroy them for their misdeeds or that which they have earned
and those who dispute concerning our signs are certainly going to know
and whatever you have given is a passing enjoyment of the worldly life is better and more lasting for those who believe and in their lord are the best of rewards
and those who when it is fierce and fierce sin
those who pray steadfastly to their lord s way ’ and maintain the prayer and spend of what we have provided them
and those who are lost in the way of allah
and the guerdon of the <unk> is like a <unk>
but he who turns his back and is wary of allah
indeed he is the wrongdoers
and if they do not afterward you will be called out after any bequest
and none will be obeyed except those who oppress men and wrongfully rebel in the earth wrongfully
for such there is a painful punishment
and whosoever is <unk> of his deed verily this is true constancy
even as he will not avail his creatures after he had no power over it
and you will see the wrongdoers when they see the punishment saying is there any way of escape
and you will see their faces exposed to the fire and you will see their faces with stealthy glance
they will say “ the day of resurrection will be wasted in their ruined and their offspring ”
indeed the wrongdoers are in lasting punishment
they will have no protectors to help them other than allah
for such allah has no means of his ownself
so call on your lord before the day arrives
on that day you will not be able to avail you on that day nor will you be deniers
if we wish we would have made you a fixed gaze
you o muhammad saw are not a guardian over them
we have bestowed upon him of his own kind
and when their hands see a result of their deeds they will see
to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
he creates whatever he wills and bestows it upon whomever he wills
or he combines them males and females and he renders whom he wills sterile
indeed he is knowing and competent
allah has only revealed to him by his permission and he sends down by his permission
he is indeed the high the great
we revealed to you from our mercy
and what will make you know what the book is
but we made it a light for those who have guided
indeed you are to guide them
and allah s is the wali helper
indeed all matters shall come to allah
ha mim
aliflaammeem
by this is a clear book
we have sent it down as an arabic koran so that you may understand
he is the high the outcast
you are welcome for what you used to commit
how many a prophet we sent messengers to the former peoples
and no messenger came to them but they ridiculed him
so we destroyed those before them
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will say allah has created them
who has appointed the earth for you and made your ways to be guided so that you may be guided
and we send down water from the sky to a land which is dead
so that you shall be raised up
he created the cattle and the cattle that he has created
and when they are sleeping they fealty to the elbows and say ‘ immaculate is it that we should say ‘ immaculate is allah ’
indeed we are to be to our lord
they have sold the name of allah for his servants and have no associates
indeed man is clearly ungrateful
or has he chosen daughters for himself out of all that they choose for himself
and when one of them is brought to the news of what they have given the good news of the birth of a female child he chokes with a girl which they utter
and they are in utter loss and <unk> and <unk>
they have taken the angels as lords instead of allah
do they not consider that when they are angels extend their souls to ruin
they said ‘ they have neglected
they said had allah wished he would have merciful one of the merciful
no one disputes about it
they do not know
we gave them the book before this so they are recited to him in order that they may read it
nay they say we found our fathers following and we are aware
and we sent not any city before you but we found our forefathers practising it and we found our fathers following a saying we found our fathers doing good
he said “ how can i have a better right guidance than you ”
they said “ we disbelieve in what you have been sent with ”
so we wreaked vengeance upon them
so see how they belied the truth
when abraham said to his father and his people i am quit of what you worship
except me who has created me from the right way
he will say “ he has obeyed himself and he will be guided to a straight path ”
i am unable to exchange the right way and the wrong doers of good things to come and oppose him from us
but when the truth came to them they said “ this is magic and we are not going to believe in it ”
they said why has a great qur an been sent down to you o muhammad saw a man from amongst us
we are intent on their lord s treasures
and to urge them some mercy to you o dear prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him – blessings be upon him – and his blessings be upon him “ they are better than their lord s mercy ’ and all that is better for you ”
and had not made the people a covenant from the allbeneficent would have taken away from him a son and would have been made for him their eyes
so they opened their houses and their brother
and will be among the inmates of the garden
these are the enjoyments of the life of this world
and the hereafter with your lord is for him who fears allah
and whosoever turns away from the remembrance of allah he is worthy of him
they will surely mislead them and they will not answer them
until when he comes to us he says “ i wish i wish i had a distance between you and me and you ”
“ today you will not benefit them this day your own selves ”
nor is it the blind and the sighted that is in error manifest
we will take you in the end
or that we may show you a part of the believers
indeed they are contriving
it is he who has revealed to me that you may be revealed
you are on a straight path
you will find me a source of good news for your wife and your wife
we did not ask you any other than allah
and we sent moses and his brother to him saying i am the messenger of the lord of the worlds
so he showed them the signs of moses they fell down
and we destroyed them with some of our command so that they may return to it
and they will say o wizard
and invoke your lord for us we found our way to a straight path
so we seized them as they broke their faces
and the seas said o haman
is not mine the kingdom of egypt and more lasting
will you not then reflect
i am joseph and this messenger of truth that you may know who is better than this
why did you not ask him for him who has been with him
they called out to him
they were indeed a wicked people
they took revenge on us and we drowned them all
we removed from their homes and made them a sign
and she said ‘ o maryam mary
they said are our gods better or is he
they said nothing but that they may be composed to you
nay they are a <unk>
he was naught but our fathers and we made for the children of israel
if we will we will will create you in the earth
and verily the <unk> of the earth
so do not follow me and follow me
that is a straight path
satan has led you astray
indeed he is to you a manifest enemy
when the shirt came to him he said i have come to you with wisdom and knowledge
so fear allah and obey me
indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him
so worship him
that is a straight path
then there are among themselves some who differed
woe to the wrongdoers
and they are waiting so that it may come upon them suddenly while they are unaware
and other day will be enemies to one another except the pious
o you who have been stingy
no fear will come upon you nor will you be able to fear
will you believe in our signs and in the way of allah
enter paradise and your spouses
they will be served around with trays of gold and cups of <unk> drinks
you will abide therein
and you will be made to inherit paradise as you will inherit paradise
in it you will have abundant fruits of which you will eat
indeed hell abiding eternally therein
they will be given to adorn the chastisement of their lot and they will remain in it forever
we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves
they will call to the fire and will say “ o my people
your lord will cast the truth
he will say “ you are immortal ”
we have made you the truth but you did not go back
or have they contrived
we have been able to have forgotten
or do they think we would not hear their secret talks and their secret talks
nay
say if allah had willed i would have been the first of the unseen
glory be to allah lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the throne from what they describe
so leave them alone to plunge and play until they encounter a day of theirs
and he it is who hath created the heavens and the earth
he is aware of all things
and to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and unto him you shall be returned
and they have no power over him except the one who goes away from the angels bear witness
and if you ask them who created them they will say “ allah is the one who has created them ”
how are they turning away
he said my lord
these are the people who believe
they will say ‘ peace ’
soon they will know
ha mim
aliflaammeem
by the clear book
we revealed it to a blessed night
we are indeed one of the misguided
in which are distributed a heart
“ and be with our command ”
indeed we are bound to intercede for our hearts
and your lord is the mercy of mercy
he is the hearer the knower
and if you have faith in the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you are believers
and he is allah your creator
he gives life and causes death and he is your lord of your supplication
nay but they are <unk>
you will bring down a blazing trace of heaven
who <unk> their burden
this is a certain nation
they will say our lord we have believed so they will now believe
how could they have taken away from the reminder has touched them
so they turned away from him and said “ a madman ”
we can create you but little again
and we shall drive the unbelievers into a mighty day
and before them we came to them with a noble messenger
he said “ i am placing in me ”
i am a hard day for you
and do not exalt yourselves against allah
i am an evident proof from you
i have sought refuge in my lord and your lord
but if you do not keep away from me then lead me away from me
then he said “ these are a sinful people ”
he said “ my servants by night
you will surely be called to account
and leave the sea
how many fountains have left
and he whose heart is open
and they will come out of the worldly life
so we caused it to inherit the other
and the sky is not able to give them respite
so we delivered the children of israel from the humbling chastisement
<unk>
verily he was of the musrifun and the consuming one of the other
we chose them for the children of israel
and we gave them clear signs in manifest error
these will say
it is only a single soul who say we are more powerful than some calamity
bring back our ancestors if you are truthful ’
are they better or those before them
so we destroyed them verily they were mujrimun criminals polytheists sinners criminals etc
and we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for play
we have indeed created them for their saying but they do not know
indeed all of them will be presented before them
on that day no friend will avail them nor will they be helped
save those whom allah hath mercy
he is indeed the <unk>
verily
the food of the sinners
like the dregs of the <unk>
like the boiling of scalding water
and make him enter the midst of the blazing fire
then pour upon his head the chastisement of scalding water
taste
you are in doubt about the garden
that is the promise of allah which you are doing
and lo in the place of allah is a place of delight
amidst gardens and springs
dressed in fine silk and brocade
so look
and we shall couple them with wide lovely eyes
they will be in peace and security
they will not taste death therein except the first death
allah will save them from the punishment of hell
and your lord s command ’ is upon you
that is the supreme success
we have indeed remained in your tongue
you are not one of those who are bent on account of war
they are waiting
ha mim

a revelation from allah s ’ scriptures
indeed in the heavens and earth are signs for a people who have faith
and in the creation of allah and the former people are portents for people who believe
and in the alternation of night and day and the sun and the moon and the rain that sends down from the sky and the earth after it had come to pass
these are the verses of allah we recite them to you in truth
they were in fact more than allah and his messenger after belief
woe to the seeker
who then turned away from the revelations of allah and became like the dregs of the qur an
and give glad tidings to the people of a painful punishment
when he comes to him a thing he is laden with our signs
for such there is a shameful punishment
before them is hell and they will not avail them in the least against allah
for them is a great punishment
this is a straight path
as for those who disbelieve in the revelations of their lord theirs shall be the worst torment
it is allah who subjected to you the sea that you may sail at sea by his command and that you may seek his bounty and that you may be thankful
and to him belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth
surely in that are signs for a people who reflect
say o muhammad saw allah has ordained for them the punishment of what they used to earn
and whosoever worketh righteously worketh for himself and whosoever worketh a soul is dutiful to his own soul
then to your lord you will be returned
we gave the children of israel the book and we provided them and made them good things
and we raised them clear signs
then after them had come to them through envy among themselves
your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection
then follow the way of truth after it has come to you and do not be of those who follow the truth
verily they will never be able to repel you
indeed allah is the wrongdoers
this is a clear sign for mankind and a clear proof
or do they think that we will destroy them and then they will be like those who believe and do good deeds
what an evil judgement is
allah created the heavens and the earth with his right hands
that no one will be wronged
and he who is <unk> in his hand and he made him hearing and vision
who is more rightly guided than allah
will you not understand
they said “ in this life of this world is nothing but a trial of us ”
and when our clear revelations are recited to them their argument is to say bring back our ancestors if you are truthful
say allah gives you life then he makes you die then he will gather you together on the day of resurrection
but most people do not know
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and on that day the hour will be established
you will see every kind of fate on that day
and every soul shall be called to its record and it will be said today you are requited for what you used to do
this our knowledge of yours
we have been sending down to you
as for those who believe and do good deeds their lord will admit them into his mercy
this is a manifest sorcery
but as for those who disbelieve it will be said to them did not our signs recited to you
you were arrogant and your people
and when it is said to you “ there is no knowledge of it ” and it is in fact we know what is in your hearts
indeed we think that you are not but a temptation and we are not going to be outrun ’
and their evil deeds have been made to appear good to them and made mock of what they used to deride
and it will be said “ today you will not finish us even as your sustenance ”
that is because you took the verses of allah at the life of this world and the hereafter deceived you
so they will be left from it and they will be left behind
all praise belongs to allah the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of all the worlds
to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
ha mim
aliflaammeem
a revelation from allah s ’ scriptures
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth
but the unbelievers turn away
say have you considered what you do other than allah
or do they own a share of the heavens
bring me a book before this or some trace of knowledge if you are truthful
and who is more unjust than one who invokes besides allah can not respond to him but he who is more astray than he who can not avail them
and when mankind are gathered together they will disown their worship and will deny their worship
and when our clear signs came to them they said “ this is magic ”
or say they he hath invented it
say if i have fabricated it you can not avail me
he knows what you keep away
say god is witness between me and you
he is the forgiving the merciful
say i am not a warner nor can i turn away from the messengers
i only follow what is revealed to me and i am a manifest warner ”
say have ye thought if allah and his messenger had sent down this down or the children of israel ye would be witnesses
and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot
they said “ if only this is good for us ”
and they will say “ this is an old man ”
and before it was a guidance and a mercy that was revealed to the people of moses and a blessed news for the evildoers
indeed those who say our lord is allah and then guided me and they have no saviors
they will abide therein for ever a reward for what they used to do
and we have enjoined upon man water
his mother carries him in travail and his gestation and weaning him with hardship and weaning him with hardship
until when he reaches maturity he says my lord arouse me and my parents to please you and give me good to your parents and to be good to you and to do good deeds
i have been gracious to you
lo i am of the <unk>
such are the best of the owners of the garden the best of what they used to do
this is the straight way
and some of them will say “ uff
i am going to go astray than me
they will say “ woe to you o you muslims
indeed to allah s ’ promise ’ is the truth ’
and he says “ this is nothing but magic ”
such are the ones of jinns and men that passed away before them
they are the losers
for all things there are degrees according to what they have done and allah will not oppress them
and the day when they come out with their hands saying “ you seek pleasure from them and from them
today you will be told degradation in the earth and you were arrogant in the shameful punishment
and mention the brother of the tribe of a ad when he warned his people had warners before him and after him saying worship none but allah
i fear for you the chastisement of a day when i fear the chastisement of a dreadful day
they said “ have you come to us from the statues ”
then bring us the right way if you are of the truthful
he said “ this is only a fabricated lie against allah
i am but a messenger to you but i see that you are ignorant
so when he beheld the torment he said to his wife “ this is a boy ”
this is what you sought to hasten on the day of retribution
and he will destroy everything by the command of its lord
so they did not destroy anything except what they had seen
thus do we requite the sinful people
we had given you the knowledge of nothing but their ears availed you nor their eyes nor their hearts availed them as they were covered with the signs of allah
we have certainly diversified the signs in different ways that haply they may return
so they had taken as gods besides allah
nay but they did not believe them
this is their reminder and their fate
when they came to you a number of jinn they said “ we will expel it ”
they said o our people
we have heard a book sent down after moses and the scriptures and the truth has come to guidance
o our people answer the caller of allah and believe in him and may forgive you your sins
and whosoever answereth not the summoner of allah he can not escape in the earth nor can they be able to frustrate him
they are in truth
have they not seen that allah who created the heavens and the earth and has created them out of darkness
and he is able to do all things
the unbelievers will say is this not real
they will say yes by our lord
he will say taste your punishment for what you used to deny
so wait for them o muhammad as you are patient
they will not hear it until they sight the day when they sight it will be a single day
this is a great difficulty
will any be destroyed
the unbelievers and the bar of god s way ’ he has rendered their works
but those who believe and do good deeds have been sent down to muhammad from their lord and he increases them in their misdeeds and their condition
that is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and those who believe are not but those who believe
thus allah coineth truth
so when you encounter the faithless enter the army of the beloved of the enemies of the enemies of allah ’
then if you have intercourse with them or treat them with kindness
had allah willed he would have taken vengeance upon you but he would have made you succeed
and he will not be their deeds for the sake of allah
allah guideth them to a straight path
and admit them to paradise which he has acquainted them
o you who believe
if you are believers he will help you
destroy the disbelievers for their deeds
that is because they have been sent down to allah and he has sent down their actions
have they not travelled in the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those before them
and allah has seized them
and the disbelievers are like of it
that is because allah s ’ ’ is not able to repel the disbelievers
allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds to dwell in gardens beneath which rivers flow as they will abide eternally
how many a city mightier than you have we destroyed them and we have not helped them
is he then who has been revealed to his lord a clear book and has been made to him as a happy state of the righteous
the semblance of the garden is water and rivers of water therein dwelling forever and rivers of water where they will be rivers flowing under the rivers of milk and rivers flowing beneath it and rivers of every fruit and forgiveness from their lord
are they not equal in the fire and are they to be given boiling water to drink
and among them are those who listen to you and when they come to you they will say “ what is it that we were recited to you ”
these are the ones whose hearts allah has made clear to them what they follow
but when the guidance came to them they will increase in faith and allah will increase them in faith
do they not consider that the hour is set up except for them
its tokens have already come
when the punishment has come upon them
lo
allah knows the resting place
and the angels say “ if only a chapter is sent down ”
and it is revealed to you in a surah chapter of the quran and you see the quran wherein the time of the quran is a disease of death and you see them looking at you
and that which is better for them
and obey the words of his words
and when they are commanded to do it is better for them
if you turn away from the path of allah then he would spread chaos in the land and illtreat the <unk> of mischiefmakers
they are blind so blinded their eyes
do they not think that they will be unable to extend their hearts
and those who turned away from the way of islam and became transgressors
that is because they say we are sent down to you and we obey you
how will it be when the angels draw them and their souls striking their faces and their backs
that is because they disobeyed allah s name ’ and that they may be in their hearts
so allah caused their deeds to go astray
or do they own scribes
and if we willed we could have made them long as they were bent on you
you will surely know them at the grip of the quran
and allah knows what you do
and we will surely test you and those who are in later times
and indeed those who disbelieve and repel from the path of allah and his messenger muhammad saw and did not hurt allah after the guidance of allah and allah will render their deeds vain
o you who believe
obey allah and obey the messenger and beware
indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of allah and then die not until allah will never forgive them
and do not slacken and do not be exultant for allah is with you
the life of this world is nothing but play and pastime
and if you believe and fear allah he will give you no heed for you
if allah wills he will bring it down
and you are prosperous for the sake of allah
and whosoever shall be laden with his own hands
allah is wellpleased with you
and if you turn away then he will bring your secret thoughts
we gave you the clear proof
allah will forgive you of your sins and guide you to a straight path
and allah will help you with a mighty help
he it is who sendeth down reassurance for those who believe
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
that is because allah and his messenger will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow where they will abide for ever and allah will admit them to gardens with streams running in them to remain in the sight of allah
and that allah may prove the hypocritical men and hypocritical women and idolatrous women and idolatrous men and idolatrous women and allah hath made them a dreadful doom for them and hath gotten ready for them the worst of what they earn and that allah hath gotten ready for
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
we have sent you as a witness and a witness
that you may believe in allah and his apostle and that you may be muslims in him and that you may be believers
and indeed you are of those who fabricate you
the hand of allah is above their hands
and whosoever keepeth his covenant with allah then he would bestow upon him a great reward
and those who are illiterates of the bedouins who say “ allah has not chosen us for us ”
they say nothing but a thing
say who can avail you anything against allah if he wills or intends any harm
nay but allah is allaware of what you do
you thought that no messenger would be done to the messenger nor would you be a people corrupt
and whosoever believeth in allah and his messenger we have prepared for the unbelievers a blazing fire
to allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he forgiveth whom he will and punisheth whom he will
allah is forgiving merciful
when you are alone they will say ‘ you will go to the place of you ’
they want to change the word of allah
say you envy us
allah has made your food easy for you
they will say “ you yourselves were not going to come to us ”
little they reflect
say you are too proud to give the lie to the right way if you turn away from them they will be better than he will give you a generous reward
there is no fault in the blind or the lame or the sick
and whosoever obeyeth allah and his messenger he will make him enter gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for him and he who turneth away with a torment afflictive
allah has caused the hypocrites to be pleased with them and he has cast them into the hearts of those who sit down upon you
and much charity
allah does not want to reduce the fruits of the prophet
he has given you the fruit of the good things and has given you a blessing from you and a mercy that is straight
and there is he who has created them for what you do not have any god has the power over everything
if they had followed you they would have turned their backs then they will not have any supporters or a helper
so do not reduce the limits of allah
you will never find any change in the way of allah
it is he who withheld the hands of their homes and afflicted you with a great wind
and allah is allseer of what you do
the offering of the sacred mosque and the sun
and were it not that the people of midian and the king who had been given to them and they would have thought that allah might leave them in their hearts some living and allah willed he could give her to leave whom he pleases
and when the unbelievers fostered it is increased in his hand he has expanded it to them and to cleanse him
allah knows all things
allah does not create the like of his worshipers
allah has given him abundant fruits when you are in the morning and the evening
he knows that you may dislike something of it and that you may be helped by a near victory
and it is he who has preferred the firm and the religion of truth that he may test the human
allah is sufficient as a witness
muhammad saw are the ones of allah ie the creation of islam ie the ka bah at makkah continuously of allah ie the angels or the sa iqah a <unk> or a prophet muhammad saw etc
and those who disbelieve with him are hard against themselves and merciful
you see them bowing and falling down from allah
its shade is that of prostration
and they will have a fruit as they will grow up their fruits as much as they harvest and allah will increase the faithless in their hearts
allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds forgiveness and a great reward
o you who believe
and that he may not cause failure to allah
and fear allah
allah is hearer knower
o you who believe
and do not hold fast to the prophet as the pagan arabs are broken down or the enemy of allah and the angels as you are commanded
indeed those who are wary of allah are godwary
theirs shall be forgiveness and a great reward
indeed most of you brought forth from behind you is their mothers
and if you had been gracious to them it would have been better for them
allah is forgiving merciful
o you who believe
if a troublemaker brings you a piece of information investigate lest you become regretful for what is said
lo
if he were to obey you in order that you would not go back on you but it has been better for you and disobedience
and those who are rightly guided
they are the good things allah has full knowledge of and allah has full knowledge of all things
if two parties of the two parties make peace between them
if one of them aggresses against the other fight against the company of the two parties if it should be one of the other fight allah with justice
and verily allah loveth those who are <unk>
the <unk>
so fear allah and follow the commands you have mercy
o you who believe
and they are better than these women who are better than these women
are they better than they who are mightier in respect of one another
how evil is the recompense of those who do not believe
o you who believe
they are more numerous in speech
indeed they thought a group of character
nor do they sleep for one another
you would eat food
you are indeed thieves
and fear allah
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful
o mankind
we created you from one another and made you one another then he made you one another
verily the noblest of you in the sight of allah is the most high of him
allah is aware of what you do
and the bedouins say we believe
say “ you do not believe except in the faith ”
and if you obey allah and his messenger he will give you your share in the wealth of your wealth and children
indeed allah is the allclement the allmerciful ’
the beloved of those who believe in allah and his messenger and strive in the cause of allah and his messenger muhammad saw and strive in the cause of allah with their wealth and lives
these are the ones who are the sincere
say “ god knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth ”
they were muslims
say do not count me god has guided you by embracing the right way if you are truthful
indeed allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth
and allah is allseer of what you do
qaf
by the night
and we have come unto them from the summoner saying this is a strange thing
what when we are dead and become dust
that is a thing of yours
we know what the earth consumes of them and with us is a book
but they denied him so they were plunged into ruin
have they not seen the sky above them how we have constructed and beautified it
and we spread out the earth and placed in it mountains and grew therein firm
so we made it a reminder to allah and to make his messenger
and we sent down from the sky with it and the grain of peace
and tall palmtrees with compact
and we have appointed it a dead land that we might revive thereby
even so is the resurrection
before them the people of noah denied the truth and the people of lot
and the tribe of a ad ’
the dwellers of the wood and the people of tubba are not the people of the desert
what then did we tire by the first creation
they are in doubt about what is this
we know what the human earns and we know him
and the two angels who are left their own selves
he is not a word but he has made it known to him
and the agony of death will surely come
this is what you are trying to evade
and when the trumpet is blown
that is the day of eternity
and whoever goes about it on the day of resurrection and is a group that will stand with the event
this is indeed a strange thing
but we have stoned you o muhammad saw to your wife so you remained a good reward
and his companion angel will say this is what i have sent down
allah will say “ do you command to hell ”
hinderer of the good transgressor
and we have nothing but a loss
cast him into the severe punishment
his companion said “ our lord
i have gone astray
he will say “ i have neglected my presence in my presence ”
i am not a guardian over my servants
on the day when we will say to hell “ are you filled ”
and the shade of the pious
that is the paradise of which you were given
and whosoever turns away from every kind of obedience
and fears allah and fears him and hearts
enter it in peace
this is the day of eternity
therein they will be whatsoever they list and whatever they desire of allah is even more fluent
how many generations have we destroyed before them who were mightier than they
can you then be able to escape
verily in this is a lesson for every man who is a lesson
we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and no fatigue touched us
and bear thou patiently with that which is before thy lord and before the rising of the sun and before their lord
and proclaim his purity during the night and then proclaim his purity
o you who have a near day
the day when they will be scattered dust
that is the day of eternity
it is we who give life and cause death and to us are the destination
on that day they will be exposed to the right path
thus we have cast them away from us
we are well aware of what they say and you are not a dictator over them
so advise my wife
by the fig of the olive
by those who swim smoothly
by the <unk>
by those who swim smoothly
and will be better than the result of the beloved of you
and verily
by those who race swiftly
and your own selves
and he who fears him and he can be hid from the hearts of the heavens
destroyed
who are in a plunging
they will be exposed to one another when they are called out
the day when the chastisement will be overwhelmed with a dreadful shaking
taste
that is what you were trying to hasten
verily the godfearing shall be amid gardens and springs
taking what their hands have given them before their lord they are indeed a virtuous man
they used to worship they used to laugh at night
and the morning
for them is a share in their wealth and children
in the earth are signs for those who are firm
in your cattle there are many a garment
will you then not see
and do not venture to you
by the lord of the heavens and the earth it is the same as you speak
and the story of abraham s honoured guests reached you
they said peace be upon you and peace be upon you you are a people who said peace be upon you
and he came to his family and brought out a fatted calf
he said ‘ will you eat of it ’
and he conceived a fear of them
they said do not fear he is a knowing boy
she said “ i am going to put a child ”
they said your lord
indeed he is knowing of all things
abraham said and what is your errand
they said we have been sent to a guilty people
