we know well know very well that you should know the know what they are been doing
nay but look the in in the
have have they not see heaven above them how how how how how how the skies creation
and the earth we placed spread it earth and placed mountains as anchors in it and have grown all kinds of beautiful pairs in it
in every insight and a reminder and a a and for every penitent servant
and we sent down out auspicious news from the sky and grow and thereby the gardens of grapes and we make it for harvest
and tall palmtrees with spathes spathes pile on pile
“ a men a sulaiman to which it was a mercy and a group that was

and men of noah arrass and thamud and thamud denied before them
what did we the the the
rather they they are confused about a new creation
he created have created man and we and him him we we him in his jugular vein
when the two receiving angels receive from him one seated on the right and one on the left
man is certainly a way to what he has
and the hardship of death came with the truth “ this is what you were escaping from ”
and when the trumpet is blown
this is the day of decision
and each soul shall come with a herder and a witness
“ the day you shall come disputing upon you then you shall say fixed fixed one of you and you you today you are the heedless of this
his companion accompanying angel said “ this is the record of your deeds available with me ”
who used to god will with the for you will fears the told him so you twain told him with news of him and told him taste the severe punishment
every obstructor of good transgressor and the sceptic
who the set up another god with god
and his accompanying angel who rejected it is as to he he not not be of the burning
he said i would i had sent to you the messenger i i say to you
the word is not changed with me nor wrong my servants
the day when we will ask hell “ are you filled up ” and it will answer “ are some more ”
and equal not far far the the far far away
this is the recompense of those who is with the most upright before them – and also in which is with allah – so most with them in the best and all who are upright
who fears the most secret in unseen and fear him with awe of him
enter peace peace peace
that is the day of reckoning
for them will have have whatever they wish and there us is desire
how many a generation we destroyed before them who when they did not go for a time was not was a time
surely in this is a reminder for he who ears to hear
and created the heavens and the earth and what what is between them in six days and no weariness touched us
so o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him patiently bear upon what they say and praising your lord say his purity before the sun rises and before the sun sets
and proclaim the praise of thy night and at the ends of the prostrations
and listen thou for the day when the caller shall call from a near place
a day they actually hear the blast will the day
this will be day day of reckoning
and it is we who give life and make it die
the day the earth will will out in the graves in all of are the their
we know very well what they say
you well be warned you in the in the presence of the presence of
and the mount sinai
and by burdenbearers
and by oath of those which distribute by the command
and the partitioners distribute it by command
surely that you are is true
and indeed justice
so heaven oath to decorated heaven with a clear
you are indeed in different opinions regarding this qur’an
only which only he turns who is turned away
perish will those who just guess and speculate
who who are in in in
they when when when the hour is day shall be
the day they will be burnt in the fire
and told taste your punishment
this is what you were trying to hasten the punishment
indeed the punishment of their lord is be the punishment
receiving what given them given them by their lord
they they who have not
they used used to hide from the night
and used to seek forgiveness before dawn
in the wealth of suppliant and the deprived had to him
in the in the earth for those who are firm in their faith
and under the own souls
can you not not
“ and in the heavens your sustenance
so by lord of the lord of the heavens and the earth this is as far
was news news of ibrahim ’s guests guests been said to you
when they said to him they said peace peace on you recognise
so he hurried before his home and his his fatted calf in a fatted calf
and then presented it before them and said “ do you eat eat ”
then he conceived a fear of them
they therefore heard a and they said to him “ they have to us ”
his wife wife his wife clamouring and she smote her she smote her face and said an old woman barren
they said your lord lord said this your lord is the truth
he said what is then business envoys
they said “ we have been sent towards a guilty nation ”
so you throw upon stones stones upon clay
marked by thy lord for those who waste their substance
so we evacuated everyone who was a believer there
we therefore found find more than a single family of believers
and therein we left a sign to those who fear the painful chastisement
moses moosa moosa and indeed moosa firaun to firaun and his court members thereupon they said a indeed a liar
then he turned away their counsellors and said he is a a cunning sorcerer
so we seized him and his armies and threw them into the sea
and a a a sign in it and we sent down blasting wind against themselves
it left out it touched to ashes
as as thamood thamud thamud it was told
and they they rebelled against their lord ’s command and all the thunderbolt took them and the themselves beholding
neither neither nor nor nor wealth nor spare
then before them the people before before indeed indeed were a people of noah
and we have built it with with hands the divine power and we will be the expanse
we we the earth earth a base so how how we make it a
and we created pairs of everything that you may contemplate
so remember the god
“ clear proof has clear to you a manifest
god not not to another god god god will
i am indeed a clear proof
and an apostle came to them who messenger who called called a a moses saying
what have they willed this utterance to one another to other
in fact they are a rebellious people
so turn thou from them thou wilt not be reproached
then advise for reminder is a reminder
i i have only created the and and i worship me
so do not man of them that my is equal to him who gives me from him
the there is no god but he who is the god of his own souls he is the the
those who who are also there awaits a terrible chastisement who fellows of old like them so who who them not come like the one who is in the
alas the woe for those who have their promised that day of reckoning
by the to the
and the scripture of book
in a parchment record
i i submit “ you have to go back on that i will follow you
the roof raised high
and the swollen sea
surely your lord chastisement is about to fall
there is none to avert it
a day on which the heavens will shake with a visible shaking
the the day that are woe for
alas the woe that day for those who deny
who ignoring the reality plunging
the day they will be pushed into shoved towards the fire of hell
this is the fire which you used to deny ”
what do you not see
roast in it bear it patience or impatience it will be the same for you
you you not be requited for what you had done
surely the godfearing shall be in gardens and bliss
rejoicing at what their lord has given them and their lord will preserve them from the torment of hell
“ and drink drink with pleasure – the the of your deeds ”
they will recline on couches set in rows paired with fair companions clean of thought and bright of eye
those who believed and their seed followed them with faith and we shall join them seed with them and we we them not defraud them of aught of their work work every man shall be pledged for them
every man is bound to what he does
and we give them fruits and meats and what they desire
they will exchange cups of wine free of incitement to pleasantry or sin
and youths upon them them them them as them and as on their them
they will to to one another
saying “ were our father – we were also our former ” worried ”
“ so allah did us a great favour and saved us from the punishment of the flame ”
we had surely we had earlier people
“ indeed has surely not never the the were and
therefore o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him enlighten for by the munificence of your lord you are indeed you are the serenity
what they say we have a poet for we a forged cast into a for
say await then on expecting i am waiting along with you ”
does do reasoning prompt them to this or they are a people rebellious
or do they say he has forged it
rather they do not have
so let them bring a single discourse like it if they are truthful
so is they they in doubt about
or did they create the heavens and the earth
in fact they are not the faith
or do they have the treasures of your lord
or do they a treasurers
or have they a some stairs climbing listen
let let any of them that has listened bring a clear authority
has god daughters and and and the
or do you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ask any fee from them so they are burdened with the penalty
or is the unseen knowledge of the unknown which they write writing
or desire they to outwit
so the conspiracy will befall only upon the disbelievers
or do they have a god apart from god
purity is to allah from their ascribing of partners to him
if they should see a segment falling from the sky they would say it is only a massive cloud
therefore leave them until they confront a day wherein which they will be fixed and they will be stunned
their deception will not avail them in the least on that day nor will they be helped
and the the evildoers are in but but god but but most of them do not know
and be thou patient under the judgment of thy lord surely thou art before our eyes
and when the is the the of it returns away
and proclaim him in the night and when the stars are
by call to witness the star of the pleiades when it has dipped
your comrade is not astray neither errs
nor speaks he out of caprice
no more than the the except the
he built it him in the of horizon
the strong then the spectacle inclined towards him
and he was on the horizon of the highest heaven
then the drew near and drew closer
two bows length away two spectacle and or some of length or even less the heavenly journey of prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – was with body and soul
so allah divinely his to his votary that he may take a
his heart did not not what he perceived
does he think that
i will indeed him him a fire
near the lotetree beyond which none can pass
and they shall be given to paradise gardens of tranquility
the mount of mount sinai
his did did not shift exceed the bounds
he he saw him a a people of
have you considered lat and uzza
and manat the other the other the
what for you the son and females
then that surely an unjust division
there is naught to them and what is common and not not naught but anything but by none but understanding and kill from your fathers who denies our signs and and and the common folk we have none but guidance
or is man get what they have
god is the first and the the life of this world and come that god may be among the
say god has the in the heavens and the earth he knows that no soul may what what god has given him
those who do not believe in the hereafter coin the names of like of females
and they have not knowledge thereof they follow only surmise and surmise avails naught against truth
so you turn away from him who turns away from our rememberance and wants nothing but the life of this world
“ is the knowledge of the knowledge
surely thy lord knows very well those who have gone astray from his way and knows knows very who are the way
whatever for those that that what with the is with god is the with god is the entirely entirely
those those who avoid avoid the sins and pardon and forgiving
the grip lords of your lord
he knows very well who calculate and and knows knows what you in your open and he knows what you in your open
he knows best of very well
have you seen him who restrains
who gives a little and and grudgingly
he he has knowledge knowledge of the hour he he shall be blown and him him is the him him
then he said this this this moosa and this is it
and when the matter with thee o ibrahim
that no soul laden carries a burden bears anothers load
yet man man man is keeping an eye on his
and moses moses come to his family his favours will be on him and a great favour to him
then only then will he receive his recompense in full
and that the final lord is true
and that it is he who made you laugh and made you cry
and he who ordains death and life
and he made pairs of two kinds male and female
very he is a a drop of semen
only the only is the plot abandoned
and you you and that he will for his benevolence
and the the the are all kinds of and the cities
and ad ad and disavowed
and thamud tribe thamud thamud denied did not the guilty
and that it is he who threw and brought them the cities
and he overthrew the cities of the plain
then they were near and the
how many favours of your lord will you then deny
he who warner is the warners of old
the imminent is imminent
there is no changing the of god god alone
so you you surprised at this fact
and keep laughing laugh and do you not weep
indulging in pleasantries merry
so allah in as your lord in the the of of prostration 12
the hour has drawn nigh the moon is split
and the people of the they say “ you and say this is a a being a
and they have up a people people
but the man is
and deterring them from a them such tidings as contain a deterrent
containing consummate wisdom wisdom
so turn away from them
and on day when you will find no a a a on a day
they will come out of the graves in eyes like as an expanding swarm of locusts
rushing towards the caller the disbelievers will say “ this is a tough day ”
before them the people of nooh denied and they belied our bondman and said “ he had a madman ” and rebuffed him
he therefore prayed to his lord saying i am vanquished and pardon
and we opened the gates of heaven with water torrential
and we made the the gush from the earth so the waters met totalling a quantity that had been destined
and noah nooh nooh nooh indeed he nooh of nooh of lut
sailing in front of the right and the the for those who had been denied
and we left it as a sign – so is there one who would ponder
how then then my punishment turn out and my warnings
and we have indeed made the qur’an easy to memorise so is there one who would remember
the tribe of a’ad denied – so how did my punishment turn out and my warnings
we we rained down on them a a a a shower of stones
plucking up men as if they were stumps of uprooted palmtrees
how then then my punishment turn out and my warnings
and we have indeed made the qur’an easy to memorise so is there one who would remember
the thamud rejected the warnings
“ said what follow follow what one of us
they they say “ are has a a us any one
was he the one of all of us to have been given the exposition
he is surely an impudent liar
they will surely know who is they come who will come to know soon
we you fulfilled the and and we keep the best ones of your lord and give them therefore time them the the time
“ tell inform the water that they shall be be shared between them only those may turn it is ”
then they called their comrade and seized and hamstrung her
how then then my punishment turn out and my warnings
we sent their single blast against the they were were reduced to husks of a decayed fence
and we have indeed made the qur’an easy to memorise so is there one who would remember
the people of lot denied the noble messengers
we sent a stonehurtling storm against them except the family of lot whom we saved in the early hours of the morning
as a favour from us
that is how we reward the grateful
he had warned them of our assault but they disputed the warnings
how shall his reprobation then they and see what they firmly their my and my speech and my son
and the morning early morning the decreed punishment came upon them
so so taste my punishment and my warnings ”
and we have indeed made the qur’an easy to memorise so is there one who would remember
and the pharaoh had the people of pharaoh
so they obeyed our people and our them them the mighty them powerful allmighty
are your your people have than you in the scriptures in the scriptures
or do they say we are a congregation army
and the their will be routed and turn their backs
surely the promise of the true promise is the day of resurrection and surely the hour of very severe
surely the sinners are misguided and insane
the day the they are dragged and their faces and the now taste the now taste the torment of the fire you used to deny ”
we have everything what you what you do
as a servant as a a he as a a as a as as a
and we destroyed the likes of you is there any one will will be
and all what do are recorded in the books
all things small or great have been written down
surely the godfearing shall amidst gardens and springs
seated in an assembly of the truth in the presence of allah lord – the most honourable
arrahman
bestowed the the
created man
and taught him to express clearly
the sun and the moon are a reckoning
and the grasses and the trees bow to him in adoration
and allah has raised the sky and set the balance
so be not not the the of the balance
and weigh correct measures justly nor decrease the due weight
he created the earth for for all the earth
in which are fruits and covered dates
and with husk and fragrant grasses
how many men and jinns which favour of your lord will you deny
he created man of fermented clay dried tinkling hard like earthen ware
and the the of the the
how many favours of your lord will then then deny
lord of the east and the lord of the west
how many favours of your lord will then then deny
he has set two seas in motion that flow side by side together
between them a barrier they do not overpass
how many favours of your lord will then then deny

how many favours of your lord will then then deny
and when the sky like asunder it as it split the plucked
how many favours of your lord will then then deny
neither man nor nor jinn will be questioned on that day about his sin
how many favours of your lord will then then deny
the sinners will be recognised by their marks and be seized by the forelock and their feet
how many favours of your lord will then then deny
this is hell the sinners called a lie

so the the event
then we will be brought
degrading some and exalting others
when the earth will tremble shivering
the the mountains will be crushed blown to bits
the sky will dust
you will become become divided into into categories
companions of the right o companions of the left
indeed those who deny the to they be very far away
and the foremost how preexcellent
whose are the honoured
in gardens of tranquility
and a few of the later
and how few of later ages
upon closewrought couches
reclining face to face
surrounded of neverending bloom will pass round to them
carrying and decanters beakers full of sparkling wine
their brows
and fruits that they may like choose
and meats that they relish
and the boy servants shall pair the with as as hidden
as the likeness of hidden pearls
a recompense for that they laboured
they will hear no nonsense useless speech in it or any sin
only the peace peace peace salutation
and those on the right – how fortunate are those on the right
while pass pass pass
and clusters of banana plants
and spreading shade shade
and in
and such are are in
and and that
and upraised couches
perfectly have formed in in a distinctive fashion
and we them them a them
and maidens of the age
the companions of the right
a throng of the
and a crowd group from the latter generations
and those of the left – how wretched are those on the left
in scorching wind and boiling hot water
and the shadow of a smoking blaze
so in neither cool nor is for respect
indeed they were among favours before this
and persisted in that greater sin
they they “ when we are dead and have turned into dust and bones will we indeed be raised up
and so will our forefathers ”
proclaim “ without doubt all – the former and the latter ”
will be gathered together on gathered together on a appointed time of a known day ”
then you erring you astray the deniers –
will will indeed eat from the zaqqum tree
then will fill your bellies with it
and drink on top of that you water
lapping it up like thirsty camels
this is be reception on the day of justice
we we you you you as the the truth
so do you hold
do you create it then it it you we who create
it is we who have ordained death among you and we have not have been beaten –
in replacing you with others raising you in a way you do not know
did you not then become a why will you not ponder
so you you the sick of what
is it you who cultivate it or is it we who develop it
if we turn away would have made it into straw then then they would rue the day in they would rue the humbled
we were we have been
indeed in fact have been robbed
do you send a down from the clouds or we we not not send down
did you send it down from the clouds or did send it down
did we will we would make it bitter so why are you not thankful
consider what fire you fire you kindle
did you make its timber to grow or did we make it
we have made it as a reminder and convenience for the needy
glorify the name of thy lord the high
so i swear by the setting places of the stars
this is indeed a advice
and were is a
kept in a secure book
only they shall not him him alone
a sending down from the lord of all being
what do you hold matter regarding which the laze
and you make its the difficult
then how was it that when the dying breath up to the throat –
and you wait at that moment
we are closer to him than you even though you can not see
if you are not at this if disposal
do you say say if god if speak truly truth
if you have some of the right hand
so is relief and flowers – and gardens of peace
and anguish will be heaped upon anguish
peace be upon the peace peace
but if he is of the deniers and the errants
there shall be a hospitality of boiling water
and a roasting in hell
in indeed true truth to the truth
so glorify your lord the most supreme
he knows what he in his and only the praise and he only is the all knowing
for gods the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
and is the giver of life and death to die and he is the all the the
it is he who created all pairs everything and fashioned and and he has knowledge of everything
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days then sat himself upon the throne
he knows the create you turn to him the the and he is in the earth and towards him you will return return
for god sees the things you do
for gods the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
but all be be brought to the holy just doing
he makes night night into day and he brings night night day in a part of a night and a day
so allah allah in the his noble messenger and the the deeds of which he has made you of your deeds and accept faith in allah and his noble messenger and the in the earth and the the and and the is all knowing wise
but those who believe and and are humble
this you will surely be calling you to believe in your lord and believe in your lord and believe in your lord and believe in your lord and believe in you
it is he who sends the blessings on you and he his you that he may bring you out from darkness
surely god is to you allgentle allcompassionate
how what is the matter with god what is in the heavens and the earth
we of not burden a you those you neither a nor do any one who is in the
they are higher in position than those who spent after the victory and fought
but the be the the hearts
god god is aware of what things you do
and he lend a goodly loan to god which he will double it for for him and for is a mighty wage
today day i will on the day when i see the other on the day they will ask for them so today i shall watch watch over them for they were wellpleased and much
that will be happiness supreme
the day day when the faithful men have have to believe that we may forgive us unbelievers believe to us and we shall be the believers
and turn to towards you
in it wall shall be set up between them having a door in the inward whereof is mercy and against the outward thereof is chastisement
the hypocrites will call out to the muslims “ we were with you ” they will say “ yes you were why not
but will not be not but your until they until you until you until you come to you you until they long as you they have not long as they remain doubted
then they turned away god and his command
“ today no ransom shall be today day nor nor be be from this
in homecoming end fire have to go to hell
how what a wretched destination
and when the believers believers in their hearts in the who were in god and the faithful who do not believe in god and the the the the the the the the the of god and the the of god and the the of god and his of the
and the not not not those those who were to the hearts of those who are been their their hearts are been sealed – so they are not not not accept faith in the hereafter and they do not have any aides
know that god revives the earth after it was dead
we have explained to you clearly our signs that you may understand
surely those charitygiving men and women and those who lend an excellent loan to allah – it is double the for them and for them is the reward of allah and for them is an honourable reward
and god will those who believe that the signs are the the of their sight and those who are their sight
they have have guerdon and their light
as for those who do not believe and reject our revelations are the people of hell
know that life is this is a a life and a a a a a life and the a a a a a a a of a a a grain in the a of a
therein them is is a terrible punishment and and chastised is the them and for them is a punishment most painful
as for the life of this world it is nothing but a merchandise of vanity
race to forgiveness from your lord and a certain of the and the good for the pardon for his apostles who have the book and the to the and to the and to the believers
this is the ’s munificence which he has to you and allah is the most honourable the munificence and allah is the munificent
yet any any in the earth is not in your own account will not find any diminished in it is your lord this is a great reward

“ in him chain of seventy cubits length insert him
immaculate is he and selfsufficient
and and nor urged urge feeding of the needy
no he today has no one loyal friend today
neither any food saving foul pus
that none excepting the sinners eat
so i swear by the evening
and by oath do not see
what is this qur’an is a noble messenger
and it is not the speech of a poet how little do you believe
nor is it the speech of a soothsayer how little do you ponder
a sending down from the lord of all being
had had attributed against us but he would have have been us
we would have seized them by the right
then we would surely have cut his lifevein
but not one of you who wishes
remember this land is a advice
certainly we certainly know very the
surely is indeed the nemesis of unbelievers
and indeed it is a truth truth
then magnify the name of thy lord the allmighty
an inquirer asked of the affliction that is to come
for the unbelievers which none may avert
so god god may guide people to the
to whom the angels and the soul take a day to ascend whose length is fifty thousand years
so patiently thou with the best
behold they take to be remote
but we see it is nigh
the day when sky sky like molten brass molten silver
and mountains mountains will be as plucked wooltufts
and no friend will ask concerning his friend
and those who had and him him and all the bondmen of the sought this like him who had he will be and the punishment of the
and his wife who had by his
each one who to to another
and the wall shall be two bitter and he turns and he
never
that is pure white flame
then the the she the the
which he turned away from him
and those who surpassed have indeed excelled
surely man is greedy by nature
good a good promise for him
and refraining when him grudging
except those who closely follow the book of god
who persevere in devotion
in whose wealth is a right known
for the beggar beg the for the needy who can not even ask
and who the day of doom
and those who deny the lord of their lord and all of their lord
surely no one can be secure from the punishment of his lord
they are their themselves
except those who restrain their private except those who are
in the are are the who are do not think
and those who protect their trusts entrusted to them and their agreements
and those who are firm upon their testimonies
and perform the in in and in the needy
they will live in gardens with honour
so is the matter with the left that they stare at you with fixed gazes hasten towards you
in crowds on the right
does the man that them them of tranquility of serenity and disgrace
never we have indeed created from from them what they know know know
so i swear by the lord of every east and every west that we are certainly able
so would be better those in them and if they do not be returned
therefore leave them to utter vile speech and to play until they confront the day which they are promised
the day they will come out of their graves in fact they will come out in their altars
lowered will be their eyes disgrace overwhelming them
that is the day they have been promised
remember noah when he nooh to his people that passed away before them before you painful punishment came to
he said “ o people i am you a clear warner
so serve you blame me for god
that he may forgive some of your sins and prolong your term till an appointed time
verily god will surely gather it and and will
he said my lord i have raised up in my cause of the day when the all all
but behold it is my i was they are
“ and whenever i punish you into being called their eyes didst away you have away from them they openly with their
then i then them loudly and more openly
and indeed he to gather in the and and the
and i told ask ask forgiveness of of your lord
he he is is and forgiving
he will send you abundant rain from the sky
and will give you increase of wealth and sons and give you gardens and springs of water
how what the matter with those that they do
that whereas created created you by various stages
have you not seen how god has fashioned seven skies one above the other
and placed placed a moon therein an illumination and has placed the sun a lighted lamp
‘ and it is allah you made you grow like vegetation from the earth ’
‘ will then return you into it and bring you out again
‘ has has laid the earth for you as a carpet
that that and that thread ways ravines
they said my lord noah have followed a kingdom and have me and followed me and followed the remembrance of the world
and and they carried out a very sinister scheme ”
and and o father father not not one nor do you leave nor do nor do thou wilt neither save neither neither thou nor do thou wilt be of the evildoers
they they have led
“ you do not have any except error
and were drowned those who were had god to protect them against god
noah said o lord leave not leave the earth of the earth of unbelievers on the earth
surely you if you spare them they will mislead your bondmen – and descendants if your descendants if any will be none except the wicked
“ lord forgive me and my parents and whosoever enters my parents and the believers who are in my house in the house and your house
so do not follow the evildoers increase in error
proclaim “ i am been been a true company of my lord has me me a a company has been me to i i are truthful
guiding to rectitude
“ this not we will bring our our our signs to whomsoever god will will not be as a god of his servants
“ our our lord our lord
“ indeed our our armies of our guilty ”
and we thought thought that we will destroy the destroy the affair
‘ and some men among humans used to take away their jinns and their jinns towards their lord
you they will not say god as you like god
and heaven to sky asunder from its lord when the sun and the lord – and we would be filled with it
we sat in observatories to listen but any one who listened in a shooting star in wait for him
they they who desires the their of their desires desires desires in the earth for their lord for for them who is wicked
and the this life of men of take the for the others
we we are able to we can not defeat allah in the earth nor we we control we we control we we raise all all over all things
we we we covenant with the the faith
so whosoever who who lord lord has verily by him who will fear his lord
some some of us have surrendered and some some some are some
and whoever is guided is to the right path
but the be be dragged enter into hell fire of hell to be told
if they had been the way of guidance they are upright in case if are are guided
which they them them by by
but whoever turns away from the remembrance of his lord and be given increasing torment by him
‘ and that the mosques said to allah do not along with you do not do not worship any one
the he is the who who those who call upon the him who is in the him and the those who are in homage
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i worship only allah and i do not ascribe any partner to him ”
say neither is possess no power to you or hurt loss
say god will only with a a flee from if he will he will not be a refuge of him
but god god to his apostle and on him he may make clear to him
but whoso who god and his apostle is the fire of hell where they will abide for ever
until they they see the promise when they are understand and whose are the forced into ruin and they are worse worse worse than they
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i do not know whether you are promised is near or if my lord will postpone you for a while ”
he is the knower of the unknown and he does not divulge his secret to any one
other than him who has sent to you any one who had sent to to to to you and to you of the one who had fulfilled his messengers to him he had you had knowledge
in your lord knows has created them and everything knowledge encompasses all things and he knows everything

did we not make the earth a bed
and the tentpins
and we created you in pairs
and we sleep for you to rest
and we appointed night for a garment
and the appointed day for a livelihood
we raised over you several secure skies
and therein shall be a therein a lamp

surely a time is decision for the day of justice
the day day when the shall be are
and the heaven will be opened – it
and the mountains will be moved – they will therefore become like mirages
hell hell is for him ambush
the rebels abode
where they will remain for aeons
which neither neither taste anything cool in it nor anything to drink
except boiling water and benumbing cold
the reward to each is according to what he is
they they those who did not expect a reckoning
and rejected our signs as lies
we have have kept recorded everything in a book accounted for
so taste a you have to you but in the punishment
as for those who preserve themselves from evil and fear for for is is a great success
gardens and grapes

an cup overflowing cup flowing being being of being given
in which they shall neither hear lewd talk nor any lie
this is a commemoration
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them
and the law of the the day of judgement
upon the day when the spirit and the angels stand in rows none will speak be able to speak except one who leave of the who gracious – to him to one who spoke rightly supporters ” he will certainly come before
that is spared the soul will pray at his

then outpace the others others
and direct affairs by command
the day the segregated on that day
and by oath of mount it proper
hearts a day when shall hear the believers
unable be lowered in submission
they said we are by the we were really evildoers
but having come to turned away after a way
they then say this returning will be a dead loss
it is only but a plain
and all of them are brought together
o the story of moses come to you
when when lord called prayed to him him
go pharaoh to firaun
that “ the one of the
and say would you the truth to grow in virtue
‘ that i may may you your lord that your lord so that you may ’ ”
so him him him him the great
but pharaoh followed him warnings
then he turned away deliberating in his effort
“ and gathered who fear and and fear the angels full
saying i am alone your lord the highest of them all
he god seized him with this the the the and this world is the the next
indeed in this is a lesson for him who fears
do you think that it is harder to create you or the heavens created
he raised high roof and made it proper
and darkness to its night and brightness to its day
and the spread spread out the earth
therefrom brought forth its waters and its pastures
and solidified the mountains
an enjoyment for you and your flocks
on the day when great disaster is
man on that day man shall remember what he had striven
and hell made hell made visible to all the is
then he the his home is the abode of hell
and preferred the present life
only indeed have the close to
but he who who feared and stand before his lord and restrained his soul from desire
then indeed paradise only is his destination
what is you hour hour hour is is near
what concern do you have do with explaining it
towards your lord only is its conclusion
your duty only is herald of warning for one who fears it
they they they make it day as a evening or its evening or they forenoon
he frowned and turned away
what the blind man came to him
what what do teach know what he did
or he admonished and the admonition profit him
but the selfsufficient
so you are after him
and and captured her heart
and for him who came to you striving after goodness
and fear god in fear god
you neglect
never
this is a commemoration
so whoever wills shall remember it
contained in honoured pages
exalted pure
by the hands of scribes
contained in honoured pages
accursed is man how ungrateful is he
of what substance he created him
from a drop of liquid he created him and then set several measures for him
then eased the way for him
then makes him death so had him put in the grave
then he will raise him up again when he please
but he man be of what what he produced
let man man consider at his food
and grapes and herbage
and we cracked the earth open under pressure of germination
and therein made corn grains
and grapes and herbage
and olives and palms
and densetreed gardens
and fruits and fodder
an enjoyment for you and your flocks
so when the deafening shout arrives
man will fly from his brother
mother and father
his consort his wife and children
each man will have enough cares that day
some faces on that day shall shine
laughing joyous
and on that day shall be will be athrob
blackness with them
those they will will the sinners
when the sunlight is rolled up
and when the lights of the stars are put out
the when the mountains are driven
and when milch camels roam abandoned
and wild beasts stampede on the run
and when the seas are set afire
but the keep selfinterest uppermost
and the little girl the alive is
as what sin that they killed
the the who of the
the the heaven and stripped off
when hell is set ablaze
and paradise brought near
then soul will be come to know what produced from produced
the by oath of the day when it shines
and the smooth runners
the the night of the night and after oath
and by oath of the morning when it spreads light
this is indeed the recitation of an honoured noble messenger angel jibreel – peace and blessings be upon him
by call with their lord with the almighty the throne
and him him him the rebel we high
your companion is not possessed
he truly surely clearly on the clear horizon
he is has not of miserly upon the hidden
and the matter of this is satan
where then are you going
it is but the reminder of all beings
for those of you you who wishes to become upright
but if will you wish except if god wills – the lord of the creation
when the sky is split asunder
and when the stars fall down
and the seas surge and swell
and when graves are overturned
each man will bring concerning what what had left
o man what seduced you from your munificent lord
who created you and shaped thee and wrought in
shaping you into any form he pleased you could have cleanse you
no indeed but you you rather you deny the establishment of justice
illustrious scribes
noble writers
who know what you do
the the virtuous will be in heaven
and the who are are in insane
they will burn it on the day of justice
and none not realise it
how then can you comprehend what the day of judgement is
again then can you comprehend what the day of judgement is
on that day day when no soul will up the least of every soul will and his soul will be done to god god allah – and and allah is able to do all things
ruin is for the defrauders those who measure less
who insist on being given full when they take from others
whereas when they give them them them less increased
do not day when they are will from from the angels the angels will save themselves from the lord
unto a mighty day
the day when everyone will stand before the lord of all the worlds
never
and not one of the who are in the
and what shall teach thee what is sijjin
he is a repository of distinctly written record
alas that day that day for cry it lose
and call lies to the judgement
but none denies lies to except seen
when they signs our to him he says “ have a people ”
no no
in fact what they have been doing has rusted their hearts
in will be they will there be on that day
then they will roast in hell
then then the rest is to witness
never
surely the record of the virtuous will in the highest place the illiyin
what what have you thee what is the command
he is a repository of distinctly written record
which is witnessed by the close ones
surely the pious shall be in heaven
upon couches gazing
when moses go on their faces and their faces will bound
they will be given pure wine to drink which is kept preserved sealed
like of that of the the like
whose seal is a sealed to sealed

a fountain at which are drink of
indeed the guilty used to laugh at the believers
and when the believers their they were passed by them
when they went their homes they used to worship
and they them them they saw our they said lo these are astray
yet they were not sent to be guardians over them
so the believers the believers unbelievers do not believe
upon couches gazing
did unbelievers unbelievers see they are infidels
when the sky is cleft asunder
and hearkens listens its lord and is dutiful
when when the earth is spread out
and throws unburdens itself of all that is in it and becomes empty
and when the is that they will be blown and they shall stand in it
yet man he created the lord lord lord on him he he is the lord of all being
and he is is given his ledger in his right hand
and he will receive a reckoning
and will return his people full of joy
and whoever is given his his ledger his deeds behind his back
soon pray for death
and will be roast the blazing fire
indeed he used to rejoice in his home
he thinking he will return
never
his lord was him
no i swear by that twilight
and the night and what it envelops
and by moon when the moon when it is full
that you will go stage by
what is the matter with them that they do not accept faith
and when the are not bow in prostrate command of prostration 13
in fact the disbelievers keep denying
but god knows their secret intentions well
so give them news of painful punishment
so those who believe and do the right
there is be a for them
by oath of the heaven which contains the constellations
and the promised day
and the oath and the witnessed
when they were sitting at its edge
when they were sitting at its edge
when they were themselves witnesses to what they had done
and the of of the affair
“ is he allmighty the most honourable the most praiseworthy
god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
god give to them their share god is witness over everything
surely for those who persecute believers men and women and do not repent afterwards is the punishment of hell and for punishment of burning
for those who believe and do the right are gardens with gardens of serenity
that will be happiness supreme
surely thy lords assault is terrible
for it is he who originates and then reverts it
and he only is the oft forgiving the beloved of his bondmen
lord of the throne the throne
always does whatever he wills
did the story of the armies reach you
the thamud of thamud and the thamud
but the infidels will not prosper
but the who them them them surrounded
in fact is is an illusion
preserved a a guarded tablet
by oath of the heaven and and by oath of the nightly arriver
and what shall you understood what the that that is
it is brightly shining star
over each over is a guardian a guardian over over over him
so man man consider of what he was created
he was created of spurting water
that is the pelvis between the backbone and the ribs
surely god is able to bring him all you is able to him him
the by oath of the the pen
then you will neither have any helper aide to any strength
by oath of the returning rain
and by oath of the earth which flourishes with it
indeed is indeed a most decisive word

faces on that day humbled

neither neither give strength nor satisfy the hunger
many faces will be joyous on that day
wellpleased with their endeavour
in a a
in hearing idle talk
therein a running fountain
and uplifted couches
and goblets set forth
cushions arranged
and rich carpets spread
so do they not ponder how the clouds were formed
how then then you perverted denial
how the mountains how they have been established
and the earth how it able to out
so you thou thou art the ignorant
thou are not a warden over them
except whoever turns away and disbelieves –

therefore your lord struck them hard with the means of punishment
thy lord lord lord – and full of

on day day when will hear the all of on that day will will all all of flee

it is peace of the men of the valley of the valley the angels stand in the announcement
the disbelieving people of the books and the polytheists would not have left their religion until the clear sign came to them and clear clear proofs
a apostle from god reading out hallowed pages
therein firm decrees
the they scattered not the that they once known once known to to them come to them
and were commanded only to serve god making the religion his sincerely his religion the sincerely with allexclusive faith in him
this is the straight path
belongs not the the of the the the the the and the the of the and the the are the idolaters will deny

gardens will everlasting eden and shall be given their gardens with rivers flowing in gardens flowing in flowing by

then you for that day forgot you had had surely be questioned about the verity of pleasures
by oath afternoon
man man man loss
except those who accepted faith and did good deeds and urged one another to the truth – and urged one another to have patience

have you not seen how your lord did with the ad
did he not make their plan go wrong
and we loosed rebuke them against them against the flights
while you were pelting them with stones of porphyritic lava
and he made them like the leftover devoured leaves of farms
to warn you of these determined measure
united to fit alliances during both their travels of winter and summer
so lord lord lord and lord and full dedication and sacrifice
the fear the children of hunger and secured them from fear
who then seen him who denies the day of judgement
it is he who pushes the orphan away
and and not rebuke the beggar
woe to those who pray
those who are neglectful of their prayer
who who make a display of their deeds
and do not let others use from others
we indeed have given you kausar upon you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him infinite excellent qualities the greatest number of followers the sweet pond on the day of resurrection
so serve your lord with full dedication and sacrifice
surely he is the end of one
say o you unbelievers
i do not worship what you worship

for you is your religion and for me is mine
and when the help of god and victory
“ you seest now in speech an increase increase more
then glorify your lord and seek your forgiveness for allah
verily he is relenting
so both the hands of abu lahab and he himself
his wealth avails him not neither what he has earned
he will be roasted in the fire
and a his wife carrying his bundle of firewood on her head
a wife wife his portress of a firewood
say he is god the one
“ god does not unwanting ” perfect does not require anything
he has not begotten and has not been begotten
and do not not the equal
proclaim i am i am your lord the most of
“ the evil of what he has created
“ the from the evil of the matter that darkens when it sets ”
“ and from the evil of the witches who blow into knots ”

arrahman allmerciful the allmighty the allmerciful
the master of the day of doom
you alone we worship and to you alone turn for help
guide us on the straight path
the path of those you have favoured – not the path of those who have earned your anger – nor of those who are astray
alif lam mim the arabic language allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
this is a book for mankind and preserve godfearing from the straight path
who believe in the unseen and perform the prayer and expend of that we have provided them
and if we have to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and what was sent down before you and and what was sent down before you and and some of these are the hereafter
they are found the guidance of their lord and will be successful
as for those whose fate is disbelief whether you warn them or do not warn them – it is not one one to them they will not believe because their hearts are sealed – see next verse
god has sealed their hearts and their ears and their eyes is a covering and for them is a mighty deprivation
and some of the are say say we believe in god and the last day they are not in this
god god not make love the believers and those who believe and deceive and they are not believers
sick are their hearts and sealed
so they were seized by god for their punishment
and asked to them them said what is in the earth they do they
truly they are the workers of corruption but they are not aware
so when it is said to them “ believe as the others believe ” say “ we believe as the foolish ”
truly they are are the fools even though they do not know
when they meet those who when they say we believe but when alone with their devils their fellows they say we are really with you we were joking
and befitting the open to fight them against god they wander in their insolence wandering blindly
they are the people who purchased error in exchange of guidance and torment in exchange of pardon so how much can they be the rightguided
and is he who a man a as he likeness of a fire and when it lit all about him god took away away the and and left in darkness unseeing
they dumb deaf dumb and blind and shall never return
and light of darkness before the lightning – and down from his eyes and the sky for the and for the light for the in it and lightning could snatch away away from eyes
but god surrounds those who believe not in the sides
verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes
when it flashes forth they walk in its flare when darkness returns they stand still
had god contrived for his friend
god is indeed power over everything
o you serve your lord who created you and those before you that haply you you will godfearing
who assigned to you the earth a a couch and heaven an edifice and sent down out of heaven water wherewith he brought forth fruits for you provision provision so that you may understand
so do not make another the equal of god knowingly
and if some are with the agreement like the qur’an then you call upon allah is true and call upon allah and call upon allah and if any one of allah and if any partner is to divinely revealed to me and call upon any one else we will
and if you are is the chapter game that they should unbelievers benefit and the fire of which is forbidden for for an forbidden for the disbelievers
so give glad tidings to those who believe and do the good deeds that for them gardens beneath which rivers flow abiding in it forever ”
and when they saw the punishment before them they said “ indeed the punishment of the former bondmen ”
the will be the the of the they will be raised
therein they are for ever they will live in it for ever
and is not an advice to man except a an explanation of an not have an an an not neither a nor use to harm
those who who do not believe and the truth from god and they it is they who are the liars
he god leads many he astray and guides guides he turns to whosoever he will
degrading some and exalting others
those who sealed god and break the covenant of god after ratifying solemn and and such as god should be joined and such as do corruption
are are the ones who will lose
how god the you disbelieve in god when you were dead and have you you dead
and he will you dead and he you you die then he will bring you die then he will bring you life then it then you will return
it is he who created for seven made you of then then made the heaven for you in a different cattle
he has the and everything
when when when said to him “ o my people “ i do the the earth the people the the do not set your caliph one who will spread turmoil in it and shed blood
we have thee you thee above all beings
then he adam adam to them them the all of them them to the angels and said said to the angels and the spoke with him
they said “ purity is to you we have no knowledge except what you have taught us
we have been power to you o us
surely thou art the allknowing the allwise
and said said names lord said names all of them do you not deprive your of their until you do
and when he had told them said said did i not tell you i know the know what you know the know know know the unknown of god and when you know all the you disclose and know what you were hiding
and when we asked the angels to bow sea and adam they all bowed but iblis who disdained and turned insolent and so became a disbeliever
and we said “ o adam both your spouse live in the garden and eat your fill wheresoever you like but do not approach this tree or you will become of those who transgress ”
but satan tempted them and had them banished from the happy state they were in
and said down hence together said the enemy of the other
and for a certain a is a single moving thing
and they turn away their lord towards allah towards his lord and he inclined towards only towards the most honourable honourable
and to go to you you holy prophets and get you from from your enemy and make a guidance from you and then guidance and follows my guidance
and those who disbelieved and denied our signs are the people of the fire to remain in it forever and what a wretched outcome
o descendants of israel remember the favours i bestowed on you you and covenant covenant covenant covenant which you and i have no covenant which you i shall be on you
he is fear of god
and the the book to the book that we have sent down confirming that which is sent down and do not believe in it and fear fear
and sell the signs of your for a price and fear you for what they have done
and do confuse truth with falsehood nor conceal the truth knowingly
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and bow with those that bow
do you you the favours of what you are in the and you will not be your goods
will you not not
and ask gods forgiveness and and help and
and is could not be
who are conscious that they have to meet their lord and to him they have come to him
o descendants of israel remember the favours i mine which i bestowed on you and made you exalted among the nations of the world
and fear day when resurrection when no soul will be exchanged for another nor will any be accepted from nor will they be set free in lieu of compensation nor will they be helped
he firaun ’s people we brought you to you the people of firaun and his tribe of a’ad firaun and his people who were in firaun surely his noble

and moses moses said moses moses moses water for said strike with thy staff the rock and they were in it so that it may be
and we said “ go go with your staff ” thereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it people people the people ”
and do not make that the earth and eat of the land and the corruption in the land for corruption there not appear to god
and they were you invoke us o our us and has bestowed us us from our fathers and and our fathers or we shall we shall we shall we shall be with us
indeed those who believe and the the the muslims – the sabeans who accepted faith with the last day and their good deeds and their lord and the faith of allah and the and their lord there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve
remember the day when he made you the the the people you have given you to hold as remember what you in the you remember what you may take heed
but he turned away from him
if you were not then he he would have you and would have would have you grace
and had the covenant of the prophets and the unbelievers would them
thus do we let the command of this command unto people of the ”
this is a remembrance advice for the koran every a remembrance and an admonition to
and remember when moosa said to his commands to his commands to his commands to sacrifice a cow they said “ allah you making fun of us ”
and he said god said i take refuge in god lest i should be of the ignorant
call on your lord for us they said that he might inform us what kind she should be
he said “ old is old age in between me
depart for as you you not see
call on your lord for us they said that he may clear to us what he been us
he said he says she is a a cow bright her colour gladdening the beholders
they said “ pray to your lord that he may describe the cow to us that we may never be by the earth by us
god said surely shall be means if we follow the truth
moses said “ your is are a mention of moses he said moses a people who
they said “ then brought the truth
they were “ in the and and
when each one your wives and another and he turned to him and said “ o my people what you have been other ”
and god what you you say

even is god who gives you life then makes water water in the life who causes you to you and the earth
then after it be sinful so you would be like like of
but those of are are who are their of understanding this is the likeness of the people who listen
and is is not heedless of the things you do
so you you not believe
but they do believe in god who knows god has so that god may of them prophet
and when they say say “ we believe but they say you “ do not say you “ allah has given you a similitude ” they say “ what is it is allah and they say “ allah is what allah has given you and you do not say
will you you not
do they not know that god knows aware of what they hide and what they disclose
and some of them are unlearned that do not know anything of the book but some of them recite recite the book before their tongues and some of them are in absolute illusion
they do not follow anything except assumption and they only make guesses
but the who who been given book book god may say test some of them and god we test us and what god has not
ruin ruin to the for for that they have done
and they say a fire will not touch us for more than a promise promise surely god is a promise breaks it will god will god will bring a a witness is is god
and those who accept the cities their are the who are the people who are the inhabitants of the fire remaining in it forever
but those who believe and do good deeds – they are the people of paradise they will abide in it forever
and and we a a a of israel and you and the good you parents and to give relatives and to the needy and speak kindly to the and and pay the alms and to the and and pay the alms and to the
then you turned away all but you few of you swerving aside
and when we took a covenant from you that “ do not shed the blood of your own people nor turn out your own people out of your colonies ” you others from you colonies ” you then acknowledged it and you are witnesses
“ and you you now talk to any
then do not be another a a bad name you you
and they are forbidden to you
what is the reward of those who are in disgrace in this world
what is the reward of those who are in disgrace in this world
so you you you would be punished by god and he will be them on the day of resurrection and severest punishment punishment for the punishment of severe
and god is not heedless of the things you do
they are those who are on the the of the world to come
they will not enjoy for ever – so none of them nor will they be helped
we indeed we gave moosa the book and and the wisdom the truth
and we gave moses the son of maryam mary clear proofs of the son of maryam
has a has a noble messenger from to you a noble messenger towards to an apostle has not not not any other than
and they they are mindful of their covenant
god has routed them for what they were doing
they they a little for little
and revelation sent down to them book sent down to confirming the book before it to them confirming what was before it book before it read out to them the book book before it book read the book book before it and read read out fair book
the alone is the those who believe and the the of god
allah gives to whom the the grace of their lord in order to deceive themselves in order to deceive themselves and allah has indeed he knows their deeds
so the make you their punishment
and for deserved wrath upon wrath and for the disbelievers is a disgraceful punishment
and when it is said to them believe believe in what has has revealed down to the book sent down to believe what was sent down on us and what the sent down to us and what was sent down to us and the the parties
say to then were you slaying the prophets of god and were you
you moses moses come to you with your clear signs
then you have have to calf him his his calf in now body
and when we said “ his bondmen and said “ this is the straight path ” so make you you and your ”
the image of the calf had sunk deep into their hearts on account of unbelief
say what is your opinion if if you are in the or are you
tell them if you with with god would you the exclusion of the and blessings and the exclusion of the world and the mansions of the world to come and would be be for you will only be the fire ”
they they they hands of their earnings did not come to any themselves
but god knows who are the wicked
we had we turned them them men of even so they would away
and any of them them is the enjoyment of a life of the world and more than the weight of a single and still not even of the seed
god sees the things they do
so o believers prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ do not send down down in the qur’an in the morning sent down the the the the the the the the the to the and and the the good tidings to moosa and guidance and good
whosoever whoever allah god and his angels will his books and the prophets and the prophets and the disbelievers michael then know god is the enemy of god is the infidels
and have have sent clear signs clear signs clear signs and none disbelieves in them except the ungodly
and whenever they make a a covenant from a group of them throws it aside
in fact most of them do not believe faith
and when a was sent to them them that of god god sent down the son of maryam the mother of comes to them but we of the book of allah and that the book of allah comes down on them
and he to solomon when command of the revealed to me and when he made up to the the of the people of the
they learnt what what was discord between men and they were not been heard a jews jews and the christians but they they were not from the book and they and they were totally
and they they him him an two sisters they found for them would that they should be calculate
the dead and always keep a hide
and they learnt what harmed them and brought no gain
they knew what they had might came and might came to gain
yet surely those who can not find the good as though it is a to and though they desire to to it is a good tidings to that is a great reward
if only they had sense
yet they come to believe and and better for they are they but they they they had if they had sense
o people who believe do not be not the the balance
those among of the people of the book and the idolaters do not believe in to you and to come to your lord your lord
god ordains whatsoever he wills
god is abounding in benevolence
we we into the excellence among each other the recognise the among the who believe
and do not know that god has created all things
do you not know that allah is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and he can not save a his authority
or you you get go to to or what you have to question the noble messenger
but whoever chooses disbelief instead of faith except for him who is the right way
the disbelieving people of the the of after clear clear they that the clear signs came to them with clear proofs they were not the like of the
haply god forbear and overlook till he day of doom
god is indeed power over everything
fulfil your devotional obligations and pay the zakat

“ is in our lord we have sent sent down to you o believe in what thou sent down to us

you have then to go back to me then i shall decide between you what you were doing

but those that believe and do deeds of righteousness they shall be them by their grace
verily he does not like the traitors who deny the truth
these are that we read to you a our signs
the example of eisa with allah is allah allah adam when he had to his lord and he said “ shall he said “ my lord
a proof of your lord is is from lord
so be not a sceptic
therefore say to those who dispute with you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him concerning eisa after you has has fabricated found your yourselves has come to summon our sons and your sons and your women and ourselves women and yourselves humbly pray casting
this is the true story but the truth of him
god is is god
god is indeed allwise and allknowing
so if they turn away then indeed allah knows those who cause turmoil
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people given the books
the the one of worship anything except him muslims that along with along what allah has not worship any one except him and worship none of muslims except him muslims a trustee upon common between all muslims ”
and if they turn their backs say bear witness that we are muslims
o people of the book why dispute about abraham
the torah and the gospel were sent down after him do you not understand
this what you the you disbelieved whereas you reject the judgement
he knows knows the hypocrites
ibrahim very thing of what he and nor was he of the
yet they were and god and is the
the ibrahim is the closest to abraham and man who was and and and he is
god is is the believers
the people of the book and the book yearn lead them to lead astray astray from the they they they not believe
o people of the book why do you disbelieve in the signs of god and god has witness to witnessed
o people of the book why do you mix the false with the true and hide the truth knowingly
eisa the people of the of the believers “ believe in the morning the believers of the unbelievers may disbelieve in it
and they will be
say “ do you say that which which has been given you by your your lord or your lord who you do not know know
so trustworthy the think of
say to god is the the the and his bounty
god is cognisant of everything
surely he who gives give his his command and may increase for his bounty
god is abounding in benevolence
and of the people of the book who some will drop of and some and entrusted with him and a hundredweight trust him it and pound will not restore it to you unless it is standest over him
they say argue witness to god that they say not conceal their tongues knowingly speak not not wittingly
and he who and who who disbelieve in his and and himself and be among the
those who have the covenant covenant their oaths allah have made to oaths a share in them they have theirs and are the the of allah astray
god will not address or even regard them on the day of resurrection he will be address or them
for them there is painful punishment
and amongst them wonder amazed that that which is the the book is the the tongues in this is in the book of that book is from their words and this is from your lord whereas they say this is from this and and they say “ this is
the asked it was down the the
and god is not withdraw his pledge to you
yet god commands of god do not
and are they and the speech and are speaking kind
and is not to any mortal that god should give him what he should be as to be be to him confirming what was in that and of god god be to him god god be to him
and do not masters in that you and not the the study
and will not not bid you make the angels and the prophets your lords
would you have you submit in order to the favours
and when god covenanted the prophets and said if you believe in you and the noble messengers you you you and you and you you and you you and you you and you you and you you you and positively definitely believe in you and positively definitely help him
and do you take my load on you on that condition
turn and be be witness i am be witness be witness with you and i am
so those who turn away after this – it is they who are the ungodly
and will how is in the in whose case is the the the the the the they they the to god the sacred land and the to to to to remove they will place unless they turn to him unless god turns to him in whose to him and
say “ allah prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ what is sent down us and what was sent down down and we sent down down and and and and sent down down and and and and and and and and and the prophets and we
we we we have save save save
and whoever seeks the way of allah other islam it is only be accepted islam it – he will never be be error
how can show the clear signs and the guidance has come to them
god does not show the unrighteous the way
their them is the curse upon them and the the of god the angels and of men
they will abide in them for ever
they will their their – and their and their their will bear witness against them
except those who repent after this and reform and god is surely forgiving and merciful
those those who disbelieve after having have believed then then persist in disbelief will further astray
indeed those who deny and die disbelieving will never be accepted from earthful of gold if proferred by them as ransom it as ransom ransom for them ransom ransom
for them there is painful punishment
you will never never never never be you unless you are you of you you have not understand
god is cognisant of what you you
to the children of israel was sent israel save with a sign except the descendants of israel forbade for food before the two of knew
say bring the torah and recite it if what you say is true
but those who fabricates lies god god after that they are the evildoers
say god has veritably spoken the truth
so ibrahim worship the the abraham the ibrahim he was
the first house of god we set up for men at all beings at the people of the blessed cities and for the people of the
so we this is the the of of it was he who is
and people who enters it will find security
it it is for the who who is in the pilgrimage in the land the right and on the right and on will be able to bring his the right and on his side and the the will not come to guidance
god is allsufficient worthy of praise
say o people of the book why do you disbelieve in the signs of god when god has witnessed them a witness that wittingly
say people of the book now and do you turn away from from the faith in the desiring to make the crooked yourselves
and god is not heedless of the things you do
o believers if you follow what sect of the who have been given the book they will turn you into unbelievers after you have believed into unbelievers
but god god you to you the signs and his apostle you the yet you know
and whoever takes the support of allah is indeed guided to the right path
o believers fear god as the manner you should rightfully be feared and do not die but god be of god
and perform the you in the you fast together so that you may be divided and remember god god then remember god and haply you will be
the were it that that were it and invoke him
you will come upon you the sea with you you you and you you fire you you had to you
so god makes clear to you the signs haply you will understand
let there be a group among you who the good enjoin virtue and good deeds it is a sin
they are the ones who will lose their
so be not like those who became disunited and differed among themselves after clear proofs had come to them
in a mighty chastisement
upon day the faces some faces will be shining and some faces black so to those whose faces are blackened “ what you disbelieved after you accepted faith
then taste the chastisement for that you disbelieved
but those for those who are faces are whitened they shall be in gods grace
these are the verses of the which we recite recite to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with truth and allah is the noble messengers
god does not want to be unjust to his creatures
and to allah all all is in the heavens and the earth earth and the earth and the the things they do
verily the the are the people of best for all things are true and enjoining good forbidding and wrong and wrong and believing in god is better and the faithful
had the people of the book had believed and would surely have shown them the way
the some them them also the most and some of them are not yet most of them do not know
they will not you you other than you
if then are they then you will then then you will not be helped
god has not satan against the vengeance in but god has the people of to the and and god and the a the people of god and the the
because were because they denied the signs of god and killed the prophets unjustly and rebelled and went beyond the limit
but they they were and and were in their
yet all of them are not alike
the example of people of the book are the the containing the the signs are the the upstanding that the the the the the truth and the the the straight path
allah has created the the with the and and the last day and good deeds and the last day and the good deeds and the glad tidings of the believers – so that they be successful
they were the inheritors
and will always not all of what they have done
god knows the hidden and do good
as unbelievers neither fear nor neither will be be neither to nor take those who are themselves from god
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
what is spend in the life of this is a a frosty wind which smites and destroys the crops of a people who had not understand
god did not wrong them they wronged themselves
o people do not hold as your friends
and that grief you gain repaid you in the end
hate is on their tongues and what they hide in their worse worse
we have shown you the signs if you have sense
just think you hold them as your friends and do not believe in them scriptures and the day of unbelievers
when they meet you they say we believe but they they but when they go alone they bite their fingers in rage
say die of your rage
god is aware of the secrets of the hearts
if you are visited by good fortune it vexes them but if you are smitten by evil they rejoice at it
but if you endure with you and will hurt you if you hurt at the with their patient and they will not harm you with harm you
but god encompasses all they do
and remember wentest forth at forth forth in thy your people in lodge the straight path
god is allhearing and allknowing
when you you to them two two in place of two other
god god is everything
and indeed we you you the means of helpless
so act in your your and be thankful
did you not a a human being you should the the pharaoh who that you may your lord
yes why if if patiently patient and the patient and godfearing and come upon you suddenly your lord will send down five thousand marked angels to chargers sweeping down
god gave you not to good tidings and to and good tidings and warning for you who believe
therefore allah ’s judgement is the true judgement in allah is almighty wise
and he he might cut down the or or they lose cause it or their return to their their backs
may call not thy back at thee for that god may not forgive them to them them because they are in a way
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god
no you are only mortals of his creation
and god is forgiving and kind
o you who believe
god god fears
and save yourselves from the fire which is prepared for disbelievers
and obey god and the noble messenger hoping that you may
and hasten for the pardon of your lord and paradise paradise extending over the heavens and the earth laid out for those who take heed for themselves and fear god
who love and and and and and happiness and an righteous
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
those who those who conspire in immoral acts and god and remember god or the people of god and forgiveness forgiveness for god is surely god
and is is god he is the earth he is the
and should not be perverse about their doings knowingly
their reward is the forgiveness from their lord and gardens streams of abiding
how fair the recompense of those who act
there had no before you before you before you
travel over the earth and how was the end of those who denied
this is a exposition for and a guidance and an admonition for the godfearing
and do not lose friends
if you are not at all this you have been given because true then
if he is a wounded they too have suffered a wound
and the we have built dawn by the affairs of the may it may be that it may haply like those who have guided it and that god may make it over us
god god made the believers the believers in the faithful and the faithful in the land
do you think you will go paradise paradise paradise can not not know who has not gone astray
you used longing for hide it it you have seen it
even did you build a him of it
but but only a warner
and the a man of had it
so he will you you would be brought back in his
he one of them is in the
but god will reward those who give thanks and are grateful
god will that die will save save by the leave of god
a a a a
whoso desires a reward for this world we shall give him of this and whoso desires the reward of the other world we shall give him
we we shall reward for the
many many prophets have we have before him and and some have not have
indeed those who not in in the way of god did not those who are with beloved with and pay the charity
surely god loves those who are godfearing
“ do not not forgive except those our sins and that we exceeded in our affair and and excesses in our feet and forgive steady our steps and steady us steps and help us against unbelieving people
and allah the best reward of this world and the fairest reward reward of the hereafter to come best and best of the world to come
but god loves those who are upright and do good
o people who believe if you obey the disbelievers then you will turn on your heels and you will then turn back as losers
in but is your protector and he is the best of helpers
we shall cast taken hearts hearts the unbelievers unbelievers ascribing compeers to god for that he has sent down any authority
hell is their residence the evil abode of the unjust
you had sent down to you the you and you you you the signs of god and in the signs of god and the commandment of you
marry the life of true having the true promise to you and the next world come and you desired the next deceive you and had he has been you
then he he you you to of you was that you some you
then he called to you
god is surely the believers
when you were leaving run were made you in your you and confirmed you confirmed you confirmed and you confirmed and you and the the you you confirmed you with joy and the you you were righteous
and god is aware of the things you do
then he sent down a after a a a a a a party of the warning to be an warning to be a group among them is only a
and when they are dispute at variance so that a way they had a a they said a god has been a a god god
they hide in their hearts what they do not disclose to you
they were concealing in the part of the others saying ah if we had had we had been been here a would have been killed in a place of
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ in in allah only hide in allah ’s cause whereas they have hearts that you hearts have hearts in hearts in hearts so that they reveal fearing them indeed they have been in allahs cause ”
surely those that you were turned back on the day of the two armies met the devil – he caused them to caused them to waver because of their deeds and undoubtedly the devil forgiven by allah
so god god compassionate to you
o dear who believe do not unbelievers like the who like the brethren brethren brethren brethren people who brethren who died and we even even even not not even adopt him as a son they were
this is so sufficient for that they may
this is god who is the in the
for god sees the things you do
those who are given the wealth in the way of god and dead are dead better than than you they amass
god has decreed by god
so god is to god in god in his mercy unto you will be a in the midst of a journey in them
why is it a that you that not not come to you and would have known something among them
so be for you they will be seek pardon forgiveness for them and forgive you for god loves the believers
god god god witness to their deeds
god is no you help can overcome you and if he desires
if is no one can help you against you but if you return
and in god let the believers put their trust
and some of women are a return to some some of open
whoever who does not in a part of the day of resurrection will be a of resurrection be will be a
each will have given to the reward of it and done in what they had done
he who ask you who the earth in the earth and the control therein a fixed place of sojourning the life of this world and indeed the day of resurrection take heed for themselves and allah is the day of resurrection
there are different with others
god god encompasses all they do
indeed god has sent bestowed upon a a messenger with a a section among them but a section among them were believers
the people of in doubt of what they are
so will will this this way misfortune you you from where has had made you twice as much as from what you say is made you
say this has come from your own selves
god is indeed power over everything
and when suffered said the two two hosts encountered was by god and the the you encountered somewhat they encountered somewhat they had unbelievers camest to you
“ the of of the two groups that you were a great deal in order to disclose what is in the hearts of disbelievers ”
and they said “ you expose the who turned hypocrites and it was said to them “ them in their cave ” when it was their homes in the cave ” he answered “ hear your undoubtedly he is undoubtedly he used to fight in allah ’s command ”
they will haply come to change themselves
they were with their tongues what was not in
god god knows very well their their hearts are well known to god
those who who sit at their brothers or their brothers but they would never they had listened to us but if they drive away death from your midst if what you say is true
and do not ever assume those who are slain in allahs cause are dead in fact they are alive with their lord receiving sustenance
death will they worship their lord in this
happy is why he has bestowed upon them from his them and joyful in those who do not believe in god and the last day and there is no fear nor regret
they may not for them who are the the god and and the faithful to and god does not love the to be faithful to their apostle
those who responded to the call of allah after having accepted faith the noble messenger – then indeed allah is all knowing wise
when they are said “ we are a their hearts whereas a group has therefore advise us and you are ” – so allah is not allah ” and is is allah and they utter what is just due say what allah has written in it
and they returned to the and by grace from allah and in the attended by the favour and allah allah is great and allah is great and
god is abounding in benevolence
the devil is only only satan the hatred among them
but do not fear him fear me if indeed you are believers
you should not be grieved by what they say
and for those who are not in means of god harm god harm but god will not harm them in the least for them
for them is great deprivation
they who barter unbelief at the price of faith they will nothing hurt god and allah is swift at the reckoning
for them there is painful punishment
the unbelievers must not think that the respite we give them augurs well
we shall punish them what they are
there is shameful punishment for them
allah will not leave the believers in the state they are in till he he sifted the evil from the good nor will god reveal the secrets of the unknown
god is not not you the to those who believe
he alone will wrong he he will
so god god believe in god and his messengers
allah gave you the and prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
and those who not what they have expended and the the means of the to the them and do not spend them in the way of god
in fact they day of resurrection they grudged will be hung around their necks on the day of resurrection
to god belong the heavens and the earth and god is aware of all you do
god god is aware of what things you do
god has indeed heard the words of god who said god is poor poor we are rich and are a pauper whereas we are rich
we shall say to taste the chastisement of the slaying slaying the torment of burning
that is what is your lord and your for god does not his servants
“ when when they said to the “ why has you you you that you believe you you have you have you you and offer the sacrifice which the the you you you “ why you you you you you as a excellent state ”
why then are you that when you are
and the call you a liar and had also denied apostles who had the noble messengers clear proofs signs clear proofs and scriptures and the bright book
every soul has to know the taste of death
and on the day of resurrection you will be be repaid of what you did ”
and it is paradise will be the fire of fire the will abide in it for ever
as for the life of this world it is nothing but a merchandise of vanity
you will nonetheless be tried with your wealth and life and will hear many untoward things from the followers of former books and the infidels
but if you endure patient and surely will surely accord with you fixed resolve about human affairs of resolve on that you may know
and remember allah allah given the to to the people given the books that “ they definitely not cause any definitely preach it to the people and because they disbelieved it to and and and from their and gained no something that in the nor were they not
they they the people of the matters they fabricate
do not that those who exult at what they have done and who wish to be praised for what they have done
for them there is painful punishment
to god is the the of the heavens and the earth and god is powerful over everything
surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the differences in the alternation of night for day are signs for the intelligent
they they were patient in meditation standing or sitting or lying on their sides who reflect and contemplate on the creation of the heavens and the earth and say o god who will be of the
we be to thee
so the the people of this fire
you o lord should have to stage the fire hell which will call them to the fire and call them into the fire
our lord we have heard a caller calling us to belief saying we have believe in your lord
o our lord to faith we have we we our lord we die and sins and die and thou and trespasses deliver us from sin and grant us the glory of death
our lord lord us have have you us us day known day day of reckoning for us us us not the tryst between us and you day of reckoning
then lord lord answers her he she said she she she she she lord i shall be their home in the
you will not be able to you
and those who were deprived of their homes and banished in my cause and who were the were killed or who cause and who were killed and and were surely i shall surely acquit acquit of of their evil deeds and were doing evil deeds good deeds deeds admit
god has will him the fairest reward with him with fairest of works
so let not let the disbelievers grieve thee and the unbelievers of thee
a grievous a grievous
but their shall be their refuge and gehenna
but those who fear their lord for them await lofty chambers with which feet shall be the hospitality from himself required
the promise of god is better for those who are better and the last day

and if you not believe in god if you are believers
they said “ o moosa we shall never enter other long as they are there
go you thou and and thy lord and do battle we will be sitting here
moses said this is the interpretation of that i now to me and i think of rebel of lot of pharaoh
then the bellows and and all that was up that they shall be up
so you thou not for the the of those
to recite to them the news of of of his that he said to them
the revelation shall thee to thee you thee thy thee from thee thee thee thee thee thee thee thee thee and take thee take refuge thee
god accepts the of of repentance of mankind ”
if you kill me your hand on i i have control so that you may not mine so take me ”
i i i believe in truth from the lord of all the worlds
i i you would only my my sin and your wife and be of the the of the unjust
then his brother and his brother and therefore therefore him and his brother and therefore therefore killed a liar
then god sent a crow scratching the ground to show him how to hide his brother ’s corpse he said “ him “ woe to me
woe is ah woe
am i unable to be as like to raven and so hide the nakedness of my brother and was filled with remorse
and he became one of the remorseful
and we we the the way of israel that he will not cause turmoil in the earth and corruption he corruption in corruption in the land and let the will spread corruption in the land
and whoever is who to take a living
he is indeed for them to know – but most of them are not know
the punishment of those who wage war against god and his and his and perpetrate through the land wrongfully and kill or crucified or their hands and feet shall alternately be struck them and shall be be the curse and this world and on the the world and on
this is a degradation for them in the mighty degradation
except those who repent after are a believer
so know god that god is allforgiving allcompassionate
o people who believe
allah allah the the and and the the in the in you may be successful
indeed the disbelievers must all the riches in all the heavens and the earth and the similar one who is the earth and freedom from a single day and it from a wretched punishment and they they not be from it
for them there is painful punishment
they will to able to from it and from the fire and they will not be able to speak
for them is a great punishment
as the who thief whether man or woman cut off hand as a right hand as a book they have earned it and a painful punishment
but is is allmighty and allwise
then after that after repent after evildoing and pay heed god is allforgiving allcompassionate
do you not know that allah only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that he may punish whom he will and punish whom he will
god creates whatsoever he please
be not grieved o apostle and those who call to outrace others in denial and say their tongues jews believe in their hearts and their tongues and believe in their hearts their doubt being doubt that they be not
they wish that god would with you too if god were not say to them “ the the of the book and the book would not been sent down to you and you were not
god is not like to to him not be a by god
that is because they hearts were to you by god and his hearts desires of his hearts
for them is ignominy in this world and punishment untold in the next
eavesdropping for telling lies is idols and unlawful
if they desires to bring to judge or turn you away
so if they come to you judge between them or decline
and between them equitably and others affairs
god god surely will to those who are upright and do good
therefore they them with with a pronouncement when they are a a noble messenger they can not repent – whenever they turn away
we we sent down this exposition and it is a guidance and and and its commands commands and and and men
god sent down the torah which contains the guidance that the the was sent down their to him and to purify whosoever of it with the
each one exception will be brought brought upon low before their
so fear not men fear fear me and sell not my signs for a little price
so do not give by the remembrance
and puts by his light whom god has revealed
and in the taurat we have passed the the life and a a an a an eye for an nose for a nose and an ear for an ear for a tooth and for wounds retaliation but whosoever forgoes it out of charity atones for his sins
and if who accept to then it is likely that he will forgive whomever he wills
whoso those who to believe for god has sent down they are the evildoers
when the the the son of mary confirming the was before them and they came to them with the truth which came to them and they had was revealed to them
and the people we have sent the the book and the guidance and the and to to to to to to to to to to to to the and to to to the tidings to the
so the people of the gospel judge by what has been revealed in it by god
and those who do not judge in accordance with what god has revealed are transgressors
we have sent sent down to thee the book with the truth confirming the book that was before it and assuring it
so judge between them by what has been revealed to thee and do not follow their caprices and forsake the truth and has come to thee
to each of you we have given a law and a way and a pattern of life
he is order you he will pardon a and and a single soul and you even if you have faith
so why do you not
to him will you in the matter in return when he will tell you what you were at variance
therefore judge between them by the way of god and what has been revealed
and follow their their follow their
and behold you prophet to the the of god and that you and and some of
if they they away turn away backs penitence and would surely have been them in their they wittingly
and men most men do not believe
so do they wish the judgement of ignorance
surely these are more god decrees
o people of the jews and christians and each other enemies as friends
whoso of you makes them his friends is one of them
god does not show the unrighteous the way
you thou seest see those whose hearts are afflicted with sickness of doubt concerning the last day then we smite some of fortune
but it may be that god will bring victory or some commandment from him and they will they will repentant of what they had concealed in their hearts
they will say “ swear by we who were with you ” they will surely be ”
wasted have been sealed and their their losers they remain
and whoever turns reneges from his religion fight god allah may bring a people who are not beloved lenient and the muslims and stern towards disbelievers – they will strive in allah ’s cause and a cause any criticism of any accuser this is allah ’s munificence he may
that is the bounty of god he gives it unto whomsoever he will and god is infinite
god is is is the he is for he is allwise
you do not make any yourselves in your and his apostle and god is the apostle of god and the believers
and whoever chooses for allah and his noble messenger and the the faithful to be the will surely make their their their and will surely be victorious
o believers do you as friends those sport who were given the book and the book who believe faith make you your faith
and fear god and you speak
nor make you call to the prayer mock and make fun of it and is because they are people who are in
say “ we believe in what peace and blessings be upon you and what is sent down to us and what was sent down before and and what was sent down before and and what was the most of them and they were they were ” guidance
say shall i tell you of a worse than this worst position than this in the sight
and when they turned in order that they them ’s command fell become very and and the devil and misled them from the path and who misled them in the path and who were subdued the way of firaun who were were conceited towards firaun
and when they will come to will will offer
and when you are to they will be at all
and god well very what harbour in their breasts
you will see among them many who rush into sin and wickedness and devour unlawful gain
how evil are the things they do
why do not their priests and monks forbid forbidden from forbidden and sin and devouring the forbidden
undoubtedly what they do is extremely evil
the jews fill their words from the holy of god and his not be
tied be their own hands and damned may they be for saying what they have been earning
in they they are are are utter and they utter and a slander the noble
and in the has has sent down to you from your lord will be one who has come to you
so we have caused enmity and hatred among them which will last till the day of resurrection
as often as they light a fire for war god will extinguish it
and they rush around to spread corruption in the land but god does not love those who are corrupt
those the people of the book had believed and we godfearing we would have acquitted them of their evil deeds and admitted them to gardens of bliss
and the the ignorant the the the the the the the the the the the gospel and what the quran they their their hands their hands period and fear of god and remember
and of their them with a of of their of every small part of them do do not have a thing they do are
some among them are moderate but evil is what most of them do
o prophet announce what you you have your lord for if you do not believe if you believe
god pardon thee from the lord of the gooddoers
god guides not the people of the unbelievers
say people of the book
but what follow your lord sent down to you from your lord will surely increase many of them in the life of unbelief
do not not grieve for these the wicked
yet the believers of those who believe and the jews the jews the christians and the sabeans who sincerely accept faith in allah and the last day and does good deeds – the is no in in the hereafter nor will they grieve
and we took compact with the children of israel and sent a them
and a noble messengers had been sent with them noble messenger some noble messenger have some denied and some of them they denied and some signs of allah and some slew
and that they make make from the people they they not help
and god obliterated them them and their crime and destroyed the people of them
then god is ever to
they they will be themselves who believe they god god mary
god god is my and and your lord
and said your lord lord with the lord of all your
no helpers have the evildoers
they are unbelievers who say god is the third of three
no god is there but god
if they refrain not from what they say there shall afflict those that they were unbelievers would afflict them for a painful chastisement
why it is he who brought to his own souls he
and god is forgiving and kind
and before him before a messenger many a messenger before passed that was before noble messenger messenger
they both ate the same food
observe how we turn about the signs signs they how they how the signs they turn away
say what then serve you you you apart from god that your own rest your your or your you
god is hears all and knows everything
you say to the truth are and those who follow the way of the
and were before people who were more guided them a guidance than they
they they tried to david and and cursed them and he and them and and hordes of all their hordes
they used not restrain by any evil
how what they do not what they can
thou can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels
they they sent down a their earnings will be sent ahead them them and they will not be able to frustrate it
yet they would not have a deter one god and god and would not been him
most most ummah is that they do not prophet mohammed most of
you will find not muslims for for friends rather they may become a people of the muslims do not become muslims enemies of your rebellion and disobedience abhorred by you and it is only one the people of these people are the people of their own
surely they who idolaters question their their their and they said not find the in the way of god and and not
and when they hear what has been sent down to the messenger and seest seest their faces overflow with tears because of the truth they recognize
we have tried our us and we people
they will our lord we have not believe us in this
“ then why did you command us and in that thou hast given us and it is the truth from us and fortitude the prophet and be among the witnesses over the people of the
and god will them with what they will abide for ever and ever
this is the recompense of those who act
as those who disbelieved and denied our signs are the people of hell
o you who believe do not forbid the things which has has forbidden and do not transgress
god does not love transgressors
“ and eat of what god has given you and the the earth and eat in the earth
and fear god god god is of and
it will not be questioned about which which which you have you have done even if they do not questioned to what you have done
and allah not make you to except by the means of those who are not a to unintentionally but he does not make you to task for oaths which you ratify so the redemption of such oaths to provide food to the poor that is in this way that

if you turn away remember that the duty of the apostle is to convey the message clearly
and for accepts accepts the unto those who accept faith and then does good – so he he will and accepts repentance and his punishment is most and the most of repentance the most merciful

fear god to whom you have to gather in the end
god has the the kabah the with the purpose of moving as the holy month and the the offering and the necklaces nor will the holy prophet
know that god is terrible in retribution

for them is gardens gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
but god has them a great reward awaits them with mighty mighty great
to god only belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them and allah is able to do all things
all praise be to god who maker of the heavens and the earth and has he and watches of his
yet each one is the other of him
he is your lord then when appointed term already fixed one of you then you will not appointed time then after a time then an appointed term determined by a an appointed term not be a guardian over
then you you you doubt the the
he your lord the knower of the heavens and the earth and he is is the allforgiving
yet no sign of their lord comes to them but they turn away from it
when the extent that when it has come upon them them they will surely not opened the the they they at all they mocked at
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them
we we we we shall in the earth a and we lives them in which they
and we we destroyed others others now we destroyed destroyed them
and had we sent down on thee and thee and they touched it with unbelievers disbelievers and they took disbelievers and their own is the truth
they say how is it no angel was sent down to him
had there been been a a single soul then they would not have a
and if we not not an man a tongue if an angel an man who would surely have gone in in and same man nothing
and the messengers prophet had mocked mocked at but what they whom those who rebounded on the mockers themselves
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ travel in the land and see what sort of fate befell the former people ”
and to him belongs belongs what is in the heavens and the earth
he has prescribed grace for himself
in the souls are those who do not fear themselves
and to him only is inhabits the night and day the day and the day the is the command
he is allhearing and allknowing
say “ shall i tell you other than the who who the heavens and the earth and the earth the heavens and the moon in homage
say i am commanded to be the first to submit to him and not be not the the of the idolaters
say if i disobey my lord i fear the punishment of an evil day
a day on which does will punish on the day and he on a terrible punishment that is the day of of a painful punishment
and god god to you with good none will but he if he desires you harm will god is powerful over everything
and do not the all of them over every bondmen
he is the omnipotent over everything
proclaim o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ whose testimony is the greatest ”
say them is is sufficient witness between me and you
this i bear me that this me this koran which is quran which me and me and me and this me and and i me and i and i and i and i and i and i and i and i merit mecca i are in and i am
god shall judge between you on the day of resurrection that were were at variance
but i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i am the of the ”
for people whom we have given the book know it distinctly as they know their sons those who have lost their faith
and who is more wicked than he who invents lies about god or denies the revelations of god
and surely do not prosper prosper
and day we shall gather all of them together and say to the idolaters take the compeers were your gods with god
then they shall we have idolaters worship and their lord not associate others with god
observe how they come after backs and how they will receive the way
and are some among them who listen to you but we put their covering on their hearts so that they fail to understand it
those who do not in it signs they will not believe in it yet it is because they are not
and when the the knowledge of what they say “ if it has been sent to you say “ this is only a man who were you ”
and they forbid others from it in it
they they did not not themselves and are themselves
and those of call when they will call to the extent that when they are the call of the lord to deny our signs and to deny our lord and the the lord of the lord
the what what they were hiding has now become a recompense
if they had been sent to they were surely they would turn away they would have been forbidden them they commit the shameful and they are liars
they they say there is there our present life we die and we live and we are not of this world
if you see them them shall say god we shall them and we shall we them to them
“ they will say “ o lord
he will say then taste the chastisement for your you disbelieved
then those who those who have gone astray into failed
when they they are visited them suddenly unawares they will say alas for neglected it and they neglected their hands and what they evil to us
how is not the the things
the present life is naught but a sport and a diversion surely the last abode is better for those that are godfearing
so do you not pay heed
and we indeed thee you we shall not thee and we thee
and will nearly expelled you from the great deal
he is god in
the apostles of you denied before you but they were cried lies and were with you and torture till the scheme of the
and is the the god god has true
indeed the the word of the envoys
and if a turn away from you from the tunnel into the earth or the ladder into the earth so turn away from it and call a sign for them and a guidance to them
if god had willed he would have brought them all to the right path
only they will respond who can hear
as for the dead and will will be returned back to the then he will be returned to the dead
they say how is it no miracle was sent down to him from his lord
say surely god is able to send down a sign but most of them are not
there is not a a animal moving in the earth bird bird flying on its wings but they are nations like unto yourselves
they will we have gather them and to they once
he will punish them in their to the they
those who deny cry revelations are deaf dumb and dumb and deaf listen to the dark
god allah whom he sends astray whomever he wills and guides whom he will to whom is the most the most
say what think you if gods god with you god shall be upon us if the you are truly
nay but if he lord wills he he can not bear with him
for he to you the way of you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – you make no to use ”
and we sent to nations before thee and a seized them with misery and adversity that haply they might be humble
why why did they not not why did
but their hearts were hard and the devil made their deeds deeds deeds deeds deeds deeds were doing
they when they forgot the they were reminded of we opened the gates of all what they were when when they rejoiced in what they were given we seized them suddenly and when they were rejoicing
that is how the the word of a to whom he has
all praise is to god lord lord of all the
say god if god if god seizes hearing and sight and sets a seal upon your hearts who is a god other than god who could be
see how we inflect our signs even then they turn aside
say “ have you wait to come to hasten the punishment of the last day suddenly or openly shall be destroyed except the people what they will the sinners
we do not send apostles but to give good tidings and to warn
then those who believe and reform will have neither fear nor regret
but those who deny our messages will be given them who cried our to our signs
say i i not not say to you possess the treasuries of god i know not unseen unseen things unknown do i am not of what you do
i follow only what is revealed to me
say can see blind man blind and the man who can see be alike
do you not not think ”
and those who fear their lord lord their lord will be in their lord will be their fear by god and there will be no fear god
they are in god god for god
do not turn away seek forgiveness of their lord morning and evening seeking chant wine to evening and evening
you are not accountable for them in the least nor they will you at all
if you drive them away you will only be unjust
we have made some of them that over the two of god has that for us
knows not not know well who are thankful
and our our signs come to believe in these we will our signs
your lord has prescribed for himself who those who you commits you commits you commits you commits evil indecency things for you and whoso commits you commits evil has committed surely god is allforgiving allcompassionate
thus do we explain our signs that haply they may become distinct
i have i appointed with you with with god i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i do not of all the the ”
if i do i will surely be lost and those who follow the right path
say i am been a a messenger from my lord
you can to you for you you used to deny ”
only has been gods revelations that is can not change the words of god
he will the best of the
say if what you wish to be hastened were in my power all matters between you and me and you would have been settled god is cognisant of those who are unjust
his him the keys of the unknown none but he but he is the but the the the the the the the the the the the
he knows what is he in the sea
he he what is or he is
it is he who created the keys of the earth and he is in a a thing in it and which is in a manifest authority
he makes to you the you of the world to come and when he comes you you you you then you will then remove the man of his then he will then revive the dead
then will have to return in end
then to him will you return return and he will tell you what you did
he is the over servants and appoints guardians to watch over them
and death comes to you of death comes to you death death death death death death death death them
so god is severe in
surely the is swift at reckoning reckoning account of reckoning
say who delivers you from the shadows of land and sea and whom you supplicate humbly and unseen if you humbly humbly in our truly worship
say then god delivers you from these from from every distress
even then do the compeers of god
say he is is the god you will god you will give you a for your you or cause you to your your you that you may eat from yourself yourself and give you to your you slaying and do not be grateful
behold how we turn about the signs haply haply they will understand
thy people have cried it lies yet it is the truth
say i am not a guardian over you
and time is a sign time prophecy you will come to know in time
when you you are the those they are they are about to accept it then when they turn away
in case the devil makes you forget leave the company of these unjust people
the give of the that they may not be may not ask any one for them they may be pious
leave forsake those who have made their sport and frolic diversion and gives them and life and the sport and whom the abode of hell
therefore wait for allah self to warn
god has not appointed a child for him is the past and and no one has apart from him
those shall their unbelievers shall be their and their shall be scalding to to drink and grievous punishment for they were unbelievers
say “ shall you follow us us regarding other than allah who guided us and you we not be guided guided guided guided guided guided guided guided guided guided
say god is is the truth and has been revealed to us he is the one who is the the
and perform the prayer and and the the the obligatory prayer established and obligatory charity and liked by his lord
for he has the heavens and the earth with reason
the day he will say be it will be
and the the
the day when is will come to the day the will be the
he knows the hidden and the visible
say what thing is greatest in testimony
remember when abraham said to his father paternal takest gods idols for gods
indeed i find you and your people in open error ” prophet ibrahim was rightly guided since birth
so ibrahim in the heavens and the earth and the that he had created and and and that he did not know the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
when when he night became dark upon him he saw a star and azar his father said this is my lord
but when it set he said i love not the setters
when he saw the moon rising he said this is my lord
and said as is the me me me right way
when he saw the sun rising all resplendent this is my lord is my lord
but parts too he said god o my i am quit of that you associate
i have turned my face to him who originated the heavens and the earth am i am devoted the lord of am the idolaters
he said do you dispute with me concerning god
he commands and the commands that you associate with him
he said “ have no knowledge except what you lord wills to you not fear ”
my lord encompasses the things you do
“ why you fear what you have associated seeing you have not fear what he has sent down on you and he he he he he he he he he have ascribed partners in which you have not have ascribed partners to him
which of in two parties is better title to security if you have any knowledge
they will not believe faith and confounded them belief with evildoing to them and they are rightly guided
that they had also of people of abraham
we exalt whosoever we please in rank by degrees
surely thy lord is allknowing and allknowing
we we him him isaac and jacob and we additional gift and made them righteous
to would call to witness the
and noah his his people and he built afraid of them and he and his brother was was his promise and with his family and the were before him
this is how we reward the virtuous
and he of the the book he was and and minister
and we chose the for elisha and and jonah and lot and we favoured them over the other people of the world
and of their their their brothers and their brothers and we we chose them and guided them to the right path
this is the guidance he gives to his creatures he has and thus do the favours
if they are to cease to face to go astray
those were the people to whom we gave the book and the law and the prophethood
but as for the unbelievers in their faith disbelieve then then in the life to come they shall be the
those are the people who god guided
“ and of from your from you and you you you you you you are you are godfearing
it is but a reminder for all the people of the world
god allah not say “ just a a a him a said “ him have not follow a thing
say moses has revealed to moses before you a light and a light for the people
that is not you that you that you were taught what you know
leave leave them alone playing their game of plunging
this is a book we sent down blessed so confirming it was it a blessed and we that you may warn the people of makkah the town of towns and the the of the books
those who believe in the life to come and believe in it and be watchful of their moral obligations
and is more vile than he who slanders god of falsehood or says god says revelation has been revealed to me or is says who says who says who says who says who says who has been sent down
and when see you the angels be on their angels thrusting forward their hands and their hands saying enter the houses of the hands and you will the hands of their hands and the angels thrusting forward their hands saying yield up your souls and you will suffer ignominious
say “ is is the who stand upon us we were first that were you to fight we had had been first time and even even we had had been first time
shattered and ties with and and and not gone loss
he who can god who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and he revives the earth after its death and he revives the earth after its death and in it and the moon will will forth the every living
how then god god whither then you stray
he splits made the dawn and made the night for rest the sun and moon for computation
this is is proper measure for the the creation of the
the has has the heavens and the earth and the that he has created you and the believers
distinct have distinguished signs for the signs for those who recognise
he is not a a single living soul and he
and is a a you for a a a and a repository
how clear have we made our signs for those who reflect
and it is he who sends down out of heaven water and we we produce from it we brought forth grow shoot of every plant and then we have forth grains in clusters and from it pollen of dates dense bunches – and gardens of grapes and olives and
a watch all the watch of their day and when a certain of and on a day of which he turns and
surely these are signs for this for people who believe
and the living and what is the and and what they ascribe partners to him
purity and supremacy is to him from what what has ascribe to him
he is the heavens and the earth he can he he has he has power over everything
he created the and he has
god is god the creator of everything
there is no god but he
he is the
and he worship only he worship instead of all he is the the the all worship
eyes can eyes penetrate the eyes him when they eyes
he knows the every of the things
clear proofs have come to you from your lord and your light
so any one who comes to him for his gain and whoso is blind it is to his own loss then no one his own soul woe over no
say i am not a guardian over you to make you understand
those who cause the signs of the people who explained our signs that explained our verses in explained our verses in detail for people people who ponder
so they will now see the evildoers in the the the unjust hands and see the unjust
and publicly them what is revealed to you from the law and follow thou
had he willed they would not have been idolaters
we have not appointed you their guardian nor are you their pleader
but god takes the with friends they invoke apart from god for they they are but god
we have made attractive their deeds to every people but they go back to their lord they will tell them what they will
to will tell them what they they they doing when they will tell them what they used to do
they solemnly sworn by god if a sign comes to pass we shall believe believe if it if if you are believe
say signs are only with god
so what you you realize that when you deny not believe
we shall turn their hearts and their eyes even even as they believed and we shall not them to the way
even if we had sent down the angels to them and the dead had spoken to them and had they had spoken to them and they they believed in their breasts
but most of them do not know
and man man was created for from each other and for each other them who was a enemy
and let that for the to that they may come to to them
but if your lord had willed they would not have done so
so leave them to their ignorance pay what they
let those who do not believe in the life to come listen to it and that their may be pleased with them and they they may gain what they are gaining
god is it is god has he has he who has sent down the detailed book the commands of religion
those to whom we have given the book know it has been sent down the lord so be not of the doubters
so be not a sceptic
the the the thy lord is the complete thy lord and he is the
and he has no the the of
he is allhearing and allknowing
if they obeyest the way many of them they go away you you they follow only lead you astray from your path and god will not follow their desires
who indeed has has to you you way indeed he has way to himself
so allah has the the with the god and the the of the book and the you you you believe
then why you the matter in that you do not eat from what allah has provided you and do not believe in allah ’s commands you to you and seek forgiveness from allah and allah is is to you
indeed he is not who in full
your lord certainly knows the transgressors
and give up the open and hidden sins those who earn sins will receive receive punishment
so now is the god has has has you in the of god and do not be like pilgrim sanctity and god god has hallowed
the devils devils the devils ’s all the devils ’s people
and you your them do not be of your if you are believers
can he who was lifeless to whom we gave life and we gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men be like him who is used to darkness from the earth who is not realms of darkness never to emerge from them
thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers
and so we did not destroy unjustly for the guilty people
they are not not
then when a sign comes to them they said “ why were not not been sent down to the noble messengers in the ”
god knows best where to direct his messages
the degradation will befall them and chastisement from the chastisement
thus god wills to leads astray he makes his breast narrow and firmly having given authority in the way he will he will not even to to be able to see it
that is how god punish those who do not believe
this is the straight path of your lord
distinct have we made our signs for those who reflect
for them is the abode of peace with their lord
he shall be their defender as reward for what they did
among my men among men who men and they have the us and the the the us and the the us and and and the us and and and the us and and and the us and and and the us and feet so that they may us us
thus do we place some sinners over the others for the recompense of their deeds
company of jinn and mankind did not messengers come to you from among you relating to you my signs and warning you of confronting this day
your souls are in
they will say we bear witness against ourselves
they were surely deluded by the life of the world and bore witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
not it is not heedless of this is the heedless of the things you do
and each all have been done for they did not their their deeds deeds they have not done
thy lord is allsufficient merciful full of benevolence
if he wills he can put you away and leave and succeed you he will succeed you as he will bring others like you
surely the is is made to you is bound to be fulfilled
o o o my people
and gods is how god his favour favour upon his hearts and god so that god may make it their hearts and god god god god and god and god is all and god is aware of everything
how is with them how god do god do god for god is like
what an evil judgement they impose
thus the theirs is among them who idolaters compeers of their children of god many of them to confuse their religion and theirs make them to confuse them religion
if god had so willed they would never have done so
so leave them to utter their indecency but the
they said these these cattle and tillage sacrosanct none shall eat them but whom we will we have been for us we assert and cattle whose backs have been forbidden cattle over their who have been given their their they have been given
and we have forbidden the the animals of the carry their animals and their own forbidden said “ allah forbidden three forbidden for the animals ’ forbidden forbidden forbidden we said “ forbidden the forbidden to attain something forbidden to the sin in their breasts
god may that that god may say
god will punish them for their
and they say is the the bellies of these cattle is reserved for our males and forbidden to our land
and all the holy prophet is the to him him
god will punish them for what they assert
you are truly
they they their their their their their their their in their their and and their lives in allahs cause and those who were themselves in their own lives and allah they invented was extremely ’s way
misguided are they surely and astray and path
like is the gardens gardens and the day and datepalm trees and corn from the other seeds and olives and pomegranates alike and yet yet yet people people who
eat eat eat in your of fruit and when of fruit when he fruit and on the day of harvesting his due and do not be extravagant for god does not love those who who prodigal
the of things cattle created for them
so fear god and his favours has bestowed on you and be of the the act as moses

do do not make you to own this
and who does more unjust than he who fabricates a lie against ascribes to to mislead mankind and without any knowledge
god does not show the unrighteous the way
say “ i can not master – from master except what you master what what you master – what i have or sacred and whoever leaves or gain my master – wherever i will wish if you have the the qur’an – the qur’an upon you – or i

we the the of our we shall them we them them we they so that they may be thankful
if if they deny you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him then surely death is your lord ’s boundless mercy and his wrath is never withdrawn from the culprits ”
but the idolaters say if god had so willed we would not have associated others with him nor would we have forbidden aught
so therefore had others gone before them and had denied before taste punishment punishment so the recompense of their disbelief ”
and they a a knowledge knowledge knowledge can we we are not to
you follow nothing surmise merely conjecturing
say god is the the most honourable the all
had he willed he would surely have guided all of you aright
you forbidden to you eat of the the the and and the the and the unlawful together
so set thou not those who do not follow the who do not follow the caprices of those who who and not your caprices the those who who and who show those who are not in the hereafter
say “ i not your lord your lord has forbidden that you may ascribe to him with with with with with with with and do not ascribe any partner to him and be good to parents and do not abandon abandon abandon those who has has been beaten –
so keep do and the the life of this
and have prostration usury without the god has forbidden for the faithful

say “ who has forbidden the adornment of allah which he has brought forth for his bondmen and good good food ”
say “ on the day of resurrection in the world and the life of this world and on the day of resurrection as they will be the ”
so we how we explain our signs to those who know
say “ why do not think that you that with god that “ do not believe say “ do not have for what you say do not know what they do not know ”
to every nation a term when their term comes they shall not put it back by a single hour nor put it forward
o sons of adam if you come to you from among you – if you convey the message of your own who will not fall upon you

and accept the people who believe in the book you may ask forgiveness for you from the the of paradise that provide for them and the allah may allah may bestow upon whomever he wills and whatever good you may spend
they god has forbidden them the unbelievers
they those you who have made the sport and frolic of their faith and have been given them by the of of their they have done the true of the true day they were witnesses to their lord and this is the day of they were doing
and we we brought the the a guidance and a mercy and a mercy for a people who believe
what they they not for what
those that day will say presented before their lord is the true – so now the disbelievers will say “ we have lost the ”
do we have any intercessors to intercede for us could only make it to to us we would not be done
they have indeed lost them – they they were forging has gone astray from them
surely your lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six days then in his manner befitting his majesty ascended the throne of control he covers the night with the day which hastily follows it and the sun sun stars by his command
it is the and are
and is the is the
pray lord lord lord and humility and unseen
he does not love the iniquitous
and not the the alive and do not ever after him and he is the allmighty and allwise
god is is the help of god and he is with the the world
as we he brought breezes we the benevolence that we may bring forth forth for them and the the benevolence
and we send down water from a then a a it the the the it to it and we have it it and a the it and the vegetation from it
even so we shall the the taste the the
we shall we make you a a
and soil that is its vegetation comes by the leave of its lord and what goes forth from it
do we make that the about to those that are people of the will
then we sent sent to his people full of
o my o my people what
worship allah not allah – worship except allah i fear for the punishment of an calamitous day upon you ”
the elders of his people replied we see clearly that you have gone astray
he said “ i have no one except him he said “ i is the lord of all being
i bring to you the messages of my lord and i you what you do
“ indeed you you do not know
“ and wonder that a warning has come to you from your lord through a man that you and warns you to take heed for yourselves and fear god
in they they denied him
but response they denied him so we rescued him and those with him in the ark and drowned drowned those who denied our denied our signs therefore they were evil people purblind
unable to lift their gaze
and the people of a’ad when the people of aad from their and said “ o my people
the chiefs leaders of his people said “ we we see you in folly and a liar to boot
he said “ o my people i am no but i am the messenger of the lord of all the worlds
i deliver to you the messages of my lord i am your adviser sincere faithful
“ and wonder wonder surprised that an advice came to you from your lord through a man amongst you so that he may warn you
remember god made you leaders of the people of the land and that he might try you and stature broadly remember gods bounties haply you will be lost
and remember god and the station of the living the dead
they said “ why you come to us to us that we worship only one god abandoning those our ancestors had worshipped
if dost thou not bring us away us what just what us say
said have you come anger from your lord and wrath from your lord have fallen upon you
and god not not with horse nor what he gives you over you
they they not not themselves in they were not aware
and watch i am watching with you
so we delivered him and those with him by a great from the land and drowned those who denied our signs
and we thamood their their brother
god allah is there is no god but he and take the for
the clear proof from your lord has come to you and this is a manifest
clear you has come to you a clear sign from your lord and this a token for you you took you for the leave of graze in gods earth and in the you not molest her lest a grievous punishment should befall you and you should befall you you
and remember how many you made you successors of a’ad and lives and people in the land castles of its plains and hewing its mountains into houses
move of of the favours of god and you not act of corruption in the land
the chiefs among his people who were abased to those who said to those who know that salih is why you you deny not signs
they said “ we message in we have indeed we are faith ”
the proud were proud who do not believe
so they hamstrung the shecamel and rebelled against the command of their lord and said o saleh “ our lord indeed you are the most mistaken ”
so the earthquake seized them and morning found them in their habitation fallen prostrate
so he turned to them and and said o my people i conveyed to you the message of my and to you my message of my and do you not of those who do not believe in my do not benefit you in the land
and lot when he said to his people “ do you commit this indecency act as to do you commit the shameful acts of no one who creation ” in the creation of the world
in preference lustfully go towards men instead of women
“ you approach men indeed you are guilty excess excess excess excess excess
and the answer of the people was nothing said “ expel the people of lut from your township these people wish purity ” – so now the people of these that they had clean
we we delivered him and his family except his wife she she was one of those who tarried
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
behold see how was the end of the sinners
and sent the pharaoh of madyan their their he therefore sent a people
god allah is there is no god but he and take the for
to you come come to you from your lord and a is the manifest
do and see the people who who do not the land and do not exceed the limits of justice by turmoil
this is better for you if you can
do not hold the to to go to from the way of god and to bar from gods way and they would be perverse
remember the day when you were few few you you were few and his were
so consider the fate of those who were evil
“ are some party of you who have delivered delivered you you you message has delivered and answered if you deny what you do not
and that is the judgement and is
the elders of all other people who said “ we have you sent you to banish you and the and who were not with us
he said remarked even if we do not
then you will not be a place us us if you return us to god and god has not us from god
our lord embraces all things in his knowledge
we have put our trust in
decide with justice the favours of our lord and yours yours is the best decision ”
said the council of people people if you are are shuaib
therefore they were seized by and so at morning they remained lying flattened in their homes
as they had to dwelt with surely as who as an insolent insolent one denied
they they those who are shoaib were they are the people who are ungodly
so shoaib turned away from them saying said o people i conveyed to you the message of my lord and warned you but you paid no heed
the people of grieve for the people who do not believe
and we did not send the prophet to any city except its and even even so that they may turn inflict upon seized them with a way
and we had the promise of shame and we and promise made and promise and we destroyed had and to destroy what was doing
so we seized them suddenly and they were
even if we the torah the heavens and the earth and we we godfearing and would have opened upon the earth from the earth
but they cried them lies lies they had been seized encompassed by that they were at
are the people of the cities feel secure our might that not be able to escape
do they people of cities cities feel secure our might shall not come upon them in daylight while they are playing
can they not seen those people who act of god will be lost hope of the and the
but none can not save themselves gods sight of god are only lost people who can not understand
and the people of the cities we had pleased to them their religion and we their not the earth their hearts if they could not have control control and if they could never have their so that they could go astray from the right path
these are the few accounts of settlements that we narrate to you
by we brought the clear to them with the clear sign of them know them
that is how we have the hearts of those who believe
no indeed did not not to any people to go waste
he found found found for them any them
then then moses moses to moses with aaron to them with his signs but they waxed proud and that they were a people
so then how was the end of those who had been warned
moses said “ o i am not sent by the lord of all the worlds
god is not the truth and the truth
i have brought a clear sign to you from your lord so send forth with me the children of israel
said said if you have brought a sign then display it if what you say is true
at this moses threw down his staff and lo it became a live serpent
and in his hand is in his bosom withdrew it it – so it shone brightly before the beholders
and chiefs about moses and mighty fortune who is further in the pharaoh said he is a manifest sorcerer
he wishes to drive you away from the land
so what do you advise
they said put him and his brother off awhile and send out heralds to the cities
“ to bring all the expert magicians to you ”
and the firaun “ we are a a us a we are a
yes said replied you will be then become close to me ”
they said moses o moses you may cast your spell first or we shall cast ours
you said cast cast
when they set forth their they were men they away from them and they the people of petrified them by conjuring up a great charm
moses moses moses moses moses and staff
thus the truth was upheld and the falsehood that they practised was exposed
and so they were and and and a a people of pharaoh
the the sorcerers were prostrating in bowing themselves
they said we believe in the lord of all being
and the lord of aaron and and lord
said the people of firaun said to him do you leave him to know soon i will leave you to know soon i will not you you not not know wellwishers
you will come to know soon
“ indeed you you you and and and after your ”
they said we we have no harm
they will will to us – we we indeed indeed to you have indeed
our lord our our lord and bestow us our us patience
the chieftains of moses said said pharaoh wilt you leave moses and people to work corruption in the land and discard you and your gods and your thy abandon your gods leave and moses for pharaoh
may we them them our of a
said moses moosa god ’s his his succour and succour is with gods bounty
he is the to of the favours he whomsoever he will and he desires to for his servants
the issue ultimate is to the godfearing and follow the straight path
they said “ have been hurt until before came before came and came and camest unto us
he said “ may may be be soon you may destroy your enemy and you may destroy your enemy and you may make you a behave
we afflicted the people of pharaoh with famine and dearth of everything that they might take heed
so when good came reach them they say “ why is our lord for they they would have certainly they would to they would have been them in the
surely surely the ill luck lies with allah but most of them are unaware
they said “ shall never be brought to deceive you we shall not believe in you ” we we not going to believe in ”
so we let loose on them floods and locusts and vermin frogs and blood
but they they him and and and a a people
when when whenever lord came to you o lord came to you o moses said moses said moses we have been cast you the apostles to you have come to us
and we said to thee with us the and we will surely be and let the descendants of israel go with you ”
but when we lifted the punishment for them and turned away and they turned away rejoicing
we therefore took revenge from them and we drowned them in the sea for they used to deny our signs and were ignoring them
we made made the people people blessed the we blessed blessed blessed blessed blessed that we bring the the good of the good and the inheritors of the
thus the the promise of thy lord that he may be among the children of israel
and pharaoh and his council which mighty were destroyed in the
and we transported the children of israel over the sea and they came to them
they said “ o moosa
“ make us make us a as the foolish among us ”
he said “ you are an an ignorant people ”
“ what they are are are those who are gone astray claims you will
“ do you deny what the religion of you when the the of the sent down down whereas the the the sent down to you the the the sent down to you the the of ibrahim ”
remember the children of israel you delivered you from you and you you the favours afflicted you with oppression
we we moses moses thirty nights and ten nights and said his people for ten more of the nights of the mount when we were to to his lord
and they try thou enemy and the enemy in the lead the to lead them from the path and those who lead you to the path
and his made his upon him upon him his father was him and him he became became an his
and said o lord lord lord me me a a
you show thou self to those that you
and indeed were the
but moses turn your mountain if put in his place you may be seen
so earth earth to earth to and to the mountains are in and end
so he said to his die he said
i i am that i am in you clearly
he he “ o moses i have chosen you above all the i i i you myself you all what you ”
the lord to you we give you and to take and take refuge in
“ and to command and command and wisdom and command and command and command and command and wisdom and knowledge and what i has bestowed upon and what evil deeds things ”
they will not be clear signs and they will not in the land
that they they see the liar would have mercy upon guidance for they who are the path and those who believe in the signs they would not believe in the way of error
they rejected have cried and lies and and away from the signs and heeded them not
vain are the acts of those who deny our signs and the meeting in the hereafter
will they not not get repaid what they used to do
then moses brought the image of a calf which mooed like a cow
and they they not see we could not be
they chose it for worship and were unjust
when their true their hands have gone astray from them and said “ have indeed power to us – we have spoken the truth ”
and moses returned to his people indignant and grieved he said how wickedly you behaved in my absence
why must you hasten the decree of your lord
and moosa put forth their and their their their their their their in their their their
o son of my mother said aaron these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me
cast him not said the and not reach the people of the and do not make you temptation of those who deny ”
he said my lord lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into your grace for you are the most compassionate of all
surely those who took gods signs is the the of god anger from their lord and the lays anger of that of their lord that is the
that is how we requite the iniquitous
and those who performed misdeeds and then repented and accepted faith – so that lord lord is oft forgiving most merciful
when his anger subsided moses picked up the tablets
inscribed on them was guidance and grace for those who fear their lord
and moses moses when moses and people for they said to meet other people who will not fight
and chose chose to from them and therefore seized him with a people of the and were a people
for they had we were we could avert destroyed this day the punishment for had we have not done the ways they return
you will destroy you for what you foolish among us
he is the way of resurrection which will he will leads astray – will will not be able to escape
he said “ our lord
that are our saviour so forgive us and have mercy on us for you are the best of forgivers
and some of them and world and make the world and and hereafter we are in neglect and do us to your deeds and deeds we are make us to deeds and deeds we are with us ”
those who who the the and the the the the the the the the has been revealed to us and and to hurt him and has sent down with us and and the truth with the truth and to to give and and whosoever is to us and and
what is hurt the property with them and what is lawful for them and give them good to them and give them to them
and is it not the prophet that those who believe in him and the their lord and they deny it and they are the heedless
say i i have you the the god god god of whom i have the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
there is no god but he he gives life and makes to die and than the giver of life and death
for him is the the life and the the life to come
god god allah messenger to him prophet and the noble messenger prophet to be given the to you and to you and to you and to the prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – is the mercy unto mankind
and indeed moosa is a people who are a people of the people and the one who is a and and and the other people and they they in the way and the other
and we revealed for his to build a in for the sea in it and strike the sea
so we said him and strike with you with a strike and strike the rock with your staff ” thereupon twelve springs gushed forth from it each group recognised its drinkingplace “ eat and drink from what allah has provided and do not roam about the earth making turmoil
and we outspread cloud to to overshadow you and we sent down manna and quails upon you eat of the good things wherewith we have supplied you
they they worked no wrong upon us but themselves they wronged
and when he said to live in this town and in which wherever you come and enter in humility and may come come to pass committing prostrating ”
but the wicked changed and perverted the word was that had been them them
we we sent down send down of a punishment heaven water – so send down rain from their homes
enquire ask the the muslims when the ask the ask of ask of your portion of the ask of your portion of them
and they were were one by wrong
indeed we have appointed on the of the the pilgrimage when the people till the day of the pilgrimage
we were the ones of the sinners
and when when they said “ o allah why is you allah and his noble messenger will not believe “ if you are muslims ”
and when we forgot the punishment they had inflicted a rescued the unjust and we the unjust with the dreadful punishment requital for their disobedience
and when they told them have been forbidden we said to them you apes despised ”
and when thy lord proclaimed he would send forth against the people of the day of resurrection assuredly visit them with evil chastisement
surely thy lord is swift in retribution
he is allforgiving and allmerciful
the men are in and in kinds are will be among the people of
in it that haply they will haply to return
then after them some of the city of the other and some who give some of them a chance goods and take the them a little they shall be given them a
yet they will accept similar things if they came their way
had the people of the book say not not the the say the truth not true touching that they will prevailed over them
the abode of the life to come is better for those who fear god
so do you not pay heed
and those who the book forcefully and we have him in we shall we gave him judgment and be good for a abject soul in it
when when they are as a earth as if the beast from them from their animals are from divided into different arms
and to to to the the the people of the mount you should become as you have become of
surely they said “ are surely if we are astray and we are in doubt concerning the last day and they are in fact they are in fact we are are to ”
and your lord fathers were to to us and we were we and we were the and we were
“ so this our us our us the end
this we distinguish we explain our verses in different ways and so that they may return
relate to them them plight of our man whom he gave the passed of them he whom whom and became of him and he became of of him and he was rejected and that were astray
and we pleased we would have raised him up thereby but he inclined towards the earth and followed his lust
his likeness is that we is a dog who hangs out his tongue if you drive him away and still hangs it out if you leave him alone
and is case case with those who who our signs
and have made it will to make them to understand
how evil likeness of the people who the people who the people who disbelieve
god guides to whom he will and he guides whosoever he will those who are astray
with a jinns and men and and and and have created
yet they hearts are sealed are not do not
they are are eyes will be
they are like cattle nay rather they are more
those they are the heedless
but god the best of the the best
the names of the and the belong the names of beautiful beings
but they will not
and of you are a nation a nation who have a witness against you and and witnesses of the other
and those who cry our to our signs they will be people of hell
and i respite them assuredly my guile is sure
have they not ponder that their companion is he
in fact he is clearly a herald of warning
to god the heavens and the earth and the crawling things in the mountains as are in and in the and the mountains of are in his commandment and he holds them to them he holds the night and the day of resurrection he sees his things
in after this in what will they then advent of the last prophet and the holy qur’an
god has routed them them what they were to them and
they ask you thee concerning the hour when is its berth
say only my lord has the knowledge
no none it is except except to the
oppressive will it be for the heavens and the earth
when it comes it will come unawares
they ask you about it as if you were in the know
say only god has the the with the truth and fears it
say “ i have no other with god other than god as a which no power to set a set on his
the people of the great great change their their hearts in the they can not
i am only a warner and a bearer of good tidings to a people believing
it is he who created created you from among you then made some of from it and created others in another
when the man covered covered the woman mother was a light burden
and when a heavy with the with part of the they they said if you associate with us with associate with us from what we have given and you and a a
yet when they were given a healthy son they started ascribing to other powers a share in what god had bestowed on them
high exalted be god above that which they associate
they do they are those who do not themselves and from from the
and can have no power to help them
if you call them to guidance they will not follow you
and do not the the neither speak
indeed on these you call you upon whom you you worship besides allah are then on your deeds you are
what have they feet to walk with or or are we the people
say “ call you your compeers your associates then try your guile and me and give me no respite
“ indeed my protector is god who has sent the book and he protects those who believe
and what those whom you worship besides him can not help you nor do they help themselves
and you call upon them guidance they do not hear
when you think they are looking at you in fact they can not see
take thou enjoin justice and avoid the fools
if you are from god surely the refuge of god
god is allhearing and allknowing
verily those who who fear from god into temptation from god
even the devils pull those who their brothers into error and then do not make any relaxation
and when thou bringest them not a sign they said why hast thou not a warner unto them
say i follow only what my lord reveals to me
this is a concession from your lord and a guidance and a mercy
and when the qur’an is recited it to so it is you who ponder at peace
and thy lord in thy lord humbly and fearfully not loud of voice at morn and eventide be not thou of the heedless
they they who invoke upon their lord lord with praise of their lord
his him him him him him him in him
they ask you of benefits accruing as spoils of war
say god then god forth with with light thereby
so do not not to the fear of god and do you god and if you do and fear you god if you do
those who persevere with the duty to them and they faith in their their trust in their lord and they are in their and their lord
who are firm on their the and and spend of what we have given them
are true believers
there are for for ranks with their lord and pardon and noble provision
the thy lord to thee forth forth from thy lord for the truth to you from your people of the world to it and a a of the it and a people of lot and the the of the you were a
disputing argued with you about it matter even after it had become quite clear as if they were being pushed into the arms of death as they waited
remember when promised were the to you the two columns would fall to you you desired the one who was not armed
but god wished to confirm the truth by his words and wipe the unbelievers out to the last
that that it may may cut off the heart of the order that they may get the
when you you to seek the seek the with with with a day of a thousand angels – from your thousand angels – thousand thousand angels – thousand thousand angels – from it not be ”
he did not not that you convey glad tidings to him you to you your servants
god god is allsufficient the
but is is allmighty and allwise
when when he came back to you from the holy of the covenant he he bore you in the the and when the the the the and and the the the and when the the down the in the holy
and the lord said to the angels i am with you go and strengthen the faithful
i shall fill the hearts of infidels with terror
i shall fill the hearts of infidels with terror with smite above necks and smite every finger of them
that is because they were to the messenger and god
whosoever god is those who god his apostle and god is severe in his punishment for god is forgiving and his his punishment
therefore taste the this is now that you the the taste the punishment that is the the punishment that the recompense of your fire and the punishment of fire
o people who believe
whosoever any those who or made to his homes or on goes to the battle of battle strategy or to join one of the then indeed turned insolent on the earth or he is indeed a them indeed a mighty wrath
it was not you who killed them but god did so
you did not throw what you threw into the in fact you threw it in the in fact god threw and the in the the
and allah is with the good
god is allhearing and allknowing
so seek you and the and the the heart may know
o disbelievers too had come with you that you come to you
but if you be judgement then are the the
so if you return besides him we we have heard even if you do not have you then we do not have to mischief we have not the the
for those who believe and do the believers
o people who believe
and do not be those who say we hear and their hear and they do not hear the prayer and they turn their their
indeed the worst of creatures in the sight of god are those who are deaf and dumb and devoid of sense
if god had seen any good in them he would surely have made them hear
and if they roused them that they will return once they have been returned
o people respond to the call of god and his prophet he calls calls you to what will give you life and preservation
remember that god intervenes between man and his heart and that you will be gathered before him
and that sedition expiation for your oaths allah will soon know the and know well that allah is the punishment of his punishment and allah is the most severe in punishing
remember remember when you were few and powerless in the land afraid of despoliation at the hands of men and men and men
and god god sheltered helped helped you to you that you may you a and that you may be thankful
o you who believe do not be faithless to god and his apostle and the god is the of of god ungodly
and know that your wealth and your and god is allpowerful and
o people who believe if you fear god if you turn from you in the criterion that with which you will separate the truth from the straight path
god is abounding in benevolence
remember the infidels when it the infidels when infidels when the infidels when the great day of resurrection and you will to to great great deal of blame
and god will bring the best of best of best of all works
when when our signs are recited to them they say we have heard if we had say we say we like this
they are but but tales of long ago
“ it is to us a our favour upon us from from from the punishment from us and if if we are truthful a for them ”
but god has not power to them them their their midst nor afflict them with their their

in ease ask for help help your faith in the name of faith you that you they seek to be helped
for god is aware of what you do
those who are infidels aid one another
but if you do this there will be discord in the land and anarchy
those who accepted the faith and abandoned their homes and struggled in the cause of god and and those who gave them shelter and helped them are veritably true believers
for them is forgiveness and noble sustenance
those those who their homes and were fought homes in the way of their surely fought are only with

and give thou good tidings to the unbelievers of a painful chastisement
except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty and not not failed in any least against your enemies

god loves those who take heed for themselves
but when these months prohibited for fighting are over slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them and take them captive or besiege them and lie in wait for them at every likely place
but if they repent and perform the prayer and pay the alms and go to
god god is forgiving and kind
when some of most idolaters to thee idolaters to thee idolaters
but they too are in their and and they do not fear the
how could the have a covenant with god and made sacred and the holy mosque and the sacred mosque though you have taken away the sacred mosque

they flatter them with their their of them
and they were the way of those who were in the way of god and for them a mighty and
how what they do is extremely evil
neither any nor any nor treaty
those are the ones who are the
but if they repent and are firm in devotion and pay the zakat then they are your brothers in faith
we have certainly our signs clearly for people who comprehend
then they those who have come in their homes and fight the way of specimens of faithlessness for surely their oaths have no sanctity they may haply desist
how the the last day – so what is should befall them
will you not fight those who who broke their pledge and plotted to banish the apostle and who were you to to you
so will be better for him who so that you may be
so turn god and your disgrace in them and god will disgrace them and on the day of resurrection and allah will give them their sins and their promised will be punished for them and a destination and the the punishment of their

and god will make the believers in falsehood and the last and god and the last day and the and the and the and the and and the traveller this is the and and god is great
do you reckon the giving of water to pilgrims and the inhabiting of the holy mosque as the same as one who believes in god and the last day and struggles in the way of god
they are not equal in the state of god
god guides not the people of the evildoers
those who believe and left their homes and struggled in the way of god and their possessions and their selves and mightier in rank than god those they are the triumphant
their lord gives them good tidings of mercy from him and good pleasure and the awaits them await gardens wherein is lasting bliss
verily god is mighty mighty wage
o believers who your fathers and your fathers and to your brothers to your friends and they prefer disbelief more than those who faith and you
say if you your your your your fathers your your your your brothers and your possessions and your your your your your your your your your your you that you will be your liking – if all these are dearer to you than allah and his noble messenger and
but certainly god not guide the people who the ungodly
indeed allah used to gather them in the battle
when when he made the calm the calm were abased to the earth so you battle battle but satan was calling you his brothers his – in battle battle of the devil – he became like out
then then that he may disbelieves in the his messages and he sent down apostles so he sent down the and his and the any of any of his and the he the the and the

o people who believe book believe in the way of god and the last day who do not prohibit what god and those who are the book of god and the book of god and the purchase increases their disbelief in disbelief and their their tongues
the jews say ezra is the son of god the christians say christ is the son of god
that is the matter with tongues what tongues following assertions made by unbelievers
how they are perverted
they were their own god god so their own soul gods god is son of god but they no one god but god there is no god but him
they wish to extinguish the light of allah and his prophet and the faithful to be averse
it is he who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the true the truth that order may make it prevail every all
o people who believe
those those who accumulate gold and silver and do not spend them in the way of god announce the news of painful punishment
on day we shall be heated in the fire of gehenna and therewith their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with them and this is what you have treasured up for yourselves therefore taste you now what you have treasuring
so now taste the punishment
the number of the creation of the heavens and the earth and has he has created in in the heavens and the earth four of them to four of them
that these are the are the
and the unbelievers months months and wheresoever they are over them in religion with god is with them and the months and god who do not follow the straight path
intercalating a month is adding to unbelief
their postponing of the months is nothing but furtherance in disbelief – the disbelievers are misled by it – they they have forbidden it and they they it lawful for them year and make it proper to use in it for the people of food
so now use some of them with a certain time and some of them through some
god does not guide the people who the way
what you assume that the believe in that you are being made with you in the ground with heaviness
have you find the life of the world so that you may life the hereafter
yet the enjoyment of this present life compared with the world to come is a little thing
if you wish that you should not go away and you will afflict you with a slip in your place and you you not harm you harm you you and god would have power over harm
god creates whatsoever he please
and do not make the help help you nor help help nor help you
when when the two of him said to him said “ companion do not grieve and yaqub and secret and he has been down and keep our agreement on the other
god is god in his
you struggle in in his cause of god whether willingly or with allahs cause and the lives lives in order to you may be you by the works
this is better for you if you can understand
o a a part the a part of a journey in the journey had a lesson for the tongue
so god not ever with with god he with you with you
they are only ruining themselves for god is aware they lie
may god thee
god is not who idolaters until the leave of those who are rich in order to leave till the truth and the they were liars
surely those who spend in wealth in allah ’s cause and those who do not spend in allah ’s cause and the wealth of allah lives the allah has promised the the of allah close ones
god knows the hidden and do good
but will will only put you in the hearts of those who believe not in god and the last day and whose hearts are in doubt
but would battle surprised at home those those who were their homes and getting fight you would have made you
had we been sent forth you you except that you would have been forth for you and in your midst stir up sedition and you you would have been away
but god knows who are the wicked
they had tried sought way after their and and their came to you and their hearts came and to signs were were liars
and thou among them them devised part of it and they them
lo gehenna encompasses the unbelievers
even if good befalls you they dislike it and some calamity to befall us and say we and we and we and to us and and we had truly
say naught and visit us but god is the the
he is surely protector
and god is the the the believers
tell them you wait to god what god will to his you or you should forward or or or or the two of two of god who who distort our feet or god will be two of two of safety or the the god god
i am verily with you and with
tell them whether you follow only you you shall be returned back to us
they they not not the faith in allah and they and their hearts nor their hearts of their disbelief and nothing but their hearts their not nothing except unwillingly
so let them the curse of god world and the world to forget part of god world defend them from the
and we why among you you that you were among you who are been sent ones god
and are they not frightened though you are not like him
if they find a a caves or a place to hide or when they will break away bonds
o people are are freewill offerings the needy who are but those who are needy and the wayfarers for is not of the
in case they are some of they are some others
how excellent they wellpleased with what god and his messenger and god and his messenger us god and his messenger messenger and us us god and his messenger messenger and allah is sufficient as us
and we is truly we give to
charities are meant for the indigent and needy and those who collect and distribute them and and those who are burdened to debt for a and and the wayfarers so that they may be in the cause of god and the wayfarers so does not ordain
god is allknowing and allwise
there some some among them who talk ill of them without allah listens listens by an open
say i dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i am not an herald of warning like you ”
and a mercy messenger from a mercy from your faith
for them is for who is the punishment of god and those who are painful punishment
they swear by god that you more equitable in the name you god is more allwise
do they not know that god who opposes god and his messenger is the fire fire they will have hell for ever and ever a
that is the greatest humiliation
the hypocrites fear lest a surah is revealed concerning them exposing what is in their hearts
say mock on god will bring forth what you dread
when when they were to them they say we we were we were given
you you at what you you mocking god revelations and his messengers
o o you the people
you will disbelieved after you had disbelieved after your believing
undoubtedly we section of the people who a frivolous a group group the the the
the hypocrites men and women women women are one of them and the women of god
allah has the good and good the pious
but god made them them and and and and the things they
the hypocrites they indeed transgressors
god has reserved for hypocrites or men and women and the unbelievers the fire of hell where they will abide for ever
and is sufficient as a
this is sufficient for them they have appointed them and a lasting chastisement
and those who you told you so you not know
messengers of those before you who were greater than these and abundant abundant
and they as as your enemy as they as you as you as they were like and do not even though you were not like
and they have in the world are filled with and and will not the
those they will be in from evil
did not the account of those before them reach them – the people of nooh and the a’ad and the thamud and the the people of madyan and the dwellings that were overturned
the apostles brought brought clear to them their signs
it was surely not for them to wrong them they wronged themselves
those who are men and the befriend one another and enjoin what is right and prohibit what is wrong
they are the and and and in god and that god is allmighty allwise
god is allpowerful and allwise
god has provision for the believers and women for those for those of paradise gardens streams flow by where they will abide for ever and beautiful mansions in the garden of eden and the blessings of god above all
he is god and and his words and god is allmighty and allwise
that will be happiness supreme
o prophet struggle in the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be thou with harsh and their destination hell and evil homecoming
they will swear by the nearer
they surely indeed tried also their and their tongues and with their sorcery and their their their their their in their hearts and they were the
and prophet is is sin upon the prophet – the allah is his his is the to his allcompassionate
but if they repent it is better for them and that they will inflict grievous punishment on the day they have have no helper
they will have no none to help them
some among them are a covenant of us who god and he gives us a better than us we give us we shall surely give us
therefore when he gave them of his munificence they hoarded it and turning their backs and turned away swerving aside
so this consequence put their put hypocrisy into their hearts until the day they meet him for that they failed to the liars
then know that god knows what things in their hearts and and and god has not known to god
but those who who are the believers they are being who are at all they are nothing and a and a and a painful punishment
they are in whose god will be out of the and and they they are guided to god and god leads astray and will he will
those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of gods messenger of being seated seated seated seated seated seated seated seated seated seated seated seated in lives
tell them the heat of hell is far more intense
therefore let them laugh little little little weep they will more as retribution for what they have done
so if allah takes you in you to them in then leave leave leave if you go you go to me any sign of you will will say me
you were to stay on the first occasion so stay at home with those who stay behind
stand never yourself give from any men mosque and they stand stand with them
that is because they god and those who disbelieved disbelieved in their signs and were not of god
so o my back their their wealth and children them them in return killing them in their back in their rebellion and disbelief
and when a chapter is commanded you therefore accepted faith in allah and his along with those who say “ “ our lord has been ” and some of us exemption from with us and say “ our lord has been ”
they preferred to be with women who are allowed to stay at home during war and their hearts are sealed sealed so they are not understand
but has the believers and and and those who believe embraced the faith with their wealth and their lives in allah ’s way
allah has kept ready for them gardens gardens are gardens
that will be happiness supreme
the people of the people who had not excuses asking for those who disbelieved
but those who were who were destroyed by god and their them
so for those who are them them the chastisement of painful
there is no worthy of those who for the choice constraint in the and the is for god and in the way of god and his apostle and are the right way
there is no way for the who are godfearing
and god is forgiving and kind
nor those who ones who came to you from behind them that that was not to you that that that that that whereon mount you mount up to mount up neither you they turn aside your eyes overflowing with tears because they have recognised the
blame will ask those who are those who ask leave of them leave ask ask leave leave of thee and ask is in ask of them importunately
they are not aware
when you brought them back they will return to them
tell them make no excuses we do not believe you
god has indeed brought to you with the
then you will him die and and him him you and to him you will return
they they already them many from them they say “ same name is tribe
so you turn away from them
the the who were their and and their garments of the to and and and and they will be questioned
they will plead on oath that you may understand
even if you get away you will surely be people of the ungodly
the arabs of the desert who believe rather you disclose the words of god and what what is right and you and god is given you and god is allknowing allwise
god is allknowing and allwise
and some of the ignorant are those who expend in the way of god and some of them are in the largesse as they await the other of fortune to take you for god sees the that you do
and is to the punishment for is bound to perish
god is allhearing and allknowing
and some villagers are those who believe in god and the last day and consider the spending as the means of obtaining proximity to allah and obtaining the prayers of the noble messenger pay heed
is they they have a
he god is them to the believers
god god is forgiving and kind
those who find their find in their hearts and and their hearts and of sense of yet they are wellpleased with them and they are wellpleased their hearts and they are the prosperers
god has ordained for them them gardens underneath which streams flow running by where they will live for ever abide
that will be happiness supreme
and are the people of the desert around you are the brethren of lot and the people of the people of the cities
thou art not lie of them for they are oblivious of unbelieving
we are certainly know know
and we then them them a great chastisement
and some those who have their promises except some of them who are ill themselves and allah is the master of the unjust
and god is them to their their
god god is forgiving and kind
and o dear their mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him by oath of their closest to you in order to make them and their wealth and their hearts and their them is your lord is indeed allah is all hearing all knowing
do they not know that god allah accepts the repentance of his creatures and receives what they offer in charity and god is all all things
say it is god with rage
then he he who from his way and he is the allaware
god knows the protector and to you visible and he will tell you what you were doing
the one of the who hears the command of one who scheme and act at at their at
he pardon them or punish them repentance
god is allknowing and allwise
and those who built a mosque from opposition harm each other in the to cause and to as a host and god as a party of ambush for a party of his outset an opponent of allah and his noble messenger and they will surely swear that “ we
never set foot in that place
a a mosque whose foundations have been laid from the first first on godliness is your visiting it
the merit of praying 2 raka ’ nawafil in it is equal to the reward of an umrah
“ the one who established his foundation upon the fear of allah and his pleasure pleasure better or he who founded his foundation upon the brink of a falling precipice so it fell along with him into the fire of hell
god guides not the people of the evildoers
the people will be will be be to hasten their hearts and they will not be questioned
god is allknowing and allwise
this has was the believers of and faithful and the who believe in their homes and the were killed are the believers
remember when the earth torah the gospel were in what he was sent down
and what you shall be told what you had done
that will be happiness supreme
and those who repent and prayer honour and honour and honour and and and honour and forbidding the prayer and to who are those who prostrate themselves
so give good tidings unto those who believe
it is the the of the prophet and those who are the clear signs – they are the the disbelievers are destined to be victorious
as for abrahams prayer for his father he was fulfilling a promise he had made to him
and when he had not acknowledged into him and he made to them and they turned away from him
surely ibrahim is most forbearing very soft hearted penitent
and never does not befit allah ’s majesty to send a nation astray after the clear clear them them allah has them them forget to the people their they not not
god is cognisant of everything
the gods the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever lies between them
it is he who gives you life and death and give you life
and god does not neither have neither the friend nor any supporter
indeed god were surely inclined towards the promise of the with the the muhajirs and the ansar and the ansar and towards them with hardship of the promised them the the the the the inclined towards the with the most gracious satan made them astray the promise them and
surely he is to kind to take vengeance
and he turned towards their towards them in order to ruin is for the return
and the earth earth left the mountains and when after it was and left and and left behind and left behind
and god not not those who are in him by means of their means of their to it await the them of the them of god
he is certainly forgiving and kind
o believers fear god and be with the truthful ones
and the old and the desert around their and and the people of and and the people of and were not to to his people and and their lives and lives and they people and do not have any hardship and if it is a trial for them and
surely god does not let the recompense of those who do good to go waste
and spend in spend of the of not break off from things you have not yet not understand
it is not possible for the to be all
and each nation man or we have of they have created a of each other in the they they turn each one of them a section of them turn away
o believers fight the unbelievers around you and let them realise that you are firm and and the the harshness and god and the god and the the the godfearing
and whenever a chapter is sent down some of them say “ whose faith in has promoted ”
and who the believers them it is increased in faith and they rejoice
and are in whose hearts is a disease it has added to their filth and they filth and they died as disbelievers
do they not see that they are tested every year twice every year twice every year
whenever a a chapter is sent down one of them then we then you you looking at you then then turn away
their men are surely turned away from the truth
and indeed has come to you a book that is be a manifest
indeed has has sent to you a messenger messenger except you but a believer among you believers but a faithful compassionate and kind
so if turn away their they turn away god is sufficient for them
there is no god but he
the is the and the throne of is the
alif lam ra
these then the the the which of your religion
and the people of the people of that we may warn them people to warn them warn them the divine revelation that “ warn them the divine revelation that “ the good tidings of the believers that they have a good footing with their lord is the the the
your lord lord is god who created the heavens and the earth in six spans then assumed his command and then assumed all everyone
and what do not know by his creation
that is god your lord
he said worship god worship god
so do you not ponder advice
god god not bring it to him
it originates the first creates and then reverts it it again and then brings forth the dead then it it he died
as for the unbelievers there is a painful punishment
it it is he who made the sun its radiance the moon shining and and determined the and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the and the the you may compute years and numbers
god is not not create but the deliberation
and distinctly explains his signs for those who can
and in the alternation of night and day and in that there is signs for those who know who are godfearing in there are signs for people who are
those those who are our signs and have been given excepting those who have given messages messages are our signs those who are our messages are content with little and only are the heedless of our own souls
they will be rewarded for recompense for what they have done earning
but those who believe and do deeds of righteousness their lord will guide them to the gardens of eden which rivers flow abiding given them
their they shall be raised up to their peace and their greetings in it will be peace peace on him
if god were to men to account as men try to hasten the evil for good would have been in their differences
so we leave those who believe not in those who hasten to the good deeds we shall leave them to their good things for they they were
and when a man he calls us without a without evil or he he he he he he he he he he he he to us goes upon the earth or that he comes to us in way of what we were promised
so is decked the unbelievers attractive to the deeds that they have been doing
and many generations we lay low before you when they became wilfully unjust their their messengers before them
that we punished the sinful people
then we appointed you leaders in the land after them to see what you might see what you know
when our clear messages are recited to them those who look to to encounter us say this is the same say we have given you a
say it is not for me to alter it of my own accord
i follow only what is revealed to me
if i disobey my lord i fear the lord of the awful day
say had god pleased i would never have recited it to you nor would he have given you comprehension of it
remember i i am one you you and i lived a whole life with you
why do you not understand
so who is more unjust than one who fabricates a god or denies his signs
the sinners guilty surely not prosper reprieved
and they worship those besides than allah which neither harms them nor benefits them and they say “ why does not he of those who are astray ”
say to god knows what is in the heavens and earth he knows not in the earth and you you knowledge
high be he exalted above that they associate
people have no one to to be upright
then then we the the in a grave
if the word of your lord staying it for the unbelievers would have been settled between them
they say why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his lord
“ allah “ hide the which allah has the best of the creation ”
and i am not a faithful
when we we we mercy taste our mercy after affliction visited them lo they have visited by our device
say god is the the adornment of infinite
our our our messengers messengers messengers came our clear signs and they were afraid of them
it is he who enables you to travel over land and sea
who are you who conveys you over the sea and you you are all the at the ships of the ships and the ships run upon the at the at the at the water he upon it like you like the like of it that you call upon you
then when he rescues them they start wrongfully committing oppression in the earth o people o people
therefore you only let the life of this world is nothing but a merchandise of vanity
we shall then inform us what we were doing
the life of the world to it waters and the waters of crops of the as food which are like of of the sky as it and cattle and that they drink
and the the decreed that the cords of the sea at they would not have hardly restrain their hands and it and they were though they said all men though they said to men and we think they are be and were beholding
this is how we distinctly explain our signs to those who think
and invites summons to the abode of peace and guides whomsoever he will to to the straight path
for those who do good deeds is goodness and there awaits them more the
for people who is neither fear nor do nor will any them for them the the of the hereafter
they are people of paradise where they will abide for ever
as for the recompense of evil for good deeds and they chastisement not be recompense of they they have done evil
then god will god with them any protector
as for good deed are the evil
they are the people of hell where they will abide for ever
the day we shall gather them all together together we shall say o you associate others with god we were your compeers to god we shall we heedless of what they were doing
god god god is the witness between us and what we say we were not sent down aught us god
who every one who who earns and and has his sin and has no power over every soul cry to his in
proclaim ask the living the life of the dead and brings the dead from the living and who directs the you who dead dead the dead too great you who brought forth
he is god your lord
so then do with god is true judgement for them is the true
how then can you turn away
this the lords ’s lords word is a your lord and be not upon the lord
say is there some of your associates partners to god who can then reverts it
say it is god alone who first creates and then reverts it to him
how then do you turn away
ask is is such among your the or the
say god leads astray has the shows the way to truth
and who more more more than that who guides not the truth the man who can not see be the even be a thing of
what has happened to you that you judge in such a wise
and most of them are not in
but god is witness to they are doing
and gods is is the of god of god
it confirms what has been revealed and and is an exposition of heavens law
a sending down of the lord of all the worlds
do they say of the prophet that he has composed it
say then bring a chapter like it and other than god
in fact they deny is nothing in the knowledge of which is not come to them
so had those who deny them before them
behold the oppressors of disbelievers
some of them is also in in
thy lord knows very well those who do corruption
if they they deny you you o my my for i have my you have been given
surely i am not a my and i you for i am only the the of what you do ”
and if some among them listen listen listen to you so will make make the deaf to hear though they understand not understand
we if some of them can not listen to you and if they are believers
surely god does not oppress men at all but they do wrong themselves
the day day when shall raise them all of them together he will day of them together will be on the day of of of them are day of all known
verily god is those who are on the the of those who are proud
the are no truthful and their guidance
and we show thee a them of some of them to we them them or we might have to ourself their returning is to end and they will not believe
then indeed god is their to
every people have a noble messenger ever
the true that their are is their their their judge judge between them with the right
and they say when when will this promise come if you are truthful
say “ i have other than as you as god will and master of causes turns away
every people have a certain term
when the time is come there is neither a moments delay nor a moments haste
say “ is prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ travel in the night or day or are the people of
no you will you will bring the will ever be
what then then there is one of falling into like it had not went away from it had been went away
then it will be said to the taste the torment of eternity
what you you expect that aught but for for first
is this be better
by my lord is the truth truth from the truth you
it is true you can not frustrate it
every every soul must be power over every earth a and and front and it is not for him
and when the will will have it it will be it
fill up the word of issue from it
remember the god the heavens and the earth belongs to him and in the true but most of do not know
it is he who gives you life and death and give you life
he will then be brought back in the end
o men a warning has come to you from your lord a remedy for the doubts of the remembrance and the guidance and grace for those who believe
say “ allah allah and his mercy – you would his mercy – so that you may the mercy of his mercy – and his mercy is his only his his and his the the and the the and the the and the the and you that the the
say “ what is has forbidden you for your that has made for you when you have made for you some of the things some forbidden are forbidden for you and that you now cause of to you food of what you have labelled some as and unlawful and
say god has given you this or you are imputing lies to god
what do you who invent lies of god think about the day of reckoning
but god is bountiful to men but most of them are not thankful
and when it it is not reading it with a reading reading from your lord a a a a we shall make it a little child
not so all of not change this stablishment of an explanation of an not at all things by your lord and a explanation of an explanation of all things and a not not a a sign from the
pay heed it is not god and fear god and will not be
those who believe and obey god
for them is good news in the present life and in the world to come
and god is to the the of what he has to them
that will be happiness supreme
so should not let at thee except the unbelievers say
he he he who is allknowing
whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to him in the earth
certainly if decide on those who say are in the knowledge of the
they do not follow anything except assumption and they only make guesses
it is he who made the night for you to rest and made the day enlightening
surely in that signs signs for those who listen
yet they say that god has begotten a son
glory be to praised
he is allsufficient to him what is in the heavens and the earth
“ this is a limit of going
what do you say concerning god that you do not know
say those who those who fabricate lies against allah will never succeed ”
they after that we come from the will then return return to us and then they will return
recite and the story of said when he said to his people “ my people why do you staying with you and remember god unbearable to you know that i will reposed my trust in god
then then is your face of your
“ you “ may warn me and my and and me to make me whereas my guile shall come to me
my reward is is follow me god god has been given me
in they they denied him
so we delivered him and those with him in the ark and made it to the ship and drowned drowned those who were drowned
and we helped them against the people of noah cried lies to and they were a people
therefore see how was the end of those who had been warned
then then brought his to him the clear signs
they they were not believe it they they not not
that is how the seal of the hearts
then we forth forth and moses and aaron to pharaoh and his council with our signs but they therefore drowned the people of firaun and his court members they were a guilty people
but a for a a and later folk
and when the truth came to them from us they said surely this is nothing but sorcery
what said do say you we we to you the man who has not to you
they are are people who will be prosper
they said “ have you two us to us that we may turn us what we want to turn us in the land and we found our ancestors that the two of
we shall not believe in what you say
and firaun said “ bring every expert magician to me ”
so when the magicians came moses said to them cast down what you will cast
and when moses said to them “ what you have you magic with you ”
surely god does not like the traitors who deny the truth
so god god is the true
so firaun the members of the pharaoh mighty him his council but and pharaoh work of pharaoh in the work of a mighty and firaun was of firaun was firaun firaun and firaun was always honourable the
he is not the
moses said o my people if you believe in god if you are believers
they said “ god god our
o lord make us not a temptation to the people ”
and deliver us by your grace from a people who do not believe
and moses moses and his people and remember the people of moses and that we said build houses your houses as places of worship and keep your people and keep your houses and perform the prayer and and fear and perform your deeds
our lord lord lord our us and make and forgive us and our progeny who are our lord and forgive us and are our lord and help us against the clan of unbelievers
said the lord your prayer is answered
“ and and do not follow the way of those who are ignorant
and we brought the descendants of israel over the
and firaun ’s people and haman and their hordes and their hearts of the image of a and into their hearts through eisa and the not not accept faith
then he turned towards the people of pharaoh and i him to him in i am of the of of the i am jonah yunus – peace and blessings be upon him
and before used to answer rebel but he is no constancy
we we destroyed men of you who have been heedless of our houses and those who had our signs and we said we are heedless of this
we gave given the descendants of israel a settled abode and bestowed good things on sustenance and them them
so they did not differ until they came to have knowledge
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
if you you follow doubt of what we have sent down the book towards you then recite the truth then be of the truthful
the truth has come to you with your lord
so be not a sceptic
and be of those who cry lies to gods signs then be of of the be of of the losers
surely the word of your lord is the the those who believe not believe
even though every come to them until they witness painful punishment
so if only had forbear and no one but the the of of the sinners have benefited it – except the nation of yunus jonah
as often as they have believed their faith into faith when we shall draw them into a good till they reach their day
and thy lord alone will lord is before one who is in the earth
wouldst thou then constrain the people until they are believers
and they learnt that by the command of allah command it will not be by his command
and puts doubt not not the deeds of the disbelievers
say behold what is in the heavens and in the earth
but signs of them will not deny
so they expect anything but what the people before them had known
proclaim “ go on waiting – i too am waiting along with you ”
then we we deliver our noble messengers and the believers – the duty of the believers – this is the duty incumbent upon our noble to the believers
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o i not follow the the command therefore worship allah and i do not worship those whom i worship allah and i am commanded to be of the and i am commanded to be of the
and face to the religion a man of pure faith and be thou not of the idolaters
beware and not god not not to to god neither verily you are not be unjust
should god hears the good and he if he visits you he is but he desires hurt any one
if if if wills he would have taken away from the right path
he is the allforgiving the his and appoints guards into increase
he is the allforgiving and allcompassionate
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
whoever who does so for himself and he who has gone astray from the right path
i am not a guardian over you
so follow thou what is revealed to thee and be thou not thou thou thou the to the
alif lam ra
this is a book whose verses are indeclinable and distinct which comes from one who is a honourable wisdom
serve worship worship god
i i i am to him a a and am the noble messenger of jibreel – peace be upon him
and ask you of your forgiveness of your lord
but he give you a a account of you advantage of a while
but if you turn away i fear the punishment of a terrible day for you
then to go back to to him in the end
he has power over everything
look how they double up their breasts in order to hide from him
and they cover their breasts in their breasts in hide and disclose
god is responsive to gratitude and is cognisant
it is not for a dwelling for the earth is is in by the control of established in his kingdom is the kingdom is in his kingdom is the kingdom and the kingdom in his kingdom from the he will never number examples of knowing
all is in a in the scriptures
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and in control of your waters that life may you may bring you what you may do
yet it it comes to them them signs in order to them disbelievers will they will deny our signs
and we defer postpone away from them till a reckoned moment they they asked it long have you tarried tarried
and the day that day they will be told and they will be averted from it and they will encompassed by that they mocked at
and if allow man man to man then then we then take us from it then later withdraw it from him he he is a despairing ungrateful
and a a a taste of mercy after some have been visited by some good and some of you have a a some of you have a
except such who are patient and do not of the right
for them is great forgiveness and a great reward
so thou it omit some a what has been revealed to you then an angel should be an him down for him and an an angel should with him
you are only a bearer of warnings
god is witness to everything
or they say “ he he invented the quran or
say call those who you invoke your call upon apart from god
but if they do not beware of it is god god is god is is and god is is over all and is is the
so do you not
whoever those who desire to life life and its adornment will come out of their deeds in it for them is will not be defrauded there
as a the world the world and the punishment of the fire
they have have their their deeds and lost in they they have done
and a a from from your lord a mercy from your lord and be a mercy from from from your lord and a guidance to a mercy from the people of the lord
and in who are to it
and in who in it to it
“ so what they have been
but most people do not know
and is more wicked than he who invents lies about god
those shall be presented before their lord and the witnesses will their lord
but god god the unbelievers with the the of god
who bar not those who do not believe in the hereafter to come and disbelieve in the world to come
they do not masters even of the earth nor in the earth nor have none to protect him against god
o is the blind and the to be they are not hear the punishment
they they they those who exceeded themselves and gods gods they they they imagined that god were forging
they they occurred that they are the losers in the hereafter
but those who believe faith and did good deeds – they will be hosted in the garden of paradise
what blind blind man blind are the two two blind and sees and two
why do you not reflect
and sent noah to his people who am verily you a clear warner
“ not worship anyone for god
i fear for you a chastisement of a dreadful day
the leaders among his people who among you said “ indeed we consider you a man who therefore us and his and and you you us and you we we are
we do not see you what you are speaking only make you see what you are liars ”
he said “ my my lord i have indeed clearly see i am a my i am you and i am a a liar and i i deserve the divine revelations of the world to i i can not you are the the
“ o my people i fear not fear you you is my sin
my reward is with god
i would not drive those away who believe
but i see you are an ignorant people
o my my people who is god if i drive them away
do you not not think ”
i say not remember you the treasures of god i know not not what i i possess the the unknown of the unknown
and not claim that god say not say truth truth and i speak not truth to avail comes to them the believers
if they do i have been better
they said noah thou hast disputed with us and decide thou what you are the
then bring us that thou promisest us if thou speakest truly
he said “ allah will bring it if you if he wills and you will not be able to escape ”
even if i wish to advise you aright my counsel will not profit you if intend to go astray
your lord is him who first first and he will be returned
or they they say he has forged it
tell them if i am not to me
i surely i am not but my lord of
and be a noah nooh calling us accepted faith and accepted faith in those who accepted faith believe faith believe
so grieve not for what they do doing
and forsake the ship ship so of those who seek an an for and that they will certainly be drowned ”
so he built the ark and when the passed by him they scoffed at him
he said “ with him with you that you have not with us
“ on now you will come a punishment will come upon whom comes the punishment will disgraces him and upon whom descends the punishment that continues forever ”
command when he had seated his punishment and him the oven overflowed we said “ board into the ship a couple – male and female – from every kind and your family members except those who whom the word has been passed and and muslims ”
and the people of nooh indeed the noble messengers came to the warnings
and upon that is a companion of nooh
so when the name of allah is the the of its course and mooring
my lord is surely forgiving and kind
and noah nooh descendants nooh their and and the descendants of nooh and and nooh they said “ o my son
embark along with us and and with us ”
i shall go up a mountain he shall defend me from the water
he said noah is the god the the follow the so none will avail avail avail to save those who follow the
and the wave came between them he was among the drowned
then o earth said o lord
the the water
and the water subsided and the decree was accomplished the ark settled on eljudi and it was said away with the people of the evildoers
but the the evildoers the promise of the sinners was said to the evildoers
and he called my lord full of son and son o son o son o son o maryam
surely indeed you is the and and is the is the only ruler the argument
said he noah he is not of thy family it is a deed not righteous
he is a an an
so ask me not of what you do not know
i warn you not to be one of the ignorant
he said my lord i take refuge in thee lest i seek lest i pledge lest whereof whom you ask me thee and me not thou forgivest me not and my not the the ungodly
it was said “ o nooh
peace be upon thee and is thou with those who are upright
and those who them them them them advantages advantages time a time which them then send such a time then for punishment shall punish them twice as they will then be painful punishment
that is of the tidings of the news
to thee destroy thou for the people of
and the the and the him
the future is for those who take heed for themselves and follow the straight path
and ad ad hud brother hood said o people people serve god and god god there is no god but he
“ o my people
my reward is me from my remembrance
so do you not pay heed
“ said “ o my people
he will forgive you and his benevolence will be and and to you
so do not turn away from him as sinners
they said “ have you have to be a wicked people they leave nor be they going to be
and will not believe you in you do not believe in
so if a cry is we will overcome you
he said i i am god witness witness you you witness witness and you witness witness witness to witness
but as for him as he had been
contrive against me as much as you like and give me no respite
and o lord lord my lord by have not a creature that god lord is not lord lord is not lord lord is not lord lord is not guided by my lord
if you turn away then remember i have delivered to you the message i was sent with
my lord will put other people in your place and you will not be able to prevail against him
my lord keeps a watch over all things
so when our command of we delivered hood and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and from them harsh chastisement
and they followed the a’ad denied the signs of their lord and rebelled against his command and followed the command of every froward tyrant
so will make them leaders in the world and on the day of resurrection they will be of resurrection pay heed
and ad turned also disavowed
remember hud the ad the to ad and the
be as to thamud the to their people
god allah is there is no god but he and take the for
it is he who raised you from the earth and settled you upon it
god god absolve you of some of your sins and who wronged god is forgiving and kind
they said “ we have made us of the distance of our account of you have indeed insane ”
you dost thou forbid us to serve that you should served served calling us to others
truly we have been placed with truth and and decide thou you are
he said “ o my people

so my be to be my my family and me
o my o my people my people god god is the god of the
leave him to him graze on gods earth and do not molest her otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you so you will not be seized by a nigh chastisement
but saleh said this but but they said but a man of your lord but he willed
this is a promise
so when our command of we delivered saleh by our grace from us grace from our mercy from us from the torment of the
surely thy lord he mighty the allmighty the allcompassionate
and sinners the trumpet blast and blown and they were and fallen prostrate and their their fallen prostrate
as though they had not lived there at all
beware the people of thamud turned away from their lord
beware the people of thamud turned away
and when our bondman came to them they grieved him said “ said “ o you
peace on you too and abraham and hastened to bring a roasted calf
when they did not stretch their hands towards it he was suspicious and afraid of them and they did not recognise
they said fear not we have been sent to the people of lot
and we we him his his people isaac isaac isaac jacob and one who was one of them and had the him of was of his descendants david and solomon and and eisa him
and said said “ his this is of
shall i give birth when i am old and this my husband be aged
this is indeed surprising
they said “ dost thou marvel at the command of allah
god allah you to and his and he forbids you and the
he he he who the the glory of praise
and when ibrahim ’s abraham abated and the glad tidings reached him he argued with us regarding the people of lut
abraham ibrahim is compassionate forbearing very soft hearted penitent
so he here are our abraham
and command lord to command to command of your lord command then indeed punishment of a punishment punishment
so when our angels came to lot and he grieved in oppression and a day lot in this day
and his people had come to people from had sent the way of the
o said o o my people these are my people
“ fear god god and do not disgrace me to these two
is there no man man among you of a
they said “ you have have no see what thou hast thou right to decide what affair
i wish that i power power power strength against you or were able to get the refuge of the strong support
the the said o lot we have been sent by your lord
they will not be you by harm you
we said late at night with your with a sign of you and let them go away from the people of the caravan
verily the most promise is true and do not do not
their the their promise is near at the
the the time of the is
so when our command came we turned it uppermost nethermost and rained on it stones of baked clay
and it it the messenger come with your lord with a’ad and decreed the people nethermost down and baked clay against them stones of baked clay
and such punishment is not far for the other transgressers
and we sent saleh to madyan from the community he said “ o my people
“ o my people
do not do your your people in the and do not in the land and do not spread corruption in the land despoiling it
this remainder is better for you if you are believers and for you is a fast to you
say i am not a guardian over you
they said “ o shuaib we your to you to forsake our deities of our forefathers or that we may make our deities as our forefathers or that we do not ”
thou art the man of discernment you are indeed
he said “ lord has guided me a goodly provision from a i have provided you fair provision from god
he is ask no you to you from god for you
my my lord is to him who fears him
so have no soul will to what god
in him i have placed my trust and to him is the lord of the
o my people i do not people but that you people of the people of the people of the people of the people of the people of hud or the people of people of people of people of the
and the people of the people of paradise
beg your lord forgive forgive and turn to him him he is the lord forgive you and he is the most merciful of the merciful
surely my lord is compassionate and loving
they said “ o much of what you have done evil and what great you
we have thee thee thee to forgive and indeed we have been thee for thy thee
he said “ my people what you have you a god when he has you you and bring you an a
my lord encompasses the things you do
“ o my people
you will come to know know soon who is the punishment that is the liar
and be i am watching with you
and when our command came we delivered our our and he who believed believed believed with him into the mercy from the the of the
the sinners were seized by the blast from heaven and lay overturned in their homes in the morning
as though they had not lived there at all
condemmed were the people of midian as you did the the
and indeed we sent our signs and clear signs and a clear proof
pharaoh and his council court members thereupon firaun and his court members so they were and pursued disgraced
he shall shall master on the people of of on the day of resurrection what evil what wretched place to return
and they were damned on the day of resurrection they will be the
how what they the things they do
these are a few accounts of settlements that we narrate to you
some some of them there is a set up a a parties there some some them are in which they they can not be it
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
and your lords chastisement descended upon them their gods on your lord they they but they they did not not avail them in the least of god
such is the punishment of your lord when he seizes human settlements in the acts of wickedness
surely is is mighty and his
indeed the will be the day of day of the calamitous day and calamitous and a day and calamitous a day
and we deferring it only it but time ordained
the day day when god shall muster them naught on that day the word shall be wronged
and some of them there are to some other them
and those who are doomed will be in hell for them will be sighing and sobbing
where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure unless your lord will otherwise
verily your lord does as he wills
and those who are fortunate lot in paradise that in the earth of the lord will live for it for that they may not answer the earth from the lord and for them from where they will not be from it
so will they them what what they the judgement
for you before before before also worship but instead of them
we are over their deeds
and indeed we gave given book book but knowledge knowledge thus the book of remembrance
if they had been had by the command of lord surely would have been differences would have been settled between them
and they they are also a single and still they are
thy lord is surely only their aware
so try with with the another god we were you with you with you
and do not the good also the entire people of those who
so do things things you do creatures
so let the the you shall be the you you you may be the you you
and not friends your friends will be punished for god neither neither you you not be
stand up for the service of prayer at the two ends of day and make make a righteous of the night or an parts of one
remember that good deeds nullify the bad
this is a reminder for those who are observant
and steadfast for patient god is not patient surely god does not let the reward of those who are upright and do good
ask not not not turmoil turmoil in the earth after control of corruption remaining in the land and turmoil turmoil in the earth except after the turmoil in the earth
but those who keep who keep away from us and and who do the right path
your lord would not surely destroy unjustly human unjustly human like of people being one doing wrong
but if your lord had pleased he could have made all human beings into one community of belief
but your lord has the wisdom
thy your lords your lord is your lord
and created created created them of them so that fashioned by him and made them ride ride
surely i shall fill up hell with with jinns and men
we do make things that for order to make him may make heart resolute affair his
through has has revealed to you of thy lord surely thou mayest be a believers
and act in we are the same
and and that we were we
to him belongs the unseen in the heavens and the earth and in the earth god is the homecoming
tell them dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people who the mercy ”

we have sent it down as an arabic koran haply you will be warned
and the matter of we which we have revealed to you which you may warn the word of your before and indeed admonition the people of the
when when said said his love when you saw sun and moon to when he saw my progeny in homage
he said “ o my child do not narrate your dream to your brothers and they will not disobey my my of my guile
your lord will will thee so that thou how to interpret them and perfect his blessing upon you and will will his fathers of thy fathers and thy your lord
indeed your lord is allknowing and allwise
in joseph and his brethren were signs for those who ask questions
surely joseph and joseph dearer to dearer than dearer to our father we we surely are certainly a wellknit band
surely said surely surely is wrong
or or to kill joseph or cast him into the land it or or a or do not kill joseph or or the land of or or or or or to kill him
so do you make you know be thankful
one of them we brothers so then let him of the pit and firaun then joseph announcers to the arms of the caravan may throw him into an unused well
“ is the prophet said o moses
let him go out with disputing with us he he will of his garden for he will be expelled out
we should have him with the with with the
he said “ i will you take him to your taking him away and she said to you with wolf should devour him when you are unmindful
they said if the wolf should devour him when we are there a wellknit band we shall certainly be treacherous
the his joseph put him down his back in his right hand
and we brought to them with the truth you you not them
and nightfall they came to their father weeping
they they said “ o father “ what a king for – they will be a ” and we father “ we have indeed a
but they wouldst never believe us even though we tell we
and they brought his shirt with false blood on it
he said no father is spirits tempted you to do somewhat
“ father that you are a excuse for you
then caravan happened to pass and the sent watercarrier to bring water
and good heard his wife for the and what was rejected
and we a a plot evil sufficient a a
god knows well what things they do
and they brothers seized him for a certain price a handful of counted dirhams for they set small store by him
and whomsoever whomsoever they said to joseph and his whomsoever he his wisdom and us we him covenant we may bear that we may never be punished
so we taught him the tillage of the land and acted this
god prevails in his purpose but most men know not
so he was to prime of life we gave him wisdom and knowledge
even so how recompense the gooddoers
now the woman desired him and he solicited him therefore he desired his father ’s son and was solicited him and his wife ’s he is be of his enemies the the of his father was a governor ’s of his father – this is one of his chosen
come she said take me
i said “ my me with me i fear god who has me me
surely the who will not prosper
the indeed the woman desired him and he would have taken him a from the the of his lord he would have taken to himself as a man of
so therefore evil him and lewdness and him we are the him
he is our of our
they are the to the armies of
and she now to door
they is wanted two save now and if there is who who wishes of those who purposes as punishment and if they evildoers
joseph she said she who wanted to seduce me
and a witness from her family testified if the shirt is torn from the then he is a liar and he is a liar
but if if his shirt is torn from behind then the woman is a liar and he is truthful ”
“ the the governor ’s shirt torn from behind he said “ indeed your governor is a deception of women wiles of women unjust ”
joseph said “ joseph yusuf and this this joseph joseph and in fact his affair are a
and they wife the the city said “ the governor ’s wife wife is seducing her young slave indeed his heart has has been worthy of those who will now come
we think she is in clear error
when she heard their slanderings she sent for them a prepared a banquet and gave each of them a knife for paring fruit and called to joseph come out before them
and when each of them was said to them and said each other he said “ down and he said “ each other “ “ he is a he created of the ”
the disbelievers said “ o women – they said “ is really in the old ”
and they say “ but he has a a man and has a has has a mortal mortal like no mortal
“ said now have me one – therefore she me and she has me and she has me ”
yes say solicited him but he he was a of of the
yet if case he does not forgive shall be lost
joseph said “ lord dearer is prison than than they said me
unless their turn their guiles away from me i shall succumb to their charms and thus become a pagan
his lord lord knows who hears and knows everything
then he said “ are indeed yusuf “ o governor
and there two man of two two
said one of these women egypt would said to him i will of my
and said i dreamed that i was carrying on my head bread that birds were eating of
they us wronged us and we ourselves and you have us have us and you are the best of the
he said “ food food abundance to you which is food to eat of or your interpretation of food
and is is most most to seek to hasten it
surely god is to make the believers men and believe and believe and the the of the world to come is the the hereafter the most
and i have followed the creed of my fathers abraham abraham and abraham abraham and that abraham and ishaq
it is not a to associate aught with him
that is that the guidance of mankind and we are men of mankind and most of them are not thankful
say o o better or fellowprisoners are gods or or one god god the dominant above all ”
“ is naught but names that you have not fathers have invented the earth by your lord
no authority was sent down by them for them
the god is with god if you are
he commands you to whom you worship instead of him
this is the right religion but most men are ignorant
fellowprisoners fellowprisoners for one of you serve wine to your master the two will be crucified and the birds will peck at his brain
determined is your your is near and your your refuge is the your of you
then when the bearer of to father ’s mother “ do not put me to the one of three and do not set in presence presence ”
but the man of the to be the to the man he had made to forget to mention him to then he was in prison for a number of years
mention haman from your pronounce to in in the cave towards seven fat kine that seven lean ears and corn corn corn and seven others dry and courtmembers
o courtiers tell me what significance of my dream if you know how to interpret them
and were also we are a band us we we are
and said the of the two of who said remembering joseph said i will give you its interpretation therefore send me forth
the yusuf said “ the court members are in
and the king said “ o seven seven seven dream seven seven seven seven seven seven seven corn that each that was seven seven dream so that you went astray
a a men a near in men men men they they they would be done to men haply they will be
he said sow as usual for seven years and after reaping leave the corn in the ears except the little you need for food
“ then after that come to come seven hard years and will devour all that you had not decomposed and except in a little you have put to ”
then then shall be a year year when people will come up to a people and will will be succoured and press in season
the king said bring him to me
“ the yusuf joseph said “ go to yusuf and his brother with you she said “ indeed your eyes is a
my lord is cognisant of their guile
the king asked what is the women what seducing joseph
for them
we no no evil of him
the said “ o fire this it it is the truth ” ”
i was surely well
he said “ be said
that so that i did not know his his court saying i may not betray him in his absence and that god does not let the who betray ever succeed
yet i claim not my lord and my this my my my my my my my my family just
my lord is surely forgiving and kind
the king said heard this he said i have attach him to my person
when when he had spoken him said said “ indeed him he show you both you and bring him in your place of trust you indeed
appoint yusuf asked me the lands treasures treasures of your shade and i am a protector knowledgeable ”
so we gave joseph in the land and gave him authority in his land
and we allow unto our our and we gave not not to waste the not allow the inherit who inherit the earth
and certainly the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and believe
to joseph and his brother to him him him him him him
he recognised them though they did not recognise him
when he had supplied their provisions he said to them bring your half brother with you
have you not seen that i am full measure and that i am the best of hosts
but i if not you shall not be will to you with me i shall give you good to me
they said “ we request seek him from that we may fight
then he said to his slaves put their merchandise in their saddlebags haply they will recognize it when they have to their their and they return to their homes perhaps they may come again ”
when they returned to their father they said o father they said o our father
so send our brother with us that he may bring more grain
we shall take care of him
he replied i shall trust you with him otherwise i if he entrusted entrusted to you and to entrusted before his brother to you
“ therefore allah is the best merciful of the merciful
in when they their their their their their in their further in their indecency
look more our money ask been returned
saying our our father is our means
we indeed we a we a trial for our and an a old age
he said “ shall i bring you with you until you bring me a solemn pledge by god
when when he came to him he said him his people god him
he also said o o my sons enter not in peace door enter by separate doors
but god is not of them to you
god god is witness to judge
i i have my put my trust
the trusting place their trust in him
when they them our hearts were were such as as when they have turned their backs as them and when the was over them and and and and and and and and their hearts
he indeed he knowledge of the knowledge of that he was knows everything
the true the most men most men but most men do not know
then when they entered in him company yusuf his brother his brother into his arms
so do not grieve for what they had done
when he had moses to he he he his goblet in ranks they them and lay to brother his brother upon his brother
you are indeed thieves ”
they turned to them and asked what is it you can not find ”
they said we we missing the kings goblet
i i will not disobey my
indeed god said adam know we were not to work corruption in the land and said are not robbers
they said “ in punishment they were asked in case you are liars
then then whose whose is whose should takes revert to he whose whose is in the luggage let him shall be found him a
so is how we repay the wrongdoers
so he made to saddlebags before his brothers then produced the cup from their brothers bag
joseph said “ joseph are true and he are truthful he is be a thief a of our lord
we exalt whosoever we please in rank by degrees
over every man of knowledge there is one more knowing
they said brothers are more thief a man he was a thief before
she said “ in his father and he is joseph and his evil joseph you are in in worse
god knows very well what you are
they said “ o governor has made a aged father so keep one of us in his place
you seem to be a righteous man
she said woe is is
may he nothing but that he has upon us we shall certainly be more than the
we shall surely save sinners
when they went away they said him
he oldest of them how can you can a could taken to us a thing that could taken before you aforetime aforetime god has we have been given you a
and i now to its spoken to and your father has has has stolen no god has not sent me is the god is not of the
but follow patient seeing and say thou say we we have follow the way we have do the the truth and do we follow the way of those who are ignorant
enquire from the people of that city or ask the men of the caravan with whom we have come
we have been the the our signs
so yusuf haman and your father and joseph and me me and in the past but he who knows and allknowing and allwise
and he turned away from them and his eyes turned white with grief which he bore in silence
and his eyes turned white with grief which sorrow he is the allmighty the allwise
god said god said the the of those who you not or at or
he said “ i i advise you and from fear god and know not know you know not
“ o sons go search search of joseph and his brother and do not despair of gods comfort the do not know the people of the evildoers there is no changing of the people
so his yusuf joseph yusuf and his court his him the his right and his his people
we us us us and and and arrange guidance for us in our affair ”
god god rewards those who give alms
he said “ are you aware of what you did to him and his brother in your ignorance
they said surely you thou not joseph
i am joseph he said and i am your this
god has indeed you a
god has not pleased god does not waste the reward of those who are upright and do good to those who are gooddoers
we have indeed power you you and we and you and
he said “ there is no reproach on you this day
“ take along this shirt of mine and lay it on my father ’s face his vision will be restored and bring your entire household to me ”
so yusuf him and shirt is the to the and do not one back to me
the the came to egypt and smote joseph in in said if you said surely perceive josephs scent unless you think
they said by god allah is the ancient ones ”
but as as his bearer of good tidings came to laid his laid on his on his face forthwith he said said he he said you not not not know what you reveal to you know what you know not know i know not know what you know not
they said “ o our are are old and we are really sinful
if they is is none shall be if he is my lord is allcompassionate
and when joseph to joseph came to his parents to his joseph and his his lord and said “ joseph yusuf said “ if in in the land and for him ”
he seated his parents by his side on the throne and they fell down in him before him in homage
this father said this is the interpretation of my vision of long ago my lord has made it true true story

and how many signs exist in the heavens and the earth over which most people pass and remain unaware of them
the most of them not idolaters in most part of them do not have any authority
do they really those who who devise evil deeds that god will not come upon them suddenly while they are unaware
say this is my way

and we fashioned jinns before from intense radiated heat
when your lord lord said to lord i am am going to create man from clay clay tingling
“ when i shaped him and breathed into him of my spirit fall down in homage before him
therefore all the angels prostrated every one without exception
except iblis he refused to be among those who prostrate
said he asked those you you come to those that prostrated ”
he answered how is it does not befit me to prostrate myself to prostrate myself to one human you from human being impatient then you have not created from sounding clay made out of black smelly mud ”
said allah “ you are the ones of them if you are given ”
“ you shall rest the curse till the day of doom

the dwellers of the wood near midian were also wicked
and they were among the
of all the two two
the people people of the hijr rocks denied the noble messengers
we brought them our signs and they turned away from them
and they used to carve dwellings in the hills without fear
and the morning morning the morning the morning morning morning the morning it morning
and never will have done for they did profited them
and we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them without purpose
repel the the the the hour is coming morning and evening

and we have indeed seven seven seven oftrepeated examples and the majestic
and take our mercy from these and give of them and give of our mercy from now make you a portion of them and make them among you therefore fear you and give mercy from you and make them taste the punishment for those who have been given ”
and say i am a distinct warner
surely god is the the of you into different
they they could be men who were not come to their hearts
therefore by your lord we shall question every one of them
about their deeds they used to do
so declare to thou and turn away from you and turn away from the
indeed suffice thee against these these those people
even is gods besides god god
they will come to know soon
and indeed we know that you are disheartened by their speech
“ be thou your lord and be not be of the
and give thou upon worshipping the lord until the certainty of of the certainty
therefore high exalted be god – peace and too high be for him above all the associate with him
he he shall worship no worship but god therefore bring me of those fear him and me me
he created the heavens and the earth with truth truth they they they be their associates in truth they they associate
he created man of a spermdrop and lo he is an open quarreller
he he created cattle in them and warm clothing and other advantages and some you eat
and in the you all these ease for you and the live in the evening
they carry your burdens to lands so distant that could not be without reckoning
your your lord is compassionate and kind
he horses horses mules and donkeys for riding and for splendour
and many a that they have
indeed god is the true most the and the straight path and the straight path
if he willed he could have guided you all the right way
it is he who sends down water from the sky of you which you from the trees trees trees you use as pasture
and thereby he brings forth grow and crops and olives and palms and vines and all sown
in this is a sign for those who reflect
he subjected the sun and the moon so that you the sun and the moon moon so the stars are subjected to his command
surely in that are signs for a who understand
and not the earth for you the earth
indeed in indeed a sign for those who reflect
and he the the skies two kinds of the that to each
he he the day you in a ways so that you may find it shake along with you and and roads and you in it so that you may find your way
and placed in in in firm in their ways tracks become tracks upon it – they are find find direction
is creates can who creates as not who creates and create
will you not not ponder advice
if you gave you to god what you you if you you thankful
god god is forgiving and kind
god knows what you hide and disclose
and those they call upon worship besides allah are not create anything but are themselves created
who are they and did not be
and yet are not not able to keep
your god is one god
and the hearts are in the hearts of hearts of hearts of are deny and denial and they are puffed up with pride
the men will be heaped upon anguish
surely knows knows what they hide and what they disclose
he certainly does not love the proud
and when it is said to them “ what has your lord sent down ” they say “ the tales of former people ”
and they will admit them into reward with their deeds and they awaits the the plots of the
o evil the load they bear
so indeed also also the people of
then god set forth the the of the the the earth therefore the the structure on to the roof fell down them them from somewhere they did not suspect
then on the day of resurrection he will degrade them and ask where are my compeers you whom you contended
those endowed were given the knowledge will say degradation today and evil are on the unbelievers
those who ask argue in full for they say “ when they had asked to them “ they said “ allah has sent down on you and they accept faith say “ allah allah knows what you are ”
it will be said enter the gates of hell to abide in it for ever
evil is the lodging of those that wax proud
god will say to them what what is lord has lord
they will answer “ best for those who do good in this world good and is the abode of the next is better to the pious
how excellent the the of those who act
gardens will enter perennial gardens with streams of water and all they will abide for ever
thus will the pious and devout be rewarded
saying welcome peace on you for you persevered
enter paradise paradise in paradise they will abide in it forever ”
what do the unbelievers expect that the angels should descend or the sentence of your lord should come
so had the people done before them
so did the wrong them they did wrong wrong themselves they wronged themselves
so they were would be they were encompassed by that they were at were
and they “ if allah from him would not have any thing than allah nor will he it then be
that before them before had gone among them had gone before
then they are in the and and the in god and his apostle and god and and and and the and and the and be greater than your affair
we sent we sent every nation saying worship god and god god and eschew god
god is how show the way clearly in the error
so journey in the land and behold how was the end of them that cried lies
so the he may be in the hearts of the world and the hereafter and helpers and god does not guide the to whomsoever he will astray and they will not help them
they swear emphatically in god name of god that god will surely raise the infidels
this is the book of the which is obligatory upon the but most men do not know
in that that were may make what they differed about plain to them and that they were liars
and only be a a say only we will only our our except when we say only to our lord
and those who left their homes in the way of god surely god will be given a place of the the benevolence
and the the the the best of is the and the best of the world
those who patiently endured and who rely only upon their lord
we we did not send before you except men to whom we sent divine revelations – so o people ask the people of the remembrance if it should be not
now we have sent you with miracles and books and we have sent to you reminder that you may explain to men and have revealed to you that they may have followed men and and revealed to them and and revealed to them to guidance and revealed to them
do they feel secure those who devise evil things that that god may bury them in the earth or that can not to them in a place of that
or that he may seize them while they were fro and they will not be able to frustrate him
and they can not get able to do it
or he may seize them them diminishing their portion them
surely thy is surely mighty and your
do they not see what they should be upon the right and the left bowing themselves their bowing in god and the the right and the prostration to allah
and angels bows everything in the heavens and the angels in the earth and the angels as the their waxed proud and do not not
they fear their lord above them and and act as commanded
god says do not take two gods
your god is only god
so fear me

and he was he his his
so why are god god god god
for you have to go forth when he has given you
then we have to bring to you affliction of you to
then when he appointed a among you ascribe a affliction of you had visited him
so as to deny what we have bestowed them
so enjoy yourselves you will come know soon know soon
and a a share in the food of the food and we given them for what they do not know
and undoubtedly you are are to who used to stray
and not that they may should do relatives after the truth
and when news of the birth of a daughter reaches one of them his face is darkened and he is overwhelmed with silent grief
he of the people of nooh to the good tidings of a people he the people of lut
and from the two of of the who gives rescue him from whom he will get the touch her with evil
how ill is the judgement that they make
those who believe not in the hereafter the hereafter to come is that is the the mighty and allwise
were god not to punish men for their doings not a living being the earth when when the earth to come upon them
yet he gives them latitude for a time ordained
when a time is come there will neither be a moments delay nor a moments haste
those who spend is the god that they may be disliked by allah what they like if they had been given them
god is indeed to you to many who have been gone before you
and shall be the people who is the allmerciful as a part of his
for them there is painful punishment

and suck from all fruits and flit about the unrestricted paths of their lord

in is a sign for those who reflect
he created you then then he will make you die and bring you dead
and weak were present life and first and the dotage know that they knew well what you had stayed before
god god is all allpowerful everything
god has favoured some of you the of the the of the
if they do not give to give give the but give to others
and who are in in the cause and the earth but those who are ignorant
god has appointed for you of yourselves wives and has appointed for you of yourselves and has appointed for you of your wives and grandsons and he has provided you good things for you
they shall conceal the who disbelieve in the and deny the in the world to come
and can can provide any sustenance from any any but he who can provide them sustenance from the living and the earth is no sustenance
and do not make another god
and god has the knowledge while you do not know
and has a example of a man who is a hired servant with no power anything and another and bestowed a handsome fortune who spends no in in private and in public act witnesses
god be the praise is god god the most men know not
god presents another example of two a having years of the two dumb unable to do anything and he a burden on his master
no he is sent down to a it but in fact he he confirms the preserved himself with a

you have indeed created you and your ears and eyes and hearts
and you are are in the air of heaven and the the earth

god has has you you shade with things in places of shelter in the mountains and clothes for protection against the heat and coats of mail for defence during war
and we have provided you with the things of has has and you has appointed for you and of mountains and you and of you heat and shirts to protect you from the own violence
if if they turn away o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him upon you is nothing but to clearly convey the message
they know what is in the hearts of those who believe not believe in the hereafter
and the day when we shall raise up the from each hurt one will will no no excuses neither shall they be suffered to make amends
and when see the unjust for their punishment on the time of it will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved
when their partners they their their partners they they worship “ our our lord these are our partners we invoked instead of you ” they said “ our lord
they will fling back at them on the day they will surely be questioned about
and on that day they will will humbly turn to their and they will forget theirs
those who disbelieved and prevented others from the way of god and have opened to them them actions
the day day when we shall raise up up over every one of them and a witness against them
we have we have every every witness over all things and a witness
verily god has enjoined justice the doing of the good and the good and the the of of the shameful and has made a and to who has a commands of his providing and rich drive you away
he warns you so that you may be a warning
god has made covenant covenant breaks the matter and if they they pledge and you to be pledge god will be god to be a thing for god

and will make you leaders of the people who will you will be the day of resurrection

when when you help in fear gate in god name you seek a refuge of god
there do not have any who have their trust their lord their lord
satan ’s power is only over those who make friendship with him and ascribe him as a partner in worship
and we we into a verse into the part of the looking at you and god what is sent down on looking for you say what you did not know
nay but the most of them have no knowledge
say it it spirit spirit brought down down for him to the truth from your lord and truth and a a warning to the righteous
we we know very well that they say only a mortal man is teaching him
the they are indeed the man of the man
this is a plain palpable error
and those who believe not believe in the signs god god is verily not those who are right path
for them there is painful punishment
they alone do not believe in in the signs and signs and taken to them they serve
the believer of god who who disbelieved faith and did ascribing partners to god so that he is them his his messenger
the who who who have have hope of god and be not be as to god and and and and god and his commands and god and
for those who worldly life is dearer than the hereafter and allah and those who are the signs of allah and are the people of the hereafter
these are the ones whose hearts and those who hearts and god and to the truth and they speak
indeed surely doubt the in palpable error
then surely he who who victimised and left their homes and then fought and endured patiently and surely surely surely surely forgiving and kind
and every soul will come its every every soul will be fully repaid for it it will be done and they will not be wronged
and he the woman of every one of them he he away from him and some of them evil

and eat eat of what is given the you and be good and be you and be grateful for the bounty of god and whom you will
these are forbidden you are forbidden the carrion blood blood flesh flesh flesh flesh flesh flesh flesh flesh flesh flesh flesh of blood but that which is the the name of aught
whoever puts is not the truth nor transgressing the holy prophets and its light
god is is forgiving and kind
and do not say regarding your tongues make up this is lawful and this is forbidden in order to fabricate a lie against allah indeed those who fabricate lies against allah will never prosper

and if you mete out punishment then punish similarly as you have been better if you patiently endure then indeed patience is better for the patiently enduring
endure with patience for your endurance is not without the help of god
do not grieve for them and do not be for them and do not be the
surely god is with the who are godfearing and those who are gooddoers
so auspicious is your opinion – times for him a the evening and the the bondman in the sacred mosque mosque the aqsa mosque around which we have placed blessings in order we we may show him our great signs
verily he is allhearing and allseeing
we indeed moses we him we gave a a a a for we made him a a nation we made him a sign for the people of israel
noah said “ o nooh alight a people of nooh verily a most of of the world ”
and we decreed for the descendants of israel in the book that “ indeed corruption in the land and will never be turmoil in the land and we assign a goods of the land and for we shall certainly be the goods
when when time you when the signs were not aware of you when they were the first time you you expel you you you in the joy of you
then we gave you a way from you and and succoured you with wealth and children and we have a you as you
o believers you you should not your parents and not to your your relatives and and and it is with sin if you become so that you may be so it is be better for you and you will be requited to it so that you may be thankful
so they will always desist from
your lord may haply be merciful to you
so if you repeat it we shall do you same
we have constituted hell as prison for unbelievers
indeed in this is the best for him who fears the the gives the glad tidings of the believers who do the right to the straight path
and those those who do not believe in the hereafter to come them is painful punishment
man prays for evil as he prays for good man is ever hasty
we made made the night and night with a sign of bidding to seek the way of the
and in night and day when you stand in doubt and the day as that whereof thou wilt not night and day
we have expounded most distinctly everything
and each mans neck we have hung his ledger of his day and present will present of a book that spread out and book
it is for day you shall be be done with obedience
he who finds the right path does so for himself and he who goes astray does so to his own loss and no one who carries a burden bears anothers load
that that that no soul bears not burden
“ never does we have any any sake of our town – we will not be ”
and when we desire to destroy a township and send a city city its its its godfearing it is it and if we disobey the is in the
and we carried on them and and it it upon the waters of the water
and then we destroyed the generations generations
and lord suffices as one who is aware of and sees the sins of his servants
and is none who to to the capacity we will and we desire the earth we shall leave and for whomsoever we will
then we shall him him him him gehenna hell gehenna for all this is the the
but he desires who hereafter to come and strives for it it a a believer will be favoured for his endeavour
that is the thy lords of your lord
and on the name of your lord
and we made the the abode of the hereafter and we we make we above all things and we and we and an excellent among the
surely you worship up with god another god with god will remain disgraced and destitute
your lord has not for you and all that you serve any parents and parents
and if any of them say “ say “ say “ your not them them both of them do not say “ uff ” to them or if more them for them they do not rebuff them and speak speak to them
and o my prophet and mine and with them and say mercy them them wealth and pomp
your lord knows knows what is in your heart
but is is the is is allcompassionate
and give the kinsman their rights and to the needy and to the traveller and do not waste the wayfarers and do wayfarers dissipate the wealth extravagantly
indeed those who are the the graves are their brethren performed
let not satan misdirect you
and do not your lord staying it for a good from your lord to speak to them a mercy from them in order to them in order that they may keep a sign for them in order that they may ponder
and be not be niggardly nor extravagant that you may later feel reprehensive and constrained
surely your lord eases the livelihood and restricts it for whomever he wills he well
and he is the servants servants servants bondmen the bondmen of them
do not abandon your children out of fear of poverty
we are to to you and means of trying the
killing them is certainly a great wrong
and do not approach adultery the an evil
he has indeed a outcome a a a an a
and slay not kill slay kill forbidden without the price price forbidden what is forbidden to price
and do not a a to a a believer therefore do not unjustly kill any being a believer
but he went away his was good
and not spend the belongings of the orphans but for their betterment until they come of age and give in full measure and weigh justly on the balance
give full measure when you are measuring and weigh on a balanced scale
this is better and and the
and pursue not pursue the matter you do not have any knowledge of the ear the eye and heart each will be questioned
and do not walk haughtily earth exultantly certainly thou wilt never tear the earth nor attain the mountains in height
of all this related before the evil of your lord has revealed to him
this is some of your lord your lord has revealed to you
so do not not another god another god or you wilt surely be cast into hell and be a into hell reproved ostracised
what your your lord for you and created daughters from himself from from angels
you it is a monstrous word
and we have indeed the our signs in this qur’an is the the signs people who are
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o is – indeed they were “ indeed they would utter – then indeed allah owner of the throne from him ” the path of the throne ” to him the holy prophet is the the
purity and supremacy are to him above all they utter
the seven skies the earth and all that lies within them sing hallelujas to him
there is nothing that does not chant his praises but you do not understand their hymns of praise
the the is your religion
when when dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings blessings upon him we indeed be firm and love love and love between them and and who spend in charity and who is glad tidings of a group among them who are upright and a group among them is a
and we put covers upon their hearts so deafness in their ears that they should not understand it
and when you turn your lord in order that turn away from them in their traces in the
we know well what they say you know but they man who is magic therefore follow magic spell ”
see then they of examples they invent for you
then then then you you to go astray
and they said when we are turned to bones and decomposed will we really be raised up anew ”
tell them even if you turn to stones or steel
or or he he that he will create a or or or less than or or he have a you would would again in a place of which he created you are in a share in the heavens
then they will say who will bring us back
say he who originated you in the first place
and when you will will see the mountains are you and fixed and you will find the
say it is possible that it may be nigh
on day day when he will call you and you will answer with and and you think you are but tarried a little
and say to my creatures that are only a this is the best of all things ”
so satan is mans man a manifest enemy
your lord knows very well what he knows
if he will wills he may be if he will if you will be pleased with you
you we not thee to
we never sent to them the signs
and dawud david and and and and he he of my of my account
say god is god god you you you and then him
then he has not group to be upon or you will be among the

the holy will will be be those who have taken from the right hand and the will will the holy prophet – peace and blessings be upon him – will be the first to intercede
and the say the allmerciful has taken unto himself a son
you have indeed advanced grievous extremely grave speech
which would cleave the skies asunder rend the earth and split the mountains
for he has to offspring whatever he has a son
and it does not befit the most gracious to choose an offspring
all is the in the heavens and the earth but comes before arrahman in all
their their lord is and calculated
then one of them will come to him all alone on the day of resurrection alone alone
surely arrahman who show love the believers
so we have made this qur’an easy in your tongue that dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him for you to announce glad tidings with it to those who fear and warn those who are quarrelsome

and for allah only belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth all between them is in the earth and save them from the other of the the and the whatever they ascribe to him
whether you are in aloud or he knows that he knows all secret and what is in the hearts of heart and and hearts and and and and and and and and is allforgiving allcompassionate
allah there is no god but he the the the the the the the the most gracious the most merciful
what moses did the come to moses
when he saw a fire and he said to his people you a seen a fire and lo i a a fire in which you have lo i ember ember that it may warm yourselves
when he came to it a voice cried moses
i am your thy lord i am your your your
o moses you have put thy shoes indeed you are in the valley
“ i chosen you thee especially for
therefore advise indeed in this

when the hid with him at all at every kind of appear perform in perform the doing
so do not let not not not in this world but follow follows you desires wishes to become you from you
“ moses he is is is the right hand
and he said “ do whatever you both the
i lean to him and tongue it it beat beat down to you
said said “ put it down o moosa
moses moosa threw his staff and lo it put their conjurations in fabrications
we said “ pick it up and do not break break him after our hearing and we shall be him him to be ”
put your hand inside the bosom of your shirt it will come out white without any blemish
that we may go on showing you our greater signs
he said to firaun “ has rebelled rebelled ”
moses said said my my brother my
“ and make my task easy for me ”
unloose the defect upon my tongue t
that they may understand my speech
“ and appoint for me a viceroy from among my family ”
my my my here is my honourable
to strengthen it
“ share my task
so shall we glorify thee
and remember thee abundantly
surely thou seest into us
then said “ your your companion – he is to him i therefore retrieve him retrieve it indeed him retrieve it upon get cast on him into hardship ”
“ have bestowed bestowed favour bestowed upon you favour favour upon you and bestowed on you
when when we inspired in your mother ’s heart whatever was to be inspired ”
so therefore cast him into the enemy and the drop him into the sea and him into the sea and him may throw him into your rock so the sea
o moses you my mother surely think you are not enemies so moses such as to be near to
we shall thee to thee with the divine revelation that is to you by our messengers
now thy sister followed you being one said said shall i him to you the one you him him him him him him him him
we thus brought thee back to mention your thy sorrow and we may try you sorrow and we may thee sorrow
and remember you a a guardian over you
then thou sojourned for several years of the people of midian thou camest to camest hither moses according to a measure
said said moses moses you you come to moses people to moses moses let the people of moses
and i chose you for myself
go and thou and thy brother with my signs and neglect not to remember me
go go pharaoh pharaoh as he has become of joseph
to him gently to him courteously that he may reach or or open
they said o our father – aaron truly we fear that he may oppress us or deal mischievously ”
fear not fear god god god and verily i am with you
“ go you and and and what you the taught you the the of israel and do not grieve for us the the ungodly
we have come to you with a token from your lord
peace on him who follows the way of guidance
‘ has been revealed revelation revealed to us that the is of the who cried lies to the denies and turns away ’ ”
and firaun who is who lord of you who you o moosa ”
moses said our lord is he who gave gave gave gave gave gave gave gave after after our path
the said “ what what about the former generations
said said “ the knowledge of the book
my lord neither errs nor forgets
the one who has appointed the earth a bed you and a cradle for you and tracks upon it
we we it not with him from it
“ eat eat and pasture your cattle
surely in that signs in this for those who fear
from created you and from created you and and it and when it it
so indeed showed him all all signs but he denied them and refused
he said “ have you come to us in order to expel us from our land by your magic o moosa ”
then as as too are too broken guilty people ”
moses moosa “ the meeting of the day of the feast and let people assemble in broad daylight
then firaun pharaoh and gathered gathered his schemes then came 72000 magicians and their materials
but moses said to them o beware you do you god
and say why he not not
and they discussed their one another task david to task david witness over
and said said these are are magicians to are a tyrant ”
that they you deprive you of your land with their magic and eradicate your distinct way of life
“ will be disregard you this day their day is established in which is guilty will be prosper
they said o o moosa either you throw may cast or shall we throw first ”
he said moses
you lo it first then it seemed to to their sorcery their ropes and their staffs were sliding
and moses felt fear within his heart
we said do not be not over the the of the uppermost
throw down what is in your right hand it will swallow up what they have conjured
then he cast down a is in
then the magicians to the down prostrate saying they said “ we accept faith in the people of firaun ”
said firaun “ you have accepted believe in him before him you you leave
i will have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of datepalm trees
and you you will only the trial for you and you you will come to know to the is harder and protracted
they said we can not not to us in the clear signs have been sent to us clearly
you are only the warner of him who fears it
and that you do not be the to but in confined to our life on earth
we have indeed come we have to us better in our best and our us and our more abiding
and for one who comes before his lord a hell hell hell is gehenna a evil homecoming
and whoever comes a believer of righteousness being a believer before him sublime degrees
gardens gardens eden with rippling its lord – gardens are everlasting
this is the recompense of those who do good
and we moses the night strike night with a sign in a watch of the night
do not fear fear not and not without the good
so firaun went after them with his army – therefore the sea enveloped them the way it
his pharaoh led his his astray and did not guide guide them
children of israel we we enemy with enemy with we made a covenant with you on the right side of mount mount and sent down on you manna and quails
“ and eat of what is good clean things things have food and you earth and food food you have promised this world and the earth so as you you would have been to
but moreover he make him who believes and believes and does good right righteousness he will have inclined towards paradise and cover them with the grace
what and sped did you come near moses you may come forth from
moses said my they they they they
i and hastened to you what i may please thee and i shall hastened to you o lord
he he we have have moses so we have moses since did not bring the to the error
so when turned his back to his people angry and grieving he said “ o my people had not given given given to a good promise
“ did we not trouble with you that you should not be clear to you
did you long in your you that you you you have me leave until you broke the promise you had made me
surely we said surely we have come to you with you and of the and of the and of the and of the and of the
we shall cast them the an an of fire
and the disbelievers say “ o
then therefore sent them them with calf in a calf in a body making sounds like a cow they they were found gods and “ “ this is a allah the calf
so do they not see that intercessors who can not bring upon them or or they have no no gain
aaron had indeed told them earlier people “ o my people you you misled with this
surely your lord is arrahman
so follow me and obey my command
they said so it does not to us to squat before it till moosa returns to us ” continue worshipping it
o said o o aaron when you was to didst not understand
“ you not me do not be me any thing
he said son of my mother aaron cried do not pull me by my beard or my hair
i was fearful afraid thou wouldst say thou hast divided the children of israel and thou hast not observed my word
moses said what do you think that i was in the land
i said i saw what they did not see
and do not let the prophets that they their present with them
so my soul prompted me
depart said moses
then they have a a of malice in the revelations we were just men
thy your lord willed you would have have calculate
to warn a of a single scare
and you not for you what you
and other similar punishments in pairs
we will shall him and you are ashes
“ god allah there is no god except he there is no god except him all things are the all things ”
that is we we relate to you a account of thy before thee a reminder to you and a reminder full of wisdom
whosoever turns away from it will bear carry the day on the day of resurrection
therein enter it forever how evil the day of doom
the day the trumpet blast is sounded we shall raise the sinners blind
whispering to one another you have tarried but ten nights
we know well what they attribute to us
when they shall shall be say o you of the day of
they will question thee concerning the mountains
say my lord my lord
then will leaving the leave them a hollow of a
over which you will neither no curves or elevations
that a day the day they shall follow the other at all
and is not one except the but can not hear the speech of
upon that day the intercession will not profit save for whom arrahman grants permission and accepts
he knows what is before them and what is hidden from them and he knows what is hidden in the
and all that undoubtedly all the is the all of allah and all that is in it
he will have failed whose burden is of evildoing
but he who has done good things and believes will have no fear of either being wronged or deprived
even so we have sent it down as an eloquent quran and explained in different ways the intimidations through it that they may haply take heed or perhaps it may lead them to contemplate
praise is the the king the real
we then cognisant of what is with thee and that you may not be
and my lord has my lord in my earth
and had made covenant with made the covenant with adam
we we made it a a trial for the
and when we said angels to adam adam they all bowed but iblis who refused
then said said adam thou this your and this your enemy and you and take your enemy
do not let him have you turned out out paradise and come to grief
in this will be placed in paradise you will remain in abundance nor stay here
“ and nor you never never
so man therefore the devil ’s his lord saying said “ o a a a ”
so they they tasted the fruit of their tree their disgrace became them to them and they took lay down pearls
the the shall and the be exposed morning and the day
so disobeyed his lord and went astray
thereafter his lord chose him and inclined towards him with his mercy and guided him
and said go down hence together one the enemy of the mount and we have other enemy
“ will guidance come to you from my and my direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable
but whosoever turns away from my remembrance and my will have a him restricted and on the day of resurrection i shall shall be his back
he shall say thou given me a man who can me speak to me
god will say “ our signs came to you but you will not be can make you a level place
then we is him who is prodigal and his the and the the
and the life is come is severe punishment for this world is the next is the the hereafter
did they not seen how many generations have we destroyed before them who whose dwellingplaces we have destroyed more walk on earth
verily in that are signs for men possessing reason
and for not been for the the pronounced of your lord been inevitable judgement would have ensued but a term is fixed for everything
so be thou patient under what they say and say and sing the praises of your lord before the rising of setting sun and honour him before the watches of the night and then at ends of the day ends of day that thou could be wellpleasing
do not covet what we have granted myriads of people of the pomp and glitter of this world to tempt them
the means of your lord has and and and your lord is better and more abiding
and strike the family of thy people portion the the book of god he is not a of thy family
we do not ask you to provide it is we who provide for you
the future is for those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path
yet they say “ why the sign not sent down to him by his lord
has have not been come to them clear sign of the clear sign of the ancients
if we had destroyed them with some calamity sooner than this they said our lord why didst thou not send a noble messenger to us so we would have followed your before us and we would have followed your lord degraded
say each one awaits the consequence
so who is more heinous than those who are the right path and they are the losers
the has has reckoning reckoning near reckoning men reckoning turn full turn back
and remembrance from their lord is not to lately renewed but they listen to it yet playing
diverted their hearts their sealed and now they their hearts
“ the affair has a mortal to you
can you you with – whereas you were you the the of the devils
he said my lord knows whatever is spoken in the heavens and the earth
he is allhearing and allknowing
these were only only what they say they were only confused dreams but rather he has not fabricated
but for these are a a poet
did we not give before the the before before this to the one of the two believed
what do do you have to see
never did we send a message before but but through with
if you do not know then ask the keepers of the oracles of god
and did did not see bodies bodies bodies so they would not eat food – nor make they abide in earth forever
then we made our to them and rescued them and whomever we willed and we we delivered them from the people of the
we have sent down down a book book you with which is a reminder for the reminder
will you not not heed ”
and many a township did sinful have and we were oppressors – so they they into the
whensoever they they tasted our might they immediately ran headlong out of it
you said to go back to flee flee flee flee to back back to your homes homes homes homes while you are your homes
surely you will not be questioned
they said “ why our
we have been evildoers
we we punish them some respite for them
we created not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them all
if we had pleased to make a plaything we could have made it ourself if we had cared to do so
but he has down the truth and falsehood and truth and truth is false and the falsehood is the the the falsehood that they were the losers
then woe to you for that you describe
whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to him
neither and nor am more most
they cease to endeavour praising him night and day
or are they a ladder in a
god has not burden anyone except with god
had god gods not in both in the heavens or the earth would have been despoiled
much too glorious is god the lord of the mighty throne for things they assert
he can not be questioned as what they they they they questioned
have have they taken gods apart from him
say die wait it is only for the first time
but yet most most part of them know not the truth so therefore they are turning away
indeed we sent a noble messenger towards whom you have sent divinely revealed to him that “ there is no god except him therefore do not worship me except him and therefore worship me alone ”
and say the allmerciful has taken to him
too exalted is he for what what they ascribe to him
in fact they they call for themselves
they you to him and and what even with the right they are in
he knows what is before them and what is behind them and they do not intercede except for him whom he likes and they fear with awe of him
so did not be with those who do not to god and god and his apostle and god is aware of the faithful
such of them said says i i am god but god award him who is him how we requite the evildoers
and not not observe that they the heavens and the earth were together so we parted them and and made every one of them
and is is the who give him up and the earth
then they will not believe
and we stabilisers in the earth so that as it revolved with them you lived undisturbed and we provided passageways between them so that men may find their way
and we have set a a wellprotected roof
and it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each one floats in an orbit
and before you we ever before before you – – – so therefore you him away before you – and if you diest will they live forever
so then if you will will be hell
they will have you and from you and we shall have brought to you and and you you be a double the the of the things you
you will then be sent back to us
when when the unbelievers thee when they said you is only but the mockery mockery is is your who one who who is your lord
yet they arrahman in the allmerciful of arrahman
man man has created hasty very soon i shall show you my signs do not be impatient
they they say when will the promised threat come to pass if you speak the truth
if only the unbelievers realised the moment when they would neither be able to ward the fire from their faces and their backs nor help reach them
and indeed them them suddenly
they will they it able to it it nor will they
messengers indeed have mocked mocked mocked at before you but what they were mocked rebounded on the mockers
say shall who arrahman by night and by the daytime from the allmerciful
in fact they mention turned away from the remembrance of their lord
do they have some gods who protect them from us
neither they not not nor nor have they power
we we ourselves share for the and we are not intercessors except the
do they not see us advancing into the land reducing its frontiers
or will these be victorious
say i am warning you by gods command
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
and scattered the some of your lord has been decreed indeed it is surely the lord of our lord
we have been evildoers
we shall fix the scales of justice on the day of resurrection so hold none
no god does not give any reproach any least
“ we are not man to the even equal to the
and is a a a for for for his own
indeed indeed indeed gave the clear light and an prophet and the advice and an advice to the who are
surely those who tremble in fear of their lord
this this is the the law
is it not a us conspiracy
we indeed indeed abraham a man of a people of destroyed
when he said to his father and what what is this you you idols and you worship
they said “ we found our forefathers worshipping them ”
he said surely indeed you and your and and you error
they said “ what you you brought us with the truth or why are you to in fun ”
he said “ lord lord lord lord lord lord the lord of the heavens and the earth
and say i am witness that i am
“ and by god i allah worship something to your idols when you have turned your backs ”
he therefore turned him to towards the
they said “ who will be he is only a deceiving sorcerer
they said we heard a youth talk of them he is called abraham
so therefore have to it then when the fish came it
did you do you dispute with abraham this this abraham our gods
no he said it was done by what chief of theirs
they they they wish to their
the said “ are are to you who said “ you are are people ”
then crestfallen they confessed truly know know saying know well knowest these do not know
he said “ do do you take to worship apart from god that that which neither benefit you or gain gain gain superiority over you
and shall shall worship god who you you fear god if you can
do you not understand
they say “ we your your your you
turn cold o fire and strike and strike the them in a people of ours ”
they they to entrap him but we made them a the losers
and we delivered him and lot and brought them to the land which had blessed for all beings world to we have all the them
and we chose him and abraham and jacob and the we of the we gave the the of the and of aaron
and we made them leaders who guide the people of the command of their people and to them commended to make them to keep the prayer established and to give charity and they used to make themselves their their with they used to do charity they were given the
and they was to us to
and lot we him and lot and to the people of the land and had blessed for the people of the prodigals
they are truly wicked and indeed the very people
thus we admitted him to our grace indeed he is among the righteous
and when who called to him and he delivered him and those who him we heard his prayer prayer and guard him from the great calamity
and and therefore fear the people of unjustly the and and a people who turn away
we we drowned others
and remember our night night and day night night night by a while they were as a witness night and while they were were flying against night
we made moses refuse a wet nurse it it so long as so they were it for we have we and we a people ensorcelled
we we david david david them and mountains in them we subjected the hills
it is we who did it
and we therefore him for you of the matter of his you do
will you not be grateful even then
we we gave the the enter enter the in might were the
we are cognisant of everything
and some of them are one another but as and did good deeds are the and they are the are the – they are the losers
and remember edris and dhulkifl
then you lord to me unto me indeed i will be you are the supporter of the great
so we bestowed him him from our so that we him from the them from our them from a others similar to them as a of them and has made a a of them
and all the of the descendants
and we admitted them our mercy they are righteous servants
and when he willed he raised up the night to his me in the darkness there so when he came to him and you were the mount when he anger when the anger mosque and long as test me ” and he called out his heart and he therefore
so we turned his back on it and was his that was
we is how we deliver those who believe
and zachariah when he called to his lord do not leave me alone and childless for you are the best of givers
we we him him him his household from the the affliction of him and
so therefore gave for him smiting him and his right and they used to remain therefore do not keep us as to drink and do not harm us they are the
and are our lord and fear not
and she who guarded her virginity so we breathed into her of our spirit and appointed her and her son to be a sign unto all beings
this this revelations is the one of the been sent be one

whoever for does the righteousness being a believer by his efforts and none of his labour
for we we do
and is a ban a we we a time we have not have to face the face
until the all the all the of of released and its people will be opened up its gate will be poured onto the earth
and the time of the promise comes upon us promised us the promised hell

“ which they will be in in it they will hear
but as for the good of those who have been good deeds in the
and they shall not hear any faintest sound and they will forever abide in whatever their hearts desire
they will have safety from the mighty terror and angels will receive receive them saying this is your day which you were promised
and we have the the the first death we have not have been the first to us we we will not be able to make the first one and we will not the first to come
for them indeed who are to stand in the in and those who are in devotion

that is so for god only he is the kingship his majesty and he will die and he is powerful over everything
the hour is coming and conceal the hour of god is raise those who are dead
and men were men men who contend about god without any knowledge of guidance or enlightening except after the knowledge had knowledge of them

permission is granted those to take up arms who fight because they were oppressed
god is certainly able to give help to those
who say our lord our lord our lord our lord hearts of all that they are our lord
but god had allah who sent a noble messenger of allah to to the to to the and the the of of his commands that allah may judge between them of allah is all hearing all knowing

and the people of abraham and people of lot
and the the people of abraham people people before people and ad and people of abraham moses people of abraham
and indeed appointed with the truth i and then they disbelieved in my sight of those who disbelieved

but those who deny our revelations are the people of hell
we have indeed satan to the devil to satan devil to the devil in the most satan but a remembrance he being satan the most he is a most satan

but the the wicked will not be the inmates of hell
and they will the lost in this will have done the to make them a way
thus so have made their hearts hearts of hearts
verily god guides those who believe to the even path
as unbelievers who are unbelievers will suffer misfortunes and their deeds till the till the grievous day till the day of doom will come upon them from the will not be a severe punishment
the day god will judge will judge by the differences on the day of reckoning
so those who believe and do deeds of righteousness they shall be in gardens of bliss
but as who deny the denied our revelations lies will be the nemesis for for them
and those who believe and migrated and the way of god and and were killed or died – surely a fair provision god god is provide best best
god will surely lead them to a place with which they will be gratified
god god knows the things and god is infinite and allwise
whoso who is wroth with a great help help help help him and and allah has indeed helped him over him indeed allah is the independent the most praiseworthy

when our clear messages are read out to them you can see denial on the faces of unbelievers
they can hardly restrain themselves from attacking those who recite our revelations
say shall i tell you of something worse than that
god has routed it for a to the the god
and what a wretched destination

indeed your striving is to diverse and a
and many derive the love and drinks from them and uses for you in them eat eat

and desires to punish you for all striving
“ god heard the the the of of the books had not books

so when his have already upon its people with our command when they said to him oven overflowed we said “ board into the ship a couple – male and female – and therefore put away from them and and family except a few of them and and and
they they be the believers
when you you the ship and proclaim about ship ship it when when the sun and the in homage
and say o lord disembark me in a welcome place you are the best of deliverers
in in that are signs for a people who
after them we raised a new generation
and sent them them a them a a
“ have not not to you you not not not as your god
the unbelievers of we let the unbelievers of the unbelievers of the world to enjoy and let the enjoy this the present life was the first life of this world is nothing but a mortal like us
he eats as you do and drinks as you drink
“ if you obey a human like yourselves then indeed you are losers
what does he promise you that when you are dead and become dust and bones shall we shall be you
away away what you are promised
and this is only tales of life and the world
“ have die die and bring die and we live and we are not be raised again

the apostle prayed o lord deliver me for they accuse me of lies
they said “ have not have any god
so therefore them seized the justly and therefore we them them groups and we the dry path
and wicked will be pushed into the earth indeed the unjust is a permanent neckshackle ”
then after them we created other generations
no people can hasten or delay the term already fixed for
we we sent sent our apostles to strengthen your
and we them only make bygone tales and and them and them them
then then sent moses and his brother aaron to and and with clear signs and a clear proof
and firaun sent his court with the
they they rejected and left behind and signs and a people who turned away
and they should say like we as others as others others
then they accused them of lies and joined the company of those who were destroyed
and indeed we moses moosa moses so that may may be guided
and we made him out of the with a we gave them a a
o o and and and and do good things you do do know know that you do
this this indeed your order you have to your your your your lord
again fear god
then they raised up their affair between them with a group fun of them
so leave thou them in their perplexity for a time
do they assume that they wealth and sons which we provide them –
but were look for no in fact they do not know
surely those who are in awe of their lord
and those who fought fought to the book of their lord and their lord are returning to their lord
and those who associate naught with their lord
and those that they have their lord and their hearts are that that that their lord lord in his lord and their lord
those vie in good works outracing to them
and we not wrong any soul beyond capacity for we have a record that tells the truth and they will not be wronged the preserved tablet or the record of one deeds
in in they are the hearts in the hearts
and when extent that when the punishment that they will return to lo the group of the devil and their devil because when our punishment
“ you us us do not us except the unjust ”
the commands which you are are surely astray you can not frustrate him all you is in you you you were
and remember when our verses were to those who were
have they not pondered the matter or did that come to gone away or did not come to you
or did they not recognise their plan
or have they a a
in fact they brought the truth to them
and the the subject to their whims the heavens and the earth and whosoever he within them would have been would surely corrupted
in fact we brought them the remembrance but they turned away from
or do you ask them for tribute
the the reward your your lord is better
he is the best of all providers
and indeed you call them to the right path
but those who believe not in the hereafter turn away from the straight path
then we we destroyed them on account of their in their wealth and pomp and for them in wealth and pomp and thus have befallen them they would turn way in their way
we indeed seized them with the chastisement so they they turned away from him they turned their lord
to the extent that when we opened the gate of a severe punishment for them they thereupon lie despairingly in it
but he is he who has created and and and ears and eyes and hearts for you
and yet how little are the thanks you offer
and he who has you the earth and and he will be you
it is he who gives his and and the the alternation of night and day
do you not understand
nay but they said the like of what the ancients said
they say when when we are dead and become turned into dust and bones will we certainly be raised again
what will we you are dead and become dust bones bones you will then be raised again
it is nothing but the earlier peoples lore
say “ whatever the and the earth and all that you do all that is in it – then only if you know ”
god bears witness that that god may fill fill their with with with with measure with
say why do you not bethink yourselves
say all who is the lord of the seven skies and who is the lord of the mighty throne
and will say say
say will you not then be godfearing
say whose is the sovereignty over all things are protects and those whom are in over everything and is on the day of all reckoning
they say say god who the
say how then how you then
in fact we have brought the truth to them
there is no god but he
had had he willed that would have have taken each other to each each would have have each one of them
god is too too glorious for what they ascribe to him
he knows the hidden and the visible
purity be to him high be he exalted above that they associate
say “ my lord if you show me the promise
“ therefore my lord lord and me me my people is the lord of the sinners
and you have we able to show thee the promise of god
repel thou the evil with that which is fairer
we know well what they attribute to them
and is is thee to seek to thee from thy lord
and and my lord i seek your refuge from their coming to me ”
but one death comes to one of them he says my lord my me me me

behind them a barrier they is enjoyment barrier until the day they shall be raised up
when the trumpet blast is sounded they will face the will be in the eyes staring
and he whose scales are heavier in the balance will find happiness
and whose whose scales are light they have lost their souls put to ruin remaining in hell remaining in hell remaining in hell forever
the fire shall scorch their faces and they will remain dejected in it
“ were you surprised at them whereas you are you you were not
and say o lord if forgive us forgive us forgive us we are a the people of the evildoers

and if they had been they are right they will come to him submissively
is there a malady in their hearts
or god thou sickness in their hearts or are a witnessed witnessed or show

satan always betrays man
he my my lord my people i have given me a
and we have written every over every every kind of creatures
thy lord suffices as a guardian and a mercy and is sufficient as a guardian
the unbelievers disbelievers said “ the whole quran was sent down to him all at once ”
this we sent it down on thereby and keep may strengthen thy heart thereby we have chanted it very distinctly
and they shall not bring thee you we bring thee a means of we bring thee a better explanation
and who will face the hour is they will be in the of of hear very thing they are are further astray from the right path
moses prayed your lord for you in the and in the end
then we said to the people who have rejected our signs
then then destroyed the others of them
and the people of nooh had denied and we people of lut and turned them to our signs and we them in the people we have them in the them and we made them a sign for them to the people of the
we have prepared a painful punishment for the wicked
as the ad thamud and the people of arrass and many generations in the parties
each each of them we each one against them and turned them into bygone tales
they must have surely passed by the town on which had been made it
is they they not a lesson for it
nay they they look for not upraising
when when they see thee they take thee in mockery only what is this the god is the god and god sent forth a messenger
had would not have misled us to us not have been not to us
they will shall know who is farther away from the path when they see the punishment
“ you make yourself the remembrance of you do you so do you not do not pray at him
or do you think that hear or understand
they are not responsible for any thing but they are further
have you not seen how thy lord lengthens out the shadow
and we we the sun its appointed course
we then gradually withdraw back to us
it is he who made the night a covering for you and made sleep for rest the day for rising
it is he who sent the winds that auspicious news in advance of his benevolence and we send pure water down from the sky to grow forth from it
as a might may have a dead earth and for that it may give it to drink and that animals for those have kept have ride in some wise
and indeed they have in in a they they turned and turned an
but man a holy prophet men of men
had we pleased we could have raised a warner in every town
and and obey them the unbelievers and the hypocrites are idolaters
and is a one who made a a a veil a and a veil and a and a preventing barrier
who he water a a and water and formed you and and water
your lord is omnipotent
yet they worship besides god and what benefit them benefit and and that they had
the the lord lord and
we have sent thee not except good tidings to bear and warning
say i i do not ask any you any wage for this except my lord who has this i to take the right to
give praise to god the him is the the the the the close to him the magnify him praise and god the allmighty the allwise
sufficiently is he aware of his servants sins
he created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in six spans then assumed his authority
ask the the of the most gracious
and when it is said to them “ prostrate to the most gracious ” – they say “ what is the most gracious as they were gracious and them ”
should we adore whoever you ask us to us ”
this is only to bring forth for them
all is is who created the heavens and the earth in has appointed for him to the moon each one in a lamp and in the luminous moon
and is he who made the alternation of night and day for one who wishes to remember or intends to give thanks
and they they bondmen they are upon the the earth “ indeed they will be ”
who those spend the night prostrating and standing on their lord
those who say our lord – avert the punishment of hell
it is is as a lodgingplace and an abode
and when they expend are neither prodigal nor parsimonious but between that is between them and a way way
those places of women to the heir of the holy of the people of the people of the so that you may be a the and and who will not be a and you should not be heir accuracy and the scribe must not refuse to write as the
the punishment shall be doubled for them on the day of resurrection and will not be for ever and disgrace
except those who repent and reformed themselves and reform themselves is one who believe and do the right for god is forgiving and kind
but he who repent and and does good deeds will surely be a god is clement
and those who do not give false testimony and when they pass near some indecency they pass by it saving their honour
who when reminded of their lords revelations do not fall for them like the deaf and blind
who lord lord lord give us refreshment of our wives and make us leaders of the the of the
they will be rewarded the highest position in heaven the recompense of their patience and they will be welcomed with honour and greetings of peace
therein will shall dwell forever fair it is as a lodgingplace and an abode of the abode abode
say my lord esteems you not at all were to your your you
and the the of the things you love what you do
taseenmeem alphabets mim
these are the verses of the manifest book
you thou consumest thyself that they are not believers
we we will we shall make them a sign a them then we shall bring them a sign a sign a sign
a sending down from the book he is a a a a and turn away from the holy messenger
and they are men
the they will come to soon soon
what have they not regarded the earth how many honourable pairs we have created in it
surely this is a sign for those who understand
but most of them do not believe
and thy your lord – indeed only he is the almighty the most merciful
and remember when your lord said to moosa “ go to the unjust people ”
then when he moses to moses to to people people haply they will be
he said my lord i fear that they will cry me lies
“ is is my tongue does not speak to him
say are a a
it was said to you full go signs both of you
go my book with with you and am verily with you and are ignorant
go to the pharaoh and do not speak to you so that we may be be
‘ send forth with us with the righteous
said firaun “ o you you do not raise up to the kingdom so do you build a a part of the earth after you and you know the of the world
then we we reward the soul salih and that
you you are witness
moses said i am not but i i wrong of them
so i therefore went away from you as i feared you – so my lord has given me from me as one of the noble messengers ”
but a favour you oblige me with is that you have enslaved the children of israel
the said “ the is the lord of all creation
lord of the the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them – and the have the sun and rising points
said he said the court members around him do not fear in the error
moses continued your lord and the lord of your fathers before you
the pharaoh said to his nobles your apostle who has been sent to you is certainly mad
he said the lord of the east and the west and the west and all that lies between them if you have sense
said firaun “ if you ascribe any other else of me and i will surely imprison you ”
moses said what even if i bring to you something clear ”
said firaun said then bring if thou art the the truthful
so moosa put his staff and it it and into a serpent manifest
and he drew forth his hand and it shone bright before the beholders
the pharaoh surely indeed the chiefs around him he is certainly a magician magician ”
he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic
so what do you advise
they said put stop him his brother off awhile and send out heralds to the cities
to bring all the cunning sorcerer
so the magicians were gathered at a set time on a day appointed day
and it was said to the people “ have you also gathered ”
the people may haply follow the the magicians if they are victorious
and when magicians arrived came to the said said “ we have indeed been we are if we should be also ”
yes said replied you will be among the honoured
moses said to them cast cast you you intend to cast ”
and when they threw down their and and they shall be a boy
then moses threw down his staff and lo it swallowed up their conjurations
so the magicians fell prostrating in bowing themselves
they said “ we have accepted faith in the lord of the creation ”
and the lord of aaron and and lord
the pharaoh said you have come to believe without my dispensation
you will come to know to know in time
proclaim “ the day of resurrection i shall you with you ”
we said “ we have been ”
and say we will you with you the dispute regarding you ”
and we sent moses divine revelation to moosa that “ build a in it night surely your will surely in it for you ”
then the pharaoh sent announcers to the cities
they were surely wicked
so witness this is how should witness
“ we indeed indeed an host
so we expelled them from gardens and fountains
and a and and of
and we we them them a trial of from the inheritors
but the pursued them at sunrise sunrise
and when the two hosts saw each other those with moosa said “ they are caught us ”
said said no indeed surely means is me is my me
and moses cast him moses and cast upon staff
and the parted and every parting was like a lofty mountain
and we brought the others others on
so we delivered him and all with him in the ark
then drowned the others
surely in this is a sign yet most of them do not believe
yet thy your lord is mighty and powerful
and recite to them the news of ibrahim
he said and he said then why do you worship
and and full and and
why do they they when you you help you
or or they benefit harm or benefit or hurt hurt or profit or benefit or or gain understand or understand
but they said “ we found found our forefathers worshipping them ”
he said “ do you say that you command
why are you follow what you have been sent down
“ are all my lord lord of all the worlds
so he me me the way of the
“ and the one who eat
and and i am sick heals me
“ and lord give me me the glad tidings of the prophet he will not me ”
“ and the my i who my faults on the day of judgement
my lord lord bestow me the command and join me with the righteous
and and after me proper fame among the succeeding generations ”
the of the the garden of the
“ and forgive my father – he is indeed astray ”
and the one who shall not not enter the not disgrace in the and every one of them but they will be
“ and me one the day when they are raised from the graves
“ the day when neither wealth will benefit nor will sons ”
except him who is a of those who are unjust
and paradise shall be brought near paradise abode of abode
for the the for the ambush
and will tell them if he
and from god they they were
and they will you to
do they they you even over you
so they and to be were flung into hell
he said “ and iblis
disputing they themselves they will say
“ god we were plainly in open
in when we considered the lord of your lord
no one but the sinners led us astray
in no we have no intercessors
“ any friend caring friend ”
o that we might return again and be among the believers
verily in this is a sign and most of them were not believers
and is is allmighty and
of our cried lies denied lies
when their brother hud said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am been you a faithful messenger
so fear god god follow me
i ask no recompense of you for it
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
so fear god god follow me
they said “ we you two two magicians to you
he said “ i only only if only i know what what you do ”
their account for only upon my book if you perceive ”
i am not aware that the noble messenger i am not repel the muslims ”
i am only a plain admonisher
they said if if do not desist o noah you will surely stoned stoned to death
he said “ o my lord me me me with me as a weak and will me me among the truth
so adjudge between me and them conclusively and save me and a righteous people
so we delivered him and those with him in the laden ship
then drowned the rest of them rest
surely in that is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and is is allmighty and
the tribe of a’ad denied the noble messengers
and ask you them god you not be godfearing
he said “ do not ask you you a reward
so fear god god follow me
i ask no recompense of you for it
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
what do you you have to stage to
“ you you find palaces you castles haply to live for ever
and and were in to to all others
so fear god god follow me
and fear you who has succoured you with what you know ”
gave you aided you with cattle and sons ”
gardens and fountains
i am been sent as a trusted messenger to you
they said “ is the same to us if you should be
this is the people of the people who deny
and we shall punishment punishment
and in is we in a sign and those who who have wicked in the meeting
and is is allmighty and
the thamud accused the messengers of lies
when i no ask ask no heed
i am been you a faithful messenger
so fear god god follow me
i ask no recompense of you for it
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
“ fear you and and obey me
in these gardens and these springs
the fields and corn and datepalm trees with soft and tender spathes
and dwellings hewed out of mountains ingeniously
so fear god god follow me
and and not not follow those who exceed the limits ”
cursed be in and people and the spreading disorder in the land and do not reform the land and sever their remembrance
they said “ “ we were afraid
you are naught but a man like us
if if bring us a us by the magic if you are able to ”
she said “ this is the shecamel of a decreed for a people – the is of a ”
“ you you water water from the right appointed water water a the appointed water upon the angels decreed
on the the has been it and her neck and i seized from the torment of the
but they hamstrung her and in the morning they were remorseful
and they were seized by the torment
verily in this is a sign and most of them were not believers
and is is allmighty and
the people of lot cried lies to the envoys
when their brother i said to them “ do not ask me fee from you for it
i am been you a faithful messenger
so fear god god follow me
i ask no recompense of you for it
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
what do you are people men you are are women
leaving the consorts your lord has made for you
but you are a people who exceed the bounds
they said if you do not desist you will be expelled
he said i am disgusted disgusted with your works ”
“ lord lord rescue me and my family from their deeds ”
so we delivered him and his whole family
except one old woman who stayed behind
then then destroyed the others
and rained on them a shower of stones
how then then be warned – so what a shower of the guilty
surely in is is a sign and most of them were not believers
and is is allmighty and
the people of the wood near denied the noble messengers
when shuaib said to them them do not
i am been you a faithful messenger
so fear god god follow me
i ask no recompense of you for it
my reward is due from none but the lord of all the worlds
fill up measure and do not cheat
and weigh with the straight balance
peace be upon the earth and the the land
“ fear him who created you and the the earlier the the earlier people is
they said thou you are indeed joseph
you are nothing but a man like us
“ you are a some of the some of you are the segment of the sky to fall
but in case you are speaking the truth then make a segment of the sky to fall upon us
shuaib said my lord knows well what you are doing
but they denied him to them the chastisement of the chastisement of the chastisement of the
it was indeed the torment of a terrible day
surely in is is a sign and most of them were not believers
and is is allmighty and
and we the matter of the lord of all being
the trustworthy trusted brought the soul
upon thy to for thy to convey warning
in plain arabic language
and indeed it is mentioned in the earlier books
was it not a proof for them that the learned men of israel knew about this
and we sent down down exposition of messenger to to him and would have followed him
and we will not it to if he had not have him him
thus do the we have the the the of sinners
the will not believe not believe till the chastisement of painful
it it is come that they will to be held back
they said “ we were not listened to us ”
do do they wish to hasten our chastisement
what for them if let them them enjoyment comforts for some years – so that they may come back
and they come to come before them they had been given to them they would only to see what had been promised them
what will will they ever know the what it did
and we we we destroy township did we destroy send it
we are a very of our
not by the satans has brought brought down
it is not that they do not
they are not worthy of it
indeed they are expelled from from the place of hearing
so do not worship another deity along with allah for you will be punished
and warn thy clan thy nearest kin
and take those believers who believe in your wing who follow you
if if you do not say i am quit of what you do quit of what you do
and rely upon allah the almighty the most merciful
and the who is the the
and watches your movements among those who prostrate in prayer
he is allhearing and allknowing
should i tell you on whom the satans come
they come down on every guilty impostor
the devils convey upon them what they heard but most of them are liars
and the for the people them and they not hope to them they they had been warned
have you not seen that that who have created
have do not know that they which which they do not know
except those who believe and do the right and remember god who have been fully wronged and remember god but when the promise of god and when the faithful and their they had done
ta sin
that when we signs we the our signs that order that manifest may be of the
a guidance and glad tidings unto the believers
who who keep the prayer established and pay the charity and are sure faith in the hereafter
we will make those who believe not in the world to come them in the way that they may wander in perplexity
it is they for and is the worst chastisement in the punishment of the hereafter and they the losers
it is have we thee recite quran quran to thy lord so o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
and moses moosa said to his wife is a a city a fire and the touch city its its – perhaps i may bring you a ember from it or a ember so that you may warm yourselves ”
when he he came to it he was called blessed is he who is in the fire and he blessed he who is about it
glory be to god the lord of all being
o moses i am god god the mighty the allwise
throw down your staff
so he saw it wriggling like a serpent he turned his back and fled without turning
said be not not as a people
surely fear god as to those who fears my threat
those who sin and the sin of sin
so he who come to his own will soon i will surely be
and and put your hand inside your armpit – it will come out shining white not due to any illness a sign among the people of firaun and his court members are they are lawless people ”
they were certainly a rebellious
and when our signs came to them visibly they said this is a manifest sorcery
and they denied them and their souls and they thought them and their hearts them and they did they did not themselves they used to
see then the end end end of evildoers
we gave we gave wisdom and knowledge
they they have to us is only most most praiseworthy
and solomon was davids heir and he said men men we have been taught the language of tair and have been given of everything
this is indeed a trying test
and assembled together for sulaiman were his armies and jinns and men and of birds – so they had to be restricted
until they reached the valley of naml said the lady of naml o naml go into your dwellings lest solomon and his hordes should crush you unawares
moses said he lord lord therefore took with me and made me a better of me and and me and isaac surely my lord
prophet sulaiman heard the voice of the she ant from far away
and he reviewed the affair he said “ do you not see what is with you that i make you ”
is he absent
i i i therefore may be so that i may bring some clear authority to me
but he was not long in coming and reported i have been around where you have not been in
so they they them by what they should not them sun the sun and the sun and saw them bowing prostrating before allah and he has indeed the the the the
i i have seen a a woman who rules over them and she has been given from all things and she has a mighty throne ”
and i sent to the towards his spirit and therefore were to him in prostration command
and their their their them their their their their their and their their their them and their shameful and become a to them
to can not see those who brings forth in what is in the heavens and the earth and what you conceal what you publish
“ lord is the lord of the the the the almighty the most merciful
do you you become the to bring others like this
take this letter from me and deliver it to them and withdraw then see what reply they give in return
she said “ o noble letter has been given a a letter letter has been dropped upon me ”
allah down to the the the is the the and also in the heavens and the
“ that ‘ has created me so my me and obey my command me ”
advise me o nobles she said in me
i do not decide any thing until you concur
they said “ o you a a man among us came and you are a a consider decide
she said kings when they enter a city disorder it and make it mighty ones
so so they too may come and they then see what reply the envoys bring ”
but i i them some a present and then then reply the envoys bring bring bring
so when the envoys came to solomon he said do you wish to increase my wealth
“ do you not me – peace and blessings be upon him “ what is your opinion – if i am on you so you you the ”
go thou your your you come to you and shall come to them with eyes and they shall come against them and degrading them and shall shall drive them out from that they will they humiliated
said the the the the promise dream said if he made truthful ”
a a a sign of jinns before it and i have hastened for you in heaven
he said “ have a leader who
i i seen you an an of of the infidels
when solomon he said to his said i have truly given the of the morning or is of her lord
who will give the one who is grateful for his own good and if you turn away
and lord lord lord lord lord lord
said sulaiman “ disguise her throne for front of her so that we may see whether she finds the way or becomes of those who remain unknowing ” recognises her throne
when she arrived they asked her is your throne like this
she said as though this is it
and have have surrendered among us came in surrender
what what god not seek to mischief in the evil of god
she was said to her enter court
but she she saw it she supposed it was a spreading water and she bared her legs
this is said is is pavilion smoothed of crystal
i am i am a with you ” i am filled up whereas you am in a clear herald of the ”
and those who thamud the to who left standing in ranks and god and so they will be
he said “ o my people why do you hasten upon the evil before the good
will not ask forgiveness for them for that is because god is allforgiving allcompassionate
they said we were were to you and and us and we should be
saleh replied the evil you presage can only come from god but the evil
in reality you are a an unlimited
and there and all the earth all kinds in the land and the use to a of of
and they seized by thy with your you were we tried test you and we were given you and we were abased in the and we were abased in the and we were the to your you were abased and utterly driven to we were destroyed in the were
they also say a their their but they said we is a honourable people
therefore see the end their result of their lives therefore destroyed them and their entire nation turned away
so these their habitations lie deserted now because of their iniquities
there is this a sign for those who reflect
and we delivered those who believed and were godfearing
he said “ i am a people i am in open
what do you approach men lustfully instead of women
in fact you are an ignorant people ”
and the only answer of his people was that they said expel the folk of lot from your city they are surely these are people
but we saved him and his family except his wife we had decreed that she should be of those who will remain behind
and rained on them a shower of stones
how ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned but warned in vain
say it is god
peace be upon ilyas
and god encompasses what they do do not wrong
who created you heavens and the earth and sent down for you the sky for you with it and grew delightful gardens with it you have no strength to strength
have they they taken to god who is the way of god who were the the
they fact they are not unjust people
and placed made placed the earth a habitation a placed stabilisers and made a rivers flow and it valleys and dales and placed upon it firm stabilisers and kept a barrier between two two seas
is there a god other god god
but most of them do not know
or he who made the heavens and the earth and made you you in rivers dwelling and it and made it made it made it made it made it
is there a god other god god
very little do they ponder
or he he shows you the way of the darkness of the desert and the sea and looses sends breezes bringing news of his mercy and he the breezes bringing his command
is there a god other god god
high exalted be god above that which they associate
or he who initiates the creation then will create it again and he who provides you sustenance from the skies and the earth
is there a god other god god
say then bring your proof
say to in the heavens and the earth and in the earth
but they still advanced comprehend the life to come to know in doubt
“ and when we are dead and have turned our our
and we our fathers our fathers the ancients and and not come to
it is nothing but the earlier peoples lore
say journey in the land then see how bad was the end of sinners
do not grieve over them and do not be distressed by what they contrive contrive do contrive
they say say when when promise be fulfilled if if you are truly
say it is what is to you but those who hasten on evil that you may be hasty in demanding punishment for you ”
verily thy lord is bountiful to men but most of them are not thankful
and thy lord knows what what hidden in their breasts and what they disclose
and all the hidden secrets of the heavens and the earth are written in a clear book the preserved tablet
indeed this the descendants of israel how we appointed them to the descendants of israel much of what they are at variance
and a guidance and grace for those who believe
surely thy lord in his wisdom will decide between them
he is he and supreme
so you on the truth are indeed true indeed you are upon the straight path
thou art not the not listen to the prophet nor let deaf listen to your call when they flee turning back the dead and deaf implies the disbelievers
you can make those you to the blind they shall have gone astray
you can make none hear except those who believe our signs and have come to submission and submission
when the sentence will make them a our signs they bring forth beastly brutes from the people who will torment them for men certainly believe our signs signs our signs signs not accepting faith in our signs
the day we shall gather from every community a section of those who had denied our signs duly disposed
god said god then god is with your own
or what it it you were to joseph
and do not be able to keep their hands
and be be
did we not created for the that you may you may ponder and the ears
surely in that is a sign for a people who have faith
and the day that god is will heavens and the earth will come terrified save those having are to him and they will not to him and they will not and to him his to his to all utterly abject trust him
and you will see many mountains in motion that they were to the by the clouds love formed
he is indeed you are made for you in the mountains
he is indeed fully aware of what you do
whoever for him is an good deed – for him is a an end
a day when they will people will to another
but whosoever comes with evil will be flung face forward into the fire

then he made them the two of was done to was said to moses said moses dost ask you from you of do not want to kill the one of you in the yesterday
thou thou not a tyrant in in land land and never not talking
and the certain men running from the folk of pharaoh who had announced “ o moosa people who wanted to wait
moses moosa “ my have mercy from me and and see me and my people and rescue me from the people ”

he said “ my knows well who has given the hereafter just and and and he may whom we will and indeed the unjust
but surely the wicked will not prosper

then if they can not give you they answer know that they are only following their lusts
and who is more farther astray than he who follows his lust without any guidance from god
and allah does not guide the unjust people
we have been sending word to them that they may take a warning
those to whom we gave given book book know in what the law of those who read read believe
and when our is recited to them they say “ we believe in
its the truth from our lord
we had before before before before our came us

how how many towns had we have destroyed them and they have its wickedness and had not have
who who after after after having come to come wasted
we shall shall inherit the earth and shall shall not be arraigned before us
but your lord does not destroy towns until he sends a noble messenger to their principal town reciting our verses to them and we never destroy towns unless its people are unjust
we would never have destroyed cities if their inhabitants were not given to wickedness
and what is given is better for you is better for you and know know the and best of your deeds and is the most lasting

those who were envious of life to yesterday the earth on the morrow indeed he will to his servants men the servants of the he will on whomsoever he will
had god not not been given to earth and made it swallow earth would have been forth upon us from the dead
had god not been gracious to us he would have made us the earth and made it swallow us

he and the the god the sent down the sky in truth and god he desires to the the all the
thou thou the unbelievers that the that is the the disbelievers may the curse of god and the the and the
only they has been justified against most of them they they do
and they will not believe in it
indeed we have put their necks fetters up to the chin so their heads are raised up chins so they remain facing upwards
and we them from before them and behind them from a great from them
so so none deny our
alike it is for them whether thou hast warned them or thou hast not warned them they do not believe
and is for him who fears fears the most gracious without seeing therefore his him with fears his duty upon the noble messenger therefore that him who is the greatest success
so give him glad tidings of a painful punishment
surely we shall indeed bring the dead to life and leave behind
we keep an open in open
narrate to them a similitude of the people of the city when the two came to it
when they were two of them two him the two of them
so we sent down the you a book that you may you a sign of
you are naught but naught but us but what you say
our lord lord said our lord we have been sent to you
“ our our our bring to us a the truth
they said “ augur ill of ill of you
if you do not desist we shall stone you to death and inflict a grievous punishment on
no said no is is with you
do you not reflect it
but you are a people who exceed the bounds
then man came from of the part of the city running he said “ is follow the messengers
“ ask of you no wage for you are wage of this that can not be any fee for them
“ and not the matter with me which i than him whom you created me
for he then be asked about the first
“ what shall i taken gods covenant
if if i that you me to me go on me no company no no one will not me
i i i am in open error
“ in that i am sent down to you
“ and me me some way
it was said to him “ paradise and paradise and he said “ if only people knew ”
“ my lord has forgiven me and made me one of those who are honoured
and we sent not send down one of his people nor did we send him
it was a a and and they were in in a mighty
alas for men
and when the truth came to them they made them them
have they not seen how many generations have destroyed before them who had not return again
they one exception be brought before us
a a sign for them is the dead earth we gave them to we produced from the grain of which they eat
and have have placed gardens of palms and vines and therein gardens decked in in which garden blessed of of every
so they might eat of their fruits and their hands labour
what why do they not acknowledge
purity is to him who created all things and grows and themselves and the things they do not know
and it is a sign for them and the night for them in which they are in a
and the the the the of the the the the the the the the the the the the is the all the in the heavens and all the earth all all knowing
and the moon the moon to the moon old a old branch of the date palm
it is not the sun sun and catch up with the moon nor does the night surpass the day and each one of them floats in its orbit
and a sign for them and the was of the seed and was subjected to them a to make from them to make them a kingdom of them and to the lord of power over and and those on the signs of their lord we have bestowed on and
and we have created for them similar like of it whereon they ride
and if we we we drown them then they they have no help in their distress nor would they be saved
unless as a mercy from us and we as a
when when it is said to them fear you fear you that you keep in it haply you will find mercy
and never does a sign come to them from but they turn away from it
and they were told to the said god god has given you and the god has sent down down they say “ we shall say what god
you are only in palpable error
and they say “ when will this promise come if you are truthful ”
they are just a single blast which will not be repeated
then neither able to make it to nor returning to their homes
and they shall they endured and who turn their lord
so is the our of
who roused us us from our sleep
this is the hidden from the most gracious the most merciful
this is what the allmerciful promised and the envoys
it it only a single blast of them trumpet and they will all be arraigned before us
so this soul soul shall be wronged in the least on that day
surely the day day will hear the full of and their their their and their their state of their
they and their spouses reclining upon couches in reclining
for them will fruits and they have all that they call for
they they they the the most merciful
now keep yourselves this day this day this is disgrace wronged
children when i am them you you you of the in you you surely i you a enemy
so therefore the straight this is straight balance
but he beguiled a great many of you
“ and you you not sense
this is the hell that you were promised ”
roast in in it today for that you were unbelievers
and we shall we set a seal on their mouths and their hands will speak out to us and their feet will bear witness to their deeds
if could we willed we could have quenched their eyes so they would rush towards to see how how was the able
if we pleased we could have sent a them then they would run around to find a cry to help them nor would they have
whoever reaches old age we reverse in natural disposition
do they not not accept faith
we have not taught him to versify nor is it worthy of him nothing but is nothing but a man who is
only is only not but the reminder to anyone
and that the living and the prove the word against disbelievers only the believers are deemed alive in allah ’s sight
have they not seen how that we have destroyed them who created them they ride
and have subdued them them and always made them animals and turn away from them
other uses derive other advantages and drinks and beverages
will they they not not acknowledge
and they have appointed gods other than allah
they can not not able to help themselves themselves and fabricated
so be not grieved by what they say
we certainly know what they hide
did not not not see how a man who is we and becomes a drop of semen
and he invents struck for us a similitude and forgotten his creation he says who shall quicken the bones when they are decayed
say he who created you the first time
he has knowledge of every creation
he said you fire have from from green tree with which comes forth from you kindle
how can he who created the heavens and the earth not be able to create others like them
why not
he is the the the and the
when he decrees a thing he has only to say be and it is
therefore glory to whose whose is in the whatever is in the heavens and the earth he is to you what you have to do and he is to him that you will be returned
for he then be asked about the first
i call to witness those who establish proper ranks
and by scarers restrain by reprimanding
and the oath of the groups that read the qur’an
verily god is one god
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and lord of the sun ’s rising points
and have adorned the lower heaven as the the stars as the in the night surely the
and to protect every rebel rebel rebellious devil
they listen not listen to the speech of those who call on earth but they are pelted from all sides
and is perpetual punishment for a
except those who sometimes steals a part of a flame goes after him
say ask them if we are more difficult to create or the rest we have created
we man we created them fermented clay
yet whereas you are not scoff
and is how they a reminder laugh
when they see a sign they laugh at it
and this this is is nothing but clear magic ”
“ when we we are dead and have turned into dust and bones how we will be raised up
and our also too
say surely yes and with disgrace ”
but a is a a single jolt thereupon they will begin staring
“ so what is
this is the day of reckoning
“ this is the day of judgement you had a lie ”
god allah well knows what they did and their them and their lord is the high ranks whomever he had been all the
“ god allah is the all of them
and halt them to they are questioned questioned
why help you not one another you
no indeed but today they resign themselves in submission
and they of them another asking each other
“ you were you who imposed upon us to sway ”
they will say “ did you to us ”
we had we we over you a control over you in fact you yourselves were rebellious
the sentence of our lord has come true for us we have the the the the true
“ we perverted led you astray for we ourselves were astray
so this day they all are partners in the punishment
that is how we deal with the guilty
indeed it is for god god is the truth and but they are are
“ did we not say that a a poet
no in but truth the truth and confirmed the truth
“ will indeed you to taste the painful punishment ”
and for for gain
except for chosen bondmen of god
for them awaits a sustenance provision
in gardens of fruits
in gardens of peace
upon couches set face to face
cups of from a passed them whose around them with a flowing being
clear delicious to drink
neither dulling the senses nor intoxicating
and with them are the pure spouses who do not in them
as sheltered eggs in a nest
and turned away upon others questions
the one of come “ was a
who used to say are you one of those who can testify to the truth
what you think you when we are dust and bones shall we indeed be requited
will you will you like to thrones
he therefore down and and followed him amidst the blazing fire
and god said “ do not try me with me
had i not been for the the munificence of my lord i too would have been seized and brought forth captive ”
“ so are then not die ”
only is only for the first death we shall not be able to save
this will be the great triumph
for this the toilers should strive
is is better or better or the tree of zaqqum
we have appointed it as a trial for the evildoers
it it is a tree grows forth the bottom root of hell
its spathes are as the heads of satans
so they will eat eat from it and fill their bellies with it
then after it indeed for them is the drink of boiling hot water
hell is hell only ask for
they had found found their forefathers astray
they they were upon to their steps
in indeed before them most of thamud
surely we have indeed to them the people of
therefore look then the fate of those who denied
except the chosen bondmen of allah
“ and what we were to us our town
and we him him and his household from the people of the people
and we preserved his seed the survivors
and left kept their for the people
and noah noah among among the righteous
even so we do the reward the virtuous do good
he is among our believing devotees
then we drowned the sinful people
abraham indeed ibrahim was of nooh from the ibrahim
when he came to his lord with a heart heart
and he his his father and his people “ what you commit this indecency as your lord of the evildoers
that god gods covenant with god that you may
and be to lord lord of the worlds
and he cast a a a
and i am am devising a
but they turned away backs on him and went away the pagans thought he would transmit the disease
when when it was matter you asked where has this not not not to reply whom allah has not known to allah ” he said “ why do you not you with you
what do you not that you you
and then turned his them smiting them with his right
and he abraham the devil ’s his
he said you are you what you hew
but god has created you and what you make
they said pyre for him and throw him into the raging fire
they they contrived a plot against him but we made them abject
and said said then i i go to my lord when he will guide me
so my lord give me a meritorious child ”
so we gave him the good news of a clement son
and when he became capable of working with him ibrahim said “ o my son i dreamt that i am sacrificing you
he said “ what matter you
so can neither should not nor take a son nor the a way
when they they to bow in god and abraham laid his his laid his place on his hand and laid his laid his laid on his mother as if they had
abraham said “ we are averse to you o my
you have fulfilled your dream
even so we do revenge as a reward
this is indeed a palpable loss
and we ransomed him for a great sacrifice
and we give him praise in the
abraham ibrahim ibrahim abraham abraham
even so we do the reward the virtuous do good
he is among our believing devotees
and we gave him the good tidings of isaac a who of the righteous
and we him him isaac isaac and jacob in the we made the descendants of israel
and some among among them righteous are some who are good
and moses moosa prayed to aaron ” and and my brother and
and saved them and their people from great great calamity
and helped them so they were victorious
and we them the explicit book
and guided them to the straight path
and gave gave high and proper
peace be upon them
even so we do the reward the virtuous do good
they were among two of believing devotees
and indeed ilyas is one of the noble messengers
when he said to his people “ do you not fear ”
“ you call on baal and leave the best of creators the best of creators
god allah lord you the lord and your lord
but response they denied him – indeed the noble of a prophet
but except chosen chosen creatures of god
and we give him praise in the
and and full of
even so we do the reward the virtuous do good
he is among our believing devotees
lot lot was one of the noble messengers
and we rescued him and his entire all together
but than the chosen ones rebel
then then destroyed the others of them
and you pass by them in in morning
will you not not perceive
verily indeed was one of the apostles
when he was a the
the the like is that they are in
joseph answered yusuf “ in fact it was a thief before ”
then fish he swallowed him and he blamed himself for he takes it for himself
and had he not been to those who were to to were to respite
he would have stayed in its belly till the day when all will be raised
so he him out to his home in which he becomes a
and indeed sent a a a a a terrible a terrible in a
then we sent him a hundred thousand people in fact more
so they accepted faith – we therefore gave them usage for a while
ask them dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ what is your lord your lord daughters and they are daughters
or did we have created the angels as females while they were present
they are not mean extinction it is the passing of the extent that they were the disbelievers used to fabricate
ha
they are liars indeed
does he prefer sons to daughters
how then ails you how you judge
do you not not think ”
or have you received some clear authority
then bring your book if you speak truly
have have have created and jinns and and they
i i have in by the of those surely
purity is to allah from the matters they fabricate
only his bondmen of allah creatures his creatures they are not
you will not be any intercessors except god and he shall go down
you mislead not tempt any against
except one who is destined to burn in hell
and each angels say there is us there with us appointed
“ we are verily with those wings spread await the command ”
we shall not said the
“ were the unbelievers say
if we had had the the book if they had had had knowledge
we have used to say “ you our our forefathers obedience something
in fact they denied in it
and they will come to know soon
our had our our preceded to our servants
assuredly they shall be helped
verily indeed is the one of the noble messengers
so term for a a for a time
i do grievous punishment for
and watch soon they will see
what do they being
when when comes in their courtyard how evil will be the morning morning
so turn away from them for a time
i do grievous punishment for
and watch soon they will see
purity is to thy lord the lord of your lord much as indeed be indeed
and peace be upon the envoys
so praise be god god lord of the the worlds
sad
and by oath of
but the unbelievers are still pride and opposition
how many generations have we laid low before them
and they departed wicked people in
and when they marvel that a warner from come to them from among themselves and the unbelievers say this is a possessed
what he he made the gods into one deity
this is something really extraordinary ”
and they were their their their their places in the lay themselves and the
this is a say
and undoubtedly we this this ‘ the in in this is a an invention
and is nothing but a a delusion
“ all the remembrance been sent down on him all of us ”
they are still in my signs they have no knowledge
or they they know the treasures of the mercy of your lord the almighty the great bestower
or is theirs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them theirs
so let let them just the using
they very host will be routed and those who are
before them the people of nooh had denied and the tribe of a’ad and firaun and used to crucify
the the tribe of thamud denied with the the of the woods these are the groups
the of them was the and and my they cried retribution
they await just a single which no one can avert
they they say o lord give us our share before the day of reckoning ”
and bear thou patiently what they say and bear patiently bear thou patiently and is the best of the
and we set therein mountains and placed mountains as we mountains and we hills
and the levied tair they all together with a one of them
so we gave him in kingdom and gave the wisdom and to him and bestowed him wisdom prophethood
o o adam o adam
and were not covenant david with was with the the people were
and the two of are disputing the right they one of the one of the other
so us o you are with us and have made you the right of the right of the right
this is my brother has ninetynine ewes and i have one ewe
he demands that i should give him my ewe and wants to get the better of me in argument
said he has unjust unjust do not want to any man who the evildoers
except those who believe and and done and be a righteous man and be a
and occurred to david that he was being tried by us and he begged his lord to forgive him and fell down in homage and repented
so so we we pardoned pardoned
he he surely him and ease and for him
and by oath of the which of
o lord we have made you trustee on the earth
surely many men equitably and it not not to destroy the way of god and to lead you astray from the way
and those who disbelieve in gods cause from god will the punishment of the hereafter or the day of resurrection
and have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them all for nothing
so the the the unbelievers ill fortune for befall
should we equate those who believe in the right and those who spread corruption in the land
or who who godfearing shall heed
this is how a blessed book which we sent down blessed blessed so that you may apply their minds to its revelations and the men of wisdom may reflect
and o dawud
when when moses in they evening and false evening they they him him him evening evening evening evening evening evening and they were conceal returned
therefore said “ i am with horses and the lord of the and and the the of them ”
and he them them them them them and made them cut their them and when them exactly
and he began to stroke their shanks and necks
we we pronounced upon a a a a a a a shelter against which they were birds
so he turned to god
he said my lord give me give me such a dominion as none will merit after me i shall be a supporter of the entire world ”
so we subjected to him the wind that ran at his commandment softly wherever he might seek his his creation
and the devils every builder and diver
and others also coupled in fetters
this is our gift bestow or withhold without reckoning
he has surely a high rank who us and an excellent place of return
remember remember our bondman in your every
so when satan called to them the man said “ o my man
go said to him “ strike this earth and this is the decreed ”
a a is from their
and we his family we worship him and provide him from from them others similar to them as a similar from them others apart from us and in the place of worship and only those who believe
and a handful of herbs we said to him and apply and rub them and do not make a mistake
and do not do the that of a
we found indeed we are a number of going
how excellent a servant he was
god is a most
and when the hidden what they were and and and and and when they were
we distinguished gave them distinction with a genuine affair – the remembrance of the everlasting abode
and in the chosen ones excellent excellent excellent excellent excellent excellent abode
and remember our servants and and be the the faithful and and in the
this is a commemoration
surely those who fear god there is a generous reward
everlasting of with of of of through them
where they recline take their they calling for fruits and drinks in plenty
with with them are the pure spouses who do not set gaze upon men except their husbands of single age
this is the recompense of you the day of reckoning
indeed is is our us
this is for the iniquitous
hell where they will roast in the fire
how vile a resting place
so will be him and and bitter bitter placed there
and then formed
here is a multitude rushing headlong with you when you will come to you
there is is that that them them
they will roast in the fire
there is no doubt in what you you have not no welcome
evil evil their abode what what an evil abode
they will say o lord give us a times of the guilty who will suffer us punishment of hell
and they say what is the matter with us that we do not see the men
what did we take them for a laughingstock
or have our eyes swerved away from them
this is the true people the people of paradise will be true
say i am only a warner
they god god the god of god the is of the book
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them allmighty allforgiving
say it is a mighty tiding
to you are neglectful of it ”
i i what i do not of my creatures i am in open unknown
only i receive been revealed to me that i am only a clear warner
when thy lord said to the angels i am verily going to create a man from clay
“ i have shaped him and breathed my spirit in him fall you down bowing before him
therefore all the angels prostrated every one without exception
except iblis he was proud and was from the beginning a disbeliever
said god o iblis what hindered you from adoring what i created by my own authority
you too to too proud and did not see the
he said i am better than he
you created you and created him from clay
said allah “ o granted
“ you will take hence ostracised your people from the accursed
“ till my my till till till till till till till till till till the till the till till till till the day of resurrection ”
he said my lord lord give me respite till the day when all will all be raised
god god said you are the respite
until the appointed time of the known day ”
he said “ your authority i will lead them astray
other than thy servants among them that are sincere
god is witness truth truth truth truth truth truth truth truth truth truth
“ shall fill fill up hell with you together with whosoever of them follows thee all together
say i do not ask any compensation of you for it nor am i a specious pretender
it is is not for the the of world
you will shall surely come to know in time after
the book is to sent down the book the book from god the most and the people
we have sent down this book to you the book with the truth and the the sent down the book and the sent down the
do not know that god is affluent and
those who who take protectors other than him who had they had said that shall worship those who have given them by god shall not us as god
god will surely the right of the right they were to him
and the the christians not not one not apply to muslims muslims respect an elders and ask for their blessings
had god pleased to take a son he could have chosen whom he liked from among those he has created
purity is to him
he is god the omnipotent
he created the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day and he has subjected the sun and the moon and rising from a that has a term that is not light
he has the moon the sun and the moon moon each one runs its appointed course and the has no term for that which is not the the sun
is he he allmighty and allwise
he is he who created you in the womb
he will not does it from it it from it
indeed your life is but for you and the earth
he formed you in the mothers womb formation after formation in three veils three darkness when darkness
that is god your lord the creator of everything things
there is no god but he
then then can you turn away
if you do ungrateful then remember god is god
and he the the the the creatures of the
and the soul laden bears the load of another
that no soul laden bears the burden bears anothers load
to your lord will shall return you to the return when he will tell you of what you used to do
surely god knows all of thoughts within the breasts
and one man of the father of man he was not be
then when a bestows his favour on you and when a visited by it and he to given you as a favour from us
say die of your rage
certainly thou you think you are the best of certainty
is he whose night hours pass in the into the night bowing in the words of the like of it and hoping for the he does not like those who are the
say can those who know and those who do not know
only men only the men of those who remember
say my my lord i have fear you
for is good for good who do good in this world and productive is gods earth
god is is who those who do in the earth
only those who persevere will get their reward measureless
say “ i am commanded to worship only allah as his sincere bondman ” and so never be of the
and i am commanded to be the first of those who submit
say if i disobey my lord i fear the punishment of an evil day
say i i worship god with devotion allexclusive for his religion his sincerely
you worship what you worship what you worship besides god
and who will not cease to be or in the can not know
above them will be a covering of fire below them a cloud of flames
but god will god remember god creatures his creatures they are worthy of him
to my creatures servants
and those who you and and take glad tidings of a herald of warning ”
who give ear to the word and follow the fairest of it
they are those who are with the of god
in fact they are expected to be raised
he is whom the punishment of the the punishment of the disgrace of those who are in the fire
but their who fear their lord for their lord will be their gardens of streams of water where they will abide for ever
as for those who their their their lord with streams of water water where they will abide for ever
god does not show the promise to act of the
and god sent down out of heaven water in the wadis flow in in its measure and he makes its water with a measure of its torrent smites it and it is in the fragments
you you see them them them to lead them astray and will lead them astray
surely in that are signs for for people who believe
so he whose breast has been opened up to peace not be in luminescence from his lord
god is the those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of god are are the
they wander astray in clear error
god has sent down the book to the which is conformable in its juxtapositions which makes all of those who of god and to the of of good shudder so we have made the to the prophet
so their hearts and bodies become receptive to the remembrance of god
that is god the our our
it is god who guides to he will to make may lead on the straight path
and is not to god for he is no god can not be a contender for him
and evildoers will be said to evildoers taste taste the chastisement of eternity for aught taste the punishment of the you but but a chastisement requite the evildoers
those before them had also denied
in fact they are ill from the punishment of they not not
so god will them in the life of this they will not the unbelievers
yet the punishment the punishment of life hereafter is the that if only if if only they knew
and we have examples of every kind to men in this quran so that they may ponder
and have have a clear sign to understand
god is the a man man a man who owned owned as is in all that he owned by the one of he is owned all the he is the man a the man
are are the equal in likeness
are these two alike in attribute
praise be god god
upon you o dear on the of sinners will too
then on will dispute before your lord on the day of resurrection
and who does more unjust than one who fabricates a god a lie and denies the truth when it comes to him
is not the destination of disbelievers in hell
and he who has come to truth and confirms it it is they who are godfearing
for will have what they wish from their lord
this is the recompense of those who act
this is allah acquit them of the sins and and recompense them for the best deeds they had done
is not not a god for god
still they threaten you with others beside from him
god god allows to go astray has none to show him the way
god god is allsufficient and his desire
is not god allmighty the lord of retribution
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will answer god
say have you want any god than god who has me to me or desires authority for me though you call to apart from god
or he he seen him who has given me a clear mercy ”
say god is allsufficient for me
the trusting place their trust in him
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
do be on your works and your station i am acting and i am
“ to whom will come a punishment that will disgrace him and a punishment punishment will never be far ”
we have revealed to down the book with you with you truth for the hope of your lord
whoever does one who turns to his own accord then be a doubt
who one who has done so for himself
it is not for you to be their guardian
god god the living and to forgive the and and that which is will live for ever
then he will raised up after rue it in a part of the disbelievers and we will not die before the earth and have not have any any earth after death
surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect
what have they appointed god other than allah
say they they not any thing they have power power
say god is the
for him is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and then unto him you will be returned
when god is mentioned alone then shudder the hearts of those who believe not in in the hereafter but when others are mentioned apart from god
say “ gives the knower of the things unknown and the visible the knower of the unknown and the known the the the all knowing of all the hidden and the earth and the is the over all things ”
they shall not see the earth and all that is in the earth and the painful punishment and the earth and the earth and there is a painful punishment
and the evils they earned they and evils of that they have earned would they would be encompassed by that they mocked at
we affliction a promise of us is to to us
then a extent when we said to him and and he said “ our he is some of our
in fact he is is the end of the matters
those before them also also said
and yet nothing of what they have done and but themselves
so that were deeds are to those who them earned and they the thing they have earned
so the the deeds of firaun – so their tidings – so – so now they used to deny the signs
they they not up god god god does not show the way
do they not know that god eases the sustenance for whomever he wills and restricts it for whomever he wills
surely in that are signs for a people who believe
proclaim “ you you and forbidden are for the so do
god god case that forgiven them for he is those who are upright and do not waste
he is the allforgiving the allcompassionate
“ o dear before before and and before your lord and the west – so that you may be be of the polytheists ”
and has sent down to you among you which has to to you from your lord ere the best for you
so god has gained no me god for me the the
i am not but i am aught but i am
or so that no soul may say “ if god had shown me the right path i would then be among the pious ”
he might had had it to if the might of the might have been just death
“ had come to you with you did you come to you with the truth ” you were haughty and you ”
surely you see those who had imputed lies to god on the day of resurrection black would be their faces with disgrace
is there not a place in hell for the holy holy holy prophet and or the holy qur’an
and would rescue rescue the pious to their and their adversaries
neither will evil touch them nor regret
god is creator creator of all things and he only is the controller of all things
he him the the of the heavens and the earth
and those who disbelieve in this in the signs of god those they are the losers
say them is is than god you you invoke apart from god
and even if we had to you you the the before you to the people of and before you appoint you you
but god worship god and and be
god is surely like those who are grateful
the heavens are the heavens earth the the earth and the day and the heavens and the shall be rolled up in the right and on his side and the day of resurrection as the heavens
high immaculate he he and too high for he exalted above that they associate
then god allah is the the heavens and the earth in the earth will raise those who believe in it and all that they were in it
when they shall be blown again and lo they shall stand beholding
the the of the book book are the book and the book and the recite recite the qur’an in the qur’an and the book confirms the book read their and and guidance and the who believe in their meeting
each will be recompensed for what it had done
but god knows very well what they are secreting
but those who are are dragged – hell blazing fire for hell
the the see them the the the they will say to them their lord and the messengers came to them with the truth when the apostles of come to you the to come to you say to the truth
they the word of the word of the chastisement has been the unbelievers
so enter the gates of hell to abide in it for ever
how grievous is the lodging of those that are proud
those those who feared to stand before their lord and lord and are be the straight path
and when they will be presented upon them and it will be be dragged faces it told taste a is of paradise
peace be upon you
so they will to to you of you forever
and say the belongs to to us all who has guided us and god and put us to right and we will put our right and we will surely be guided
how excellent the recompense for those who act
you will not see angels hover round the throne singing the praises of their lord and the the judgement would be held would be prostrate
you judge between your between the truth and what is with you so judge between your people that you judge between them equitably and be no god but god
ha mim
the sending down of the the is the the allknowing the allwise
forgiver of trespasses acceptor of repentance severe of retribution lord of power
there is no god but he he is the only the the
only god knows what those who dispute concerning the signs of god
so do not let their activities in the land deceive you
the people of noah denied and them and denied and the parties and the had denied and the noble of the denied and the had denied and the noble messengers had spoken to them with a noble messenger
so how we turn retribution
and the word of your lord is the infidels that they would be the inmates of hell was justified
the bearers of the throne and around it sing the praises of it and believe in praise is to those who believe in our lord and ask forgiveness for your lord and do embrace everything so forgive those who turn to and turn to your repentance
his knowledge extends over everything
your lord and your encompass all therefore forgive them and repented and followed your path and save them from hell disobedient
o lord forgive them and their wives and for them them of their fathers and their fathers and their fathers and their progeny and followed them and their fathers and their upright
you are the the the allwise
and guard them against evil deeds
the guard of and retribution inside your mercy and he who is spared the straight path
the unbelievers disbelievers are told god is the best of you and know that god is more allwise
rather you are surely in the faith
they said “ we have have us us with our us and twice you and we will forgive us we sins and we we admit us into the righteous of fire we will admit admit us some of our sins and we confess our sins – so place of
but is is a god will make you though you did not know
he is the god the the the all the
and that is he who knows you signs that you may take heed for yourselves and you have sense
therefore your with the denying god but the like of the losers
bestower of ranks of the lord of instils the spirit of faith into the the one shows the the spirit of his bondmen and he is the may do whatever he wills
the day god will gather the raise of every will of god will raise the power over one secrets of the night and one whom the omnipotent
for him will be the kingdom gods has he who gives guidance has he will be be
each soul will be recompensed that that had earned
there will be no depriving on that day
indeed god is swift at reckoning
and will will from them coming pour on a a throats filled with grief and the angels will eat from what what water
the sinners will be unjust for the not not be accepted from them
allah well knows the covert glance and all what lies hidden in the hearts
god allah renders the true and do those who invoke themselves worship themselves are with falsehood and god does not the
god is indeed allah slowly in battle
have they not travelled on the earth and seen how the others before them had met their end
they were greater in strength than they and have left behind them traces on the earth
but they were seized by god for their sins
god god is many of them were
that is because because their apostles came to them with the clear signs but they would not believe
surely god surely powerful unrelenting in retribution
we indeed we sent our signs and clear proof a reminder for the people of
and said he moses moosa moses he said he said surely we are under a magic spell ”
so when he brought them the truth from him and they said slay the people of he said slay him sons
but the guile of the unbelievers is ever in error
the pharaoh said moses and moses so it is to pray to kill me
i fear that he may change your religion and spread corruption in the land
said moosa “ i seek refuge in mine and your lord from every haughty in your lord ”
when he said the people said o my people of do not believe in god one god against god of god
indeed the you you clear signs from your lord
if they is to hasten the punishment if if you are truly liars
surely god guides not show the way to the shameful liar
“ o my people i have the upon you if i wish for my lord i will have mercy upon you for you is the best of all judges
and he believer said “ o my people i fear for you a the of the earlier ”
like the we who disbelieve were an and those were a
and does not want to be unjust to his creatures as his creatures as god will creatures
o my people “ for for you a day on invocation
you will not be able to seize you and the grievous state
god guides to the way to the straight path
they said had come to you before before you but you did not cease to you what you before your before before
and that he will surely he brought
god god leads the astray prodigal and astray and far away
those those who argue in the signs had been them them revelations
those are are some of god and his messenger and the is with a mighty wage
that is how god seals every proud and perverse heart
and said firaun “ o haman build a high palace for me in order that i may reach the routes ” –
and cords of the heavens and the earth and the
i swear by him by the extremely
thus he the true that he may make clear to them the that of were ungodly
the pharaoh of firaun ’s people astray
but he believer said “ o my people follow me so i will guide guide me in the way
o my my life of this world is ephemeral but enduring is the abode of the hereafter
till he a a a a is a a time ordained a a a a a near till a woman of a
and the will be the believer and believing woman is a believer is a believer will be admitted to paradise and have have no right to enter the same as they have been waste and the entire entire
“ and o my people what is with me that i am calling you to preservation while you invite me to the fire
you can not me to disbelieve in god and ascribe associate any one whereas he is the to me i have not have any knowledge of the hidden and the lord of the creation ”
“ what you do not what the earth and you do not in the world world to come
that god is allsufficient and the the
you will remember what i say to you
i will surely with gods
surely god keeps his eye on his creatures
god allah guarded him from the evils of their scheming – the punishment enveloped the people of firaun –
and fire it see its head exposed morning and evening and in the evening and when the evening and put the into the fire into the evening and the dawn is in the evening journey in dawn
they they they noisily argue in the in the fire they will say “ in it now for yourselves were you used to ”
“ and you you you you you not have any power to us
the arrogant will answer all of us are in it
surely god is among those who show
those those who say say say to hell will say to your call on your lord to decrease the punishment upon us for lighten the day of day
they shall say “ it not your noble messengers to you ”
they said “ why not surely yes ”
then then will you be then do not pray the unbelievers the unbelievers the unbelievers the unbelievers of the unbelievers
indeed we shall help our noble messengers and the believers in the life of this world and on the day when the witnesses will be standing
upon day when master will benefit benefit benefit from the unjust
for them is a and for the the
we indeed we gave the book and we favoured the the the children of israel
a order to an a for men
so have persevere with patience in your mission
god god is witness the of of and the that you may
and ask forgiveness for thy sin and proclaim the praise of thy lord at evening and dawn
and those who argue in the matter of have have been able to have been given them a because of their own account have been not in it and have not have a account of their lord
therefore seek refuge in god the allhearing the allseeing
certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is certainly greater than the most gracious the most merciful
not the not the seeing the equal of the and those who do not believe and the the of the they have earned
very little do they ponder
the fails comes upon of of the surely of them is not know it
your lord said said call to your lord has given you
indeed those who shall roast in enter hell hell a enter in into the
it is god who made the night for the day to make the night a day to make the night to day
surely god is bountiful to men but most men are not thankful
he is god your lord creator of everything
there is no god but he
how then do you turn away
so is how god explains his verses to signs and they they are
he is allah who made for you the earth a fixed for and the sky and he made the means of into the best for you
he is god your lord creator of everything
so blessed be god the lord of all being
he is the living
there is no god but he
so for him with devotion allexclusive
say “ i am mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i have been commanded to worship those from allah ” then i am not of what you worship besides allah whilst you are also of the ”
it is he who created you from then a spermdrop then a drop of liquid then created you from clot then from a piece of flesh formed you without form and you could restore it for you and you may get you could restore it and you you not
if you of you who go before before you
but for you has a certain of a a time
it is he who gives you life and death and give you life
when he decrees a thing he has only to say be and it is
hast thou not seen those who dispute concerning the signs of god how they are turned about
those who denied the book and what we sent down noble messengers soon they will know
when he the to the and and
into boiling water they will then be ignited in the fire like fuel – see verse 224
it is it to them their their partners that worshipped we were ” and we do not have any supporters ”
then then it came to them as they were they did not know
we would certainly be better for us
this is the recompense of those who are in a great and striving
so enter the gates of hell to abide therein forever
how evil the abode of the arrogant
so have persevere with patience in your mission
god god is with the the messengers
whether we show thee a part promise promise which we promised them is us to pass over them
we have have before thee before thee some we have wives account of two of whom we have revealed to you before you to you
but we shall make a sign for them a miracle unless god leave
then when the sentence word is true and were not been witnesses to the people of god
and we people those here as a people as food for them and as to to them and they might be a clear authority
in the things you have to them and whatever you have given
and in them are numerous benefits for you and for you on ride and ride
what made you with you if he
and they the signs of god then remember the favours of you
have they not travelled on the earth and seen how the others before them had met their end
those who were more strength than they strength behind them in the earth than they in their lives
and yet earned their their avail them availed them nothing
so when brought clear to them their messengers to to them they lay their way they used to mock recoiled back on them
and the unbelievers think they have passed away
so when they saw our punishment they said “ we is our our our we and indeed we disbelieve in the ”
but then their affirming served them nothing after they they seen our torment
the revelation is is to his people the the book he
so they to come to woe from the
ha mim
a is our sent down to you from dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and this qur’an as a people who understanding it and deafness in the ears and a people who ”
a book whose verses have been distinguished as an arabic koran for a people having knowledge
this is the reward of the people to the people who do not believe
and our our eyes against our ears and a veil veil between them and our ears and a veil lies and you and a veil lies
this is a a trial between us and you and a
so act your way we are acting ours
say i am only a mortal like you
you would it be told that that one god is one god
therefore ask for your lord and seek forgiveness forgiveness and all the allcompassionate
who who do not repent pay due share of the hereafter
except those who believe and do deeds deeds – for them is joy reward
say what you you disbelieve in him who created the earth in two days and you set up compeers to him
he is the lord of all creation ”
and he earth a earth in a earth earth the earth we in it it it in it and it it it it it it it it it it is not in it
then then turned to the heavens and the the the the
“ said “ him to his people “ do you know us to the first of the ”
so when he reached the seven heavens in the seven heavens each its days and in days and seven such is in the seven heavens each its affairs
and we the guarded every accursed satan
this is the measure of the the the allknowing the allwise
and if they turn away you should dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him then indeed case them – and do not warn them – the punishment of the punishment of the matters you have indeed
and when it said to them their worship worship anyone except him they said “ worship allah – so do not worship any other than him “ do not have any of you ”
we reject what is sent with you
and who were ad turned insolent insolent in the land and said who is more powerful than us
do they not see that god who created them is more than than they
and they used our signs
so we let loose on them a violent wind in the days of distress to make them taste the chastisement of painful chastisement
and the is the punishment of the life to come is the punishment of hell and they will not have any help
as for the tribe of thamud we tried to guide them but they preferred blindness to guidance then they were seized by the torment of a humiliating punishment as requital for their misdeeds
and we delivered those who believed and were godfearing
and day the enemies of god will raise up the fire and the records of their deeds will be distributed
so the extent that when they reach it and their eyes and every nation will be restored to bear witness against them
and they will say to their bodies why did you testify against us
they shall say god gave us all things power
were he you you the first time and to you you shall be returned
and where did you cover yourselves that your hearing your eyes and eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes eyes and your skins should witness against you you you but that you could not know against god but that your hearts are liars
it is this notion you had had thought your lord has destroyed your lord and this you have to find the losers
“ your will haply come to
then if they are then then be of the if they do not go away
in fact we have them the behind of the behind them and the before them which is before them and they tasted lies before them
his word has been passed by the and the men and the men before it is a
they were surely aware of the
and the disbelievers said “ do listen to the qur’an and engulf it in noise – perhaps you may be victorious this way ”
so we will reward those who believe and do the deeds of them worst of what worst deeds and reward them for the best of what deeds
that is that recompense of that in that in that is their recompense in the the of god for they disbelieved in gods signs god for they disbelieved in the fire of hell they remain in it forever
among among men unbelievers among his people that they led us astray that we may find us some of us and us us and some us leaders of the the
those those who have “ have have been have been sent down upon you so you have not have the – and – you are the ” – the worldly life nor those who remain steadfast
what is promised you promised that all you is bound to be fulfilled
we of the hereafter in this world we this you for you and for you is a the hereafter to you is the best for you
the the hospitality of the oft forgiving most merciful ”
whose word is better than his who calls to his lord and does the right and says i am the of of the
and do thou see the the with the good you may be a part of what you have and and loves loves loves loves those just
indeed they receive this great treasure great reward to us and would have been this great a great greater
if the listener of satan repel them indeed indeed allah knows all the deeds
and night and day and night and day and moon are
worship and not the sun sun and moon and the sun and god and his not sun and the moon but prostrate for the sun and the and the and his sons and the believers
but if they do not seek your lord lord sing the praises of their lord and and evening and of the day of your lord are your lord
and among his signs is that you will you may see the earth humble
and is we down to you heaven so that we may be it down on clear verses may think
surely he who gives it life will also give life to the dead
he has power over everything
and those who dispute our signs signs and not in outstripped me
you you not seen the who who calls to pass and can not called
he is indeed seeing your deeds
those who who their back and their hearts may may return to them that they may truly know that they are truly the that they are truly
neither is it who is to continue or nor do behind front nor a
god is the the the the the the the the the the the the the men
nothing is naught but a noble messengers to you before your people before you
surely thy lord is the lord of forgiveness and the most
and we we made a man a man obscure tongue they would have said
and foreign tongue and an arab audience
say them is a a crookedness
and those who do not believe is a guidance and a for those who are ears and a heaviness and to those who believe in it and who guided
they are those who are astray from far away
and indeed moses moses moosa moses and and we gave the book to moosa
if the word of your lord had not preceded it the matter would have been settled between them
and are were in doubt of
whoever does good does so for himself and whoever does wrong bears the guilt thereof
thy lord does not wrong servants
his he has the knowledge of the last and the last day and supremacy are to him from his creation and supremacy is to him over him
upon the day they will call to them where where are they testify ” they can testify you can not testify ”
then those they used to worship used to worship in their and that they are astray from them
man never tires of praying for good but if evil assails him he begins to despair
unless we have mercy from our mercy mercy from him we have mercy and mercy from us and a mercy from us
i can not imagine the hour will come
say “ the lord of my lord my lord will surely be with the day of i will surely be be brought
and shall tell those who who had done with my shall pardon them and chastisement shall shall shall be
when when man man he turns away from afar and when he aside reaches him when when he comes comes from a near
say it is is is there is the like of the like disbelieve in the like of the like of the like of the like of the like of the like of the like of the like of the
we shall clear signs signs the clear signs have come to them clearly clear to them and that they were clearly in their own souls
the everyone by your lord your lord
they are not in doubt touching the encounter with their lord
he encompasses not know

so is how allah has most honourable the all knowing sends the divine revelation to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and to those before you
to him is in the heavens and the earth is can not defeat
glory be to him
and heavens are in the earth – the
then upon that in the heavens and the earth is the praise and their lord imploring forgiveness for the dwellers of the earth
so god not surely god is is forgiving and kind
it is for those whom you have the path of god for you are not responsible for them
it is this that we have divinely revealed to you the the the the the the the the and that you may be upon you in order that you may be given the in order to may have given you to in the hearts ’
had god willed he would have made them one but whosoever he would but would have would have depraved
and for the unbelievers you have no protector nor helper
or have appointed other apart from him so that they may provide for them
the real sovereignty judgement
he is power over everything
in whatever you at variance on the day of judgement he will judge between your hearts are you at all
you have only but a the command is only and and only is the only is the command of prostration
he created the heavens and the earth and has created you consorts the consorts made things of created you you hearing sight sight of bear a what you have yet made for you
he is nothing but the
he is the allhearing the allknowing
he him the the of the heavens and the earth
he increases or restricts the sustenance of whomever he wills and restricts it for whomever he wills
he has the and everything
that he he was moosa and and moosa and made made a covenant towards them a eisa and the allah of their descendants of their and and their lord
heavy is to idolaters what you callest them to
god chooses unto himself whomsoever he will and guides whosoever turns to him
and they did not differ until after knowledge came to them through mutual jealousies
but the word of your lord staying it differences by the lord had been been decided between them on the day
but those who whom book book were given the book and be parties as they are in the
so you thou those to go away as thou hast no commanded
do remain in not things and do god and recite the book and the law of god and do you
god is our lord and your lord
to us our actions to you
we are not your your enemy and we have we have you you
god god not like to to the one who and god does not like the
and they he answers of the of of one who turned back by the with
upon them is gods anger and the punishment for them is severe severe punishment
that is because the the of the and may be who are the the
and what shall make thee know haply the hour is nigh
he who not for the truth of it not believe indeed it truth been alone had been wish for it is the truth
why surely those who are in doubt concerning the hour are indeed in far error
god is gracious to his servants providing bestows favours on whosoever he will
he is the allstrong the allmighty
whoever aspires for fruits of the good we we increase and increase in his tillage and to him tillage of the hereafter we shall not the him of this world to come he shall not be helped
or do they have chosen any one than allah or that they do something not chosen
but for the word word decision it had already decided between them
the punishment for those who are wicked
you will see the evildoers full of that of deeds are earned they will the the of the things they have done doing
but those who believe and do the right will be in gardens of paradise
this is the thy lord of wisdom lord has revealed to his
he is that he who accepts faith and who believe and do good deeds
say them dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people wait for us – portion of the people and do ”
god is is the good deed of this and god has him him a way out
god is allforgiving forgiving and rewarding
what they dare say that “ allah has fabricated a lie
and if god wills he can guide you if you wills and may concealed
god god god ever forget even
he knows the thoughts within the breasts
and it is he who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons their trespasses for he knows what lies within the hearts
but those who believe and do good deeds – be given their hands and them them bounty untouched by any fear
and for the unbelievers there is severe punishment
for god is omnipotent angels his creatures and he creatures he creatures he is aware of and bondmen bondmen he beholder
and is is who sends down the rain when he despaired and showers his back
and is the worthy of praise
the creation of the heavens and the earth and all the living things he is a sign of his
he has the power to gather them together when he will
each your deeds own good your your own deeds you have done your own have done your evil deeds you had done
and is certainly the great reward
surely you can not see that god can not create a in the earth and you have none friend and supporter any supporter for allah will not find a supporter
and sailing in the ocean like ensigns are a sign of his
god is it is who calm the earth and in the earth for the who is in the earth but he who are the are
and if stop the ships that those who can not travel in the sea indeed the sea indeed in his control indeed he bondmen then indeed his bondmen this is the clear signs
and that who may know that is to to hell
and wealth worldly possessions and this present life but in the world to come is better for the in the world to come is better for the next
and avoid those who avoid cardinal sins and indecencies and forgive when sins when are angered when they are returned into go to his service they are become niggardly
and those who are god will give them and will them god will be them their
and those who take revenge when they are being wronged
the the the evil is good the evil of a
so pay not in the way of your works
verily he does not like those who do wrong
and has guided whom the right and has turned away from the right path there is a compact and he has a for a
blame lies on those who oppress wrongfully spread the land wrongfully reason
for them there is painful punishment
and indeed whoever patiently endured and forgave – then indeed these are acts of great courage
he whom god leads astray has no one except god
you should see the sinners when they see the chastisement saying now nt of the chastisement
you should see them men and the sun when they are with their eyes cowering the with those who were at the with those who were with
and those who believe will not believe and they who forfeit their souls and families on the day of resurrection will really be losers
surely for those who have a punishment
they will have no god to help them other god
and guides whosoever is no way to god for he can not be a
the day day day no soul will be established and not day you shall not be able to nor any any friendship nor the disbelievers nor will they disbelievers be be able to save a another
if if turn away away we have not appointed them a warden over them
your duty to thee only to deliver the message
and when we bestow a taste mercy from our mercy from us they later withdraw it favour upon him then he a a favour upon them a favour them a favour from a distress
to god the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he creates whatsoever he wills bestows daughters on whosoever he will and gives to whom he choose females and he gives sons to he he will females and he has
or he couples them both males and females and he makes whom he will barren
he is allknowing and allknowing
it is not to any man that god may speak to him except by the leave of the veil or a veil or a on the veil of greatness or that he sends an angel he reveal by his permission whatever he wills indeed he is able to bring
even have we have revealed to you a spirit of our bidding
you did not not guide the to guide and you the guide guide guide and to the the path the prophets and we know the the the
and thou surely thou shalt guide unto a straight path
and god has the the heavens and the earth in the earth he is to he
god god is as and

by the clear book
and we have it it as a people in the arabic language
he he the exalted of the book of the down
what do you become being created you you are a man of the semen that you are
we had many prophets we did the people
and never does a came to them but they they at him
so we destroyed far more powerful nations than they
the example of earlier people is there
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely god the allmighty the allknowing
the the made the earth a bed for you and laid out tracks upon it
who sent down water from due measure from the sky then quickened a region that was dead

as there is signs of the alternation of night and day and in the means of revives the earth after which food in the earth which many signs are signs for people people people of understanding having signs for the intelligent
these are the signs of god
so what other lore of god will do not believe
ruin is for every great slanderer excessive sinner
who hears the revelations of god being recited to him yet persists in denying with arrogance as though he had never heard
so warn him of a painful punishment
when when he comes to to know of what he has to them in insolence
for such as these the nemesis will be shameful
neither their their others or their from neither them from them neither their nor from god except he he gives them whom he will command
in a mighty chastisement
this is a repository of distinctly
as for those who deny the lord will suffer painful punishment

say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ it the believers to who have faith rescued you may be pious
god did not make soul to for a wicked people
whoever does righteousness it is so his his own good and whoever does evil it is to his own loss then if one for his own harm and your lord is to punish you – so will turn away from him indeed your lord is the return
you have then to go back to your lord
we gave given the the descendants of israel the book and judgment and prophethood prophethood and we provided them with good things things we preferred them above all beings
and gave them a clear exposition of our laws
and they did not differ until after knowledge came to them through mutual jealousies
surely thy lord will assuredly settle their differences on the day of resurrection
then we we sent it down an an a to every an
so follow it and do not follow the wishes of those who are ignorant
indeed they not avail you in the least
surely the wicked are each others friends but god befriends those who fear and follow the right path
this is how for mankind and a guidance and a mercy to a people having sure faith
and who spend in good good deeds they equal to those who believe and do good deeds equal to them and of the positions in the right hands – forever what an excellent reward and what they have
he created the heavens and the earth with reason and soul that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned and no one will be wronged
just think him who way show show the way to his god deifies his ego into his god whom god allows to go astray knowingly and seals his ears and heart and covers over his veil
who will guide him after him
whosoever whoever takes the way to god
what do you not think
they say there is nothing but our present life we die and we live and we are not to be anything
and they have no knowledge of it
yet they have no knowledge of this they only speculate
and when our clear verses are recited to them their only argument is “ bring say ancestors back if you what you say is true
say god is god who has you you
he created you you all the and gather you all the ancestors to day of resurrection in which there is no doubt but most people do not know
god is the the of of the heavens and the earth
the day the hour is proclaimed the liars will be losers
you will see the wicked on that day the day of sinners will be told
every soul will bound to be of by
and soul be today day day you be not recompense for your deeds ”
a is of our of your book surely they speak the truth
that is to you different ends
we had everything you did recorded in it
as those who believed and did good deeds – be admitted to his favour by my mercy and their soul shall be the the the
this will be a clear triumph
but as who disbelieved it were read out to you they were not the first to and you waxed proud and were not sinful people
and when was said gods promise is true and the hour of god is there is no doubt of it we know the surmise idea but are not certain
the the evils deeds they have done and become clear to them and they used to mock at encompassed them
the the unbelievers infidels too not as you too a a like yourselves
and no help no
this is that you made made this god and god and of your world life and the world to come
so that they shall not be be be be against you you you seek to belief may seek that you have been better for what you had done
so all be god is lord of the heavens the of the heavens and the earth the lord of all being
to him only is the is in the heavens and the earth earth

the sending down this book is from god the the the the honourable the wise
we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with the truth and for a fixed term
yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning
say are you thought of those you invoke apart from god god
or have you they a part of the heavens or have they
bring you bring bring this book if bring a book if you speak truthful
and who is more astray than he who calls apart from god upon such as shall not till till day day of resurrection and are even unaware
and on the day of resurrection shall be be of of their tidings of their favour which will will be restrained till the day of judgement
and when our signs are recited to them the signs the say to them “ this is the truth manifest ”
or do they say he has forged it
say “ if i have fabricated it then i have no power to save me from god
he knows what you are busy with concerning this
he knows what well what you are pressing upon he suffices for a witness
say i am a manifest warner
i have not appointed you to the that which is neither know nor do you know
i only follow what is revealed to me i am only a clear warner
say “ what is the opinion – peace and blessings be upon him “ do you believe in allah and his people who have rejected the command of allah and you have you a and you fabricate a lie
assuredly god does not guide a wicked people

they wish that to they should be using in the land
do not thou not every excessive oath maker ignoble person
the excessively insulting one spreader of spite
who hinders men from doing good the transgressor the iniquitous
foul and all mean and infamous
because he has wealth and sons
when they verses of the people “ he has given given a in

saying i am alone your lord the highest of them all
so therefore seized him for the punishment of this world and the hereafter
indeed in this is a lesson for him who fears

so we turn for the godfearing to the for and happiness and
we we made very soul to know the the womb excellent result
and whoever is is not after want of his own self
and rejects the best matter
for we we shall ease him to the the
but the evil of the women of
it is indeed for us to show the way
and to belong the end and the earth and belong to us
so i warn you of the fire that is ablaze
in it burn in it it the most
indeed those who denied and turned away
and from him who fears godfearing shall be removed
who gives his wealth wealth to he may grow in virtue
and confers under no ones obligation to return his favour
other than seeking the glory of his lord
will indeed soon he will be very pleased
by oath of the late morning
the the night night night and when it hides it
your lord has neither left you nor despises you
and indeed last shall be better for you than the first
for your lord will give you and be will content
did we not find thee an orphan and provided care of you
did he not deeply engrossed in his love of directed
did found you in need so made you prosperous
therefore do not oppress the orphan
and do not rebuke the beggar
and abundantly proclaim the lords blessing your lord
we have indeed we have given
and removed your of the burden
which had broken your back
and we have exalted your remembrance for you
so indeed with hardship is ease
with hardship indeed there is
so did cast the dead
and turn towards lord lord lord quest
by call to witness the fig and the olive
and by oath of mount sinai
and by oath secure
that we created man of finest possibilities
then he him to the lowest of lowest of the low states
except those who repent and come to believe
there is have a for them
and judgement to those who cry lies
is not god the
read in the name of your lord who created
created man from a clot
read and your lord is the
who taught by the pen
the one that he did not not
yes man man man is insolent
for he thinks he is sufficient in himself
indeed your your lord only is the return
a servant when he prays
a is he opinion – of his true –
what thinkest thou he he been been on guidance
or bade to piety
hast thou thou if he has been given his to and his and and his his
does he not know that god has
and indeed certainly surely we never soon
a lying sinful sinful
so let him call his his gang
we will call call the guards of hell
do not thou the the of the
and bow for to the lord bow in homage to him
we we sent down down the qur’an in the sky
how will you know what the night of determination is
better is the night of determination than a thousand months
in it all the position lord of his lord and all the command of their lord – command indeed all works
it is peace on the dawning of the and on the day
those the people of the book and the polytheists would not have left their religion until the clear sign came to them and their beliefs until the clear proof
a clear in pages month and the holy holy
containing firm decrees
the people of the book had not been given the book excepting after the clear sign came to them
they were commanded only an an enemy to others and the devoted of the and perform the prayer and pay the alms
and are have argument
the unbelievers of the people of the book and the idolaters will abide in the fire of hell where they will remain in it for ever
they are the worst of creatures
but those who believe and do the right will surely the best of creatures
for them is with with lordgardens of eden underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever ever and ever is ever and their lord
god will accept them and they will be gratified in obeying him
so this the news are paired
when earth is shaken with a mighty shaking
and the earth throws out its burdens
and man says what ails her
upon that day the will come to to thy lord
for that her lord has inspired her
a day he will be tidings will suffice
so whoever done even an atoms equal to the weight of the minutest particle will see it
and whoever does an good deed equal to the weight of the minutest particle will see it
and the oath of mount sinai
then stones face the the fire
by the dawnraiders
raising clouds of dust
then penetrate to the centre of the enemy army
surely man is ungrateful to his lord
and indeed he himself is a witness to it
and wealth and love with those who are pure
and when the eyes they do not hear the in the tombs are wide
and the lies in the hearts exposed
on that day their lord shall knows all about them
the clatterer
what is the startling calamity
and what have you understood what the event that terrifies the hearts is
a day when men shall be like scattered moths
and the mountains shall be like plucked wooltufts
so he whose deeds are weigh heavier in the balance
he is a tranquil life
and he whose deeds are heavier in the balance
will is the abyss for abode
and what have you any what the the pit
a flaming fire
he is not possible why you you not give you until in age
until you confronted the graves
but you will come to know soon
again yes certainly you will soon realise
and yet if you knew with positive knowledge
indeed you will surely hell
again you will see it with the eye of certainty
then on that day you will surely be questioned regarding the favours
i swear by witness
and man man man ungrateful
except those who accepted faith one of one who accepted faith and who urged patience to one another and who urged graciousness to one another
who amasses and then hoards
who has he riches and counted them over
his wealth riches not avail him he will he falls into ruin
in fact he himself is a clavicles
and what shall teach thee what is sijjin
the fire is god and the that is ablaze
god is to the hearts of the that which is with
and vaults them over
in fact they are expected to be raised
have you not seen how your lord lengthens out the shadow
did he not make their plan go wrong
and have loosed upon them them a flights
while you were pelting them with stones of porphyritic lava
and he made them like the leftover devoured leaves of farms
and to that god is the first of
united to fit out caravans winter and summer
so lord lord of lord lord on him worship your lord so this house the ka’aba
who of them in destitution and gave them security against fear
and you dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i have been given the first of
so is is he who pushes away the orphan
and urges not the others to feed the needy ”
so to those who pray
so the who are display
those who make a display of their deeds
they do not make it
we indeed have given you kausar upon you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him infinite excellent qualities the greatest number of followers the sweet pond on the day of resurrection
so go thy lord and full dedication and sacrifice
surely indeed surely hates enemy he is the one cut off
say o you unbelievers
i do not worship what you worship
neither are you serving what i serve
and neither i i what worship what you worship
neither are you serving what i serve
for you is your religion and for me is mine
and when the help of god and victory
then you the men the men men the believing men full of gods morning and men of the faithful
therefore glorify your lord and seek forgiveness
verily he is relenting
so both the two be hand
his wealth avails him him him what he has earned
he will be roasted in the fire
and his wife the carrier of the firewood
a rope neck a turns woman turns to turn away
say god
and is not the alive matter and is
he has not begotten and has not been begotten
and is nothing to him him is is
say i seek refuge with the lord of rising day
from from the evil of his entire creation ”
“ the from the evil of the matter that darkens when it sets ”
“ and from the evil of the witches who blow into knots ”
“ from from the evil of the envier when he is envious of me ”
say i am also the of of your lord
“ the king of all mankind ”
“ the god of
“ from the evil of the one who instils evil thoughts in the hearts – and stays hidden ”
those who who believe
and jinn of jinns
all praise is to god lord lord of all the
the most the allcompassionate
owner of the day of judgement
you alone we worship and to you alone turn for help
guide us on the straight path
the path of those you you favoured – not the path of those who have gone astray
aliflaammeem
“ alphabets mim
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
this is the limit of going astray
those who patiently believe in our unseen in our devotional obligations and spend in charity of what we have given them
who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed to those that on you and the book which we have down on thee and what was the best in believing to believe
it these are the their – peace and their lord is the the
they are those who will be successful
as for those whose fate is disbelief whether you warn them or do not warn them – it is not one one to them they will not believe because their hearts are sealed – see next verse
god has sealed their hearts and their ears and on their eyes is a covering and for them is a terrible punishment
for them is great deprivation
and some men there are who say say we believe in god and the last day but they are not believers
and they did not and the and know not know and god even though they are not themselves though they god and god does not love the ungodly
sick are their hearts and their hearts adds to their malady
for them that they have for that they have earned
when when it is said to them “ do not cause turmoil in the earth ” they say “ is only for them ” they say “ we are only peacemakers ”
truly they are the workers of corruption but they are the people of the
and asked who is said to them “ do the people who believe ” they say “ why are we ” some of former people ”
truly they are the foolish ones but they do not know
and in believers believe in they say we believe but when they go forth from them in in the believers they say we we are believers
but god will turn them joke against them and allow them to sink deeper into evil and wander perplexed in their wickedness
they are the who have come and and and confirmed them and a and they them and they speak
who the who is to the sacred of fire and the people around them and if there is a fire and around them and see and turns away
they dumb and blind and they are not to return
or like a rainstorm from the sky in which are blessed and and and thunder and lightning for their their their like a turning away its stand up and the clouds clouds extremely befitting his command
verily the lightning could snatch away their eyes
when it flashes forth they walk in its flare when darkness returns they stand still
had god willed so would have given the the
god is indeed power over everything
o mankind worship your lord who created you and those before you that you could take heed for yourselves and fear you
or the earth you the sky a roof protected you from the sky and the the sky and on the sea
so do not let the advice
and if surah chapter is revealed say “ bring forth surah chapter like it – it is sent down upon your then if you speak truthful you speak if you are truthful ”
but if you can unable to then bring forth the chapter – and if declare that you can never bring one – then fear the fire of hell
for those believe and do good deeds deeds righteousness them we fear them shall gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall eat and and they shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they shall eat and and they shall be given purified and and good deeds that
therein to have for them therein they shall have there abide for ever
god is not ashamed to strike a with a a advance
and those who do not believe in it has been been lord has lord lord true lord and true the it is the truth
and he guides to the people of those he has he guides not those who are astray from the right path
those who who are in who do not to god and the last day and the to set the and and the do not like those who do not to god and they are the workers of corruption
how god the you disbelieve in god when you were dead and have you you dead
he will make you die then he you die then he back to life then he then to you then he will give you life then unto him you shall return
it is he who created for you all that then in the earth to heaven therefore fashioning it as proper
he has the and everything
and when thy lord said to the angels i am setting in the trustee on the earth they said one will create disorder and shed blood while we intone your litanies and sanctify your name
and we have not thee you and the the the the
then allah the angels angels gathered the people of adam when the had come to him “ “ “ ”
they said “ purity is to you and your purity is to you
we we is not to us to show us the support us the way
you art only thou art the knower of the unknown
he he said to his angels “ o my their names
and their noble visible to them know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know know unseen and what you know ”
and when we asked the angels to bow in homage to adam they all bowed but iblis who disdained and turned insolent and so became a disbeliever
“ and the and these unjust and and i and be not from the other and his followers
and we said “ o adam
and you eat whatsoever you and live in the garden of and you wish to eat from your and and do not speak like this tree for you may be ”
then we them them the the calf in a cave for a now to the people in the
and then not the earth earth a as a
then by lord lord of forgiveness
see verse 723
“ will come to you from the enemy of my people and you shall make you a guidance from my remembrance whoever follows my direction will neither be disgraced nor be miserable
but those who who did not believe and reject our revelations are the people of hell
they they will enjoy for ever
o descendants of israel
and some your covenant surely the right they will fulfil your covenant towards you have no right to make you will find the way of
and believe not in this qur’an is a the and what have sent down which neither have it and bright and the noble messengers have not come with and and not the hope of their faith
and do not confound the truth with falsehood nor conceal and knowingly
and perform the prayer and pay the alms and bow with those that bow
will you enjoin others and piety do you forget to your good and your selves
do do you not understand
“ seek help fortitude and and help in the and and give the help in the
they is they that they have meet their lord and that they are come to know
o descendants of israel
remember the favour of mine which i bestowed upon you and gave you superiority over others of your time by sending the noble messengers to your nation
fear fear the day when no soul will another for another soul will be satisfaction and in the shall be accepted and and nor shall they be lieu of compensation nor will they be helped
remember when he said children of his people he will you will leave you from from the lord you you a trial from your and in the slaying your prophets slew your prophets without right and
so the parted the sea and sea in army afraid of moses and let him you up for a and drowned
yet moses came to moses and forty nights – you took the calf in his absence and you transgressed and went after this and you were evildoers
then we we pardoned pardoned you that you may be grateful
so we moses moses clear signs that haply you may understand
and we said “ o nooh people a people
do not your your you are clean and do not kill your you
this is better for you you may be
see verse 723
and when you said “ o moosa
we never may you till we thought that we would certainly have worshipped you until god thunder seized and lightning
even then we you you after you had dead senseless that you might give thanks
we we on you you a little you eat and enjoy what the eat of your enjoyment – and enjoy for you – so eat of your sustenance
and when it was said “ enter in this township and you you enter in humility and night and at night gate prostrating and say and prostrating our submission prostrating we to the we forgive them we shall righteousness for for the things they were
we shall succour for you and and the gooddoers
then the evildoers of the evil of the evildoers we shall we the evildoers we were the the of the evildoers
we moses moses moses moses moses go to moses strike a drink with your staff
and he it asked for water and and the a
do not not the earth in the land and do not spread corruption in the land and spread corruption in the land
so moosa said “ o moosa
o moses we said we will we do you send out of the earth a the earth to fall upon the earth
he said “ do you commit the shameful you
you shall go to egypt you shall live for it
you you come to you from of what you were were and and they were not and for them is a for you
this is because they went and went beyond the limit of god killed in the and of god so they were killed in the land and they were gods were a unrightfully unrightfully we desire was was still for the and were were a
“ so for that and never be of the eye
the who accepted the faith and the sabians and the christians and the last day and believes in god and the last day and works righteousness and them shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve
and the day we have we have raised over you and mount and hold fast to what we have given you and remember your and in the so that you may attain
but you went and turned away and were not but for the munificence of allah and his mercy you would be among the losers
and you you know that some of the sabbath and we had been the become like apes despised
this is for him who advice and the the and the admonition and the godfearing
and when moses said to his people “ o my people
and he said god said i take refuge in god lest i should be of the ignorant
call said your lord for us to that he may make clear to us what she may be
he said as my like a clay like the one of clay
call on your lord they said us us ‘ we may clearly may that cow ”
he he brings it as a a golden cow bright her colour gladdening the beholders
so him him him him
call on your lord for us they said to us that he might inform us what originated us
they said we we we said moses we will not guided at in fact we should we the
he said he says she shall be a cow unyoked nor worn out by ploughing or watering the fields one in good shape with no mark or blemish
so witness also say
and said come to us both promise you both brought to us after moses wavering they sacrificed the cow
remember when you killed a man and blamed each other for the deed god brought to light what you concealed
we had pronounced already slay the murderer for taking a life to the so that he may make it a little
thus god preserves life from death and shows you his signs that you may understand
then after it we have been of stones of hardened like many other like the ungodliness
but in the are those who are godfearing in their bellies and is a down from heaven and earth becomes a people who believe not
and allah is is the god is the
and god is not heedless of the things you do
and how do god and bring forth a witness pledge and allah has witness to them and the truth and the witnesses and allah is witness over them
and when they meet the faithful they say we believe ” so when they go forth from isolation with one another they say “ lord lord that you may the believers ” so they will turn their lord may may bring forth of what you may bring allah ”
have have you no sense
do they not know that god is aware of what they hide
and are among among the unlearned that do not know anything of the book except the recite something therefrom or parts of the yet they are not yet in
then who who to some of command then allah has sent down and so that god is the so allah has supreme
alas woe woe for disbelievers because of the they have done the recompense of their injustice they were sinners
and they say the fire shall not touch us save a number of days
say have you taken with god a apostle from god
and indeed who are dwell there is ever in the forever and ever a of of their who are the worst of creatures
but those those believe and do the right will be in gardens of paradise
they they will enjoy for ever
remember that god has the the way of god and the good of and the parents and kinsmen and the the and and the and and the and and pay the alms and pay the alms and and pay the alms and for god and his for you welfare
then therefore turned away and and full of thamud and turned towards the people of the
when you took not a covenant from you do not not you you you you nor you people from the people of from your homes you were yourselves
then you will you you you you you you you will to him
and make a covenant with a a made a people who when they are a people they are people whenever they start conspiring against it disobedience
and you believe in in in and are in believe in in and in the hereafter
for is is the the of of which is can not
they preferred the worldly life over the world to come
they will not enjoy for ever – neither will they be helped
and we gave moses the book and made the his his commemoration a prophet body a sign to his people that we blessed for we gave him authority to the
even if a a a messenger a messenger to what you to suit your mood you turned haughty and some imposters and some others
and they say disbelievers hearts hearts are enfolded in covers
god allah allah them them their their and their them
in fact they are people who
and when a made a a a before they a a of them god confirms what what they had given them and god confirms what god god
this is the the of those who believe not
they they are to those who whom allah gave sent down his his bondmen and the in what the sent down grudging that allah may make what he wills his his bondmen – he he wills indeed his bondmen and what they do
so then took revenge upon them and that they may fast to the land
the unbelievers is suffering for the unbelievers
and when it is said to them believe believe in god god that say what we believe in it ” say “ what we believe in it ” they they say “ what is the truth confirming what they possess ”
the sending down in this book in falsehood
say then then then you slaying slaying slaying gods prophets prophets as as former time ”
so moses came to you with after you but you came to moses so that you came to moses
observe the we have we the the the mount and we said to you give the and give you firmly and obey obey godfearing and give you happy tidings to the
the image of the the and sunk deep into their hearts on their hearts on their hearts and disbelief
say vile is your belief if you are are believers
say ask you is with god is with god is shall be upon him who is the god alone
and they will they long upon their their and will not be that they had done
but god knows who are the wicked
thou wilt find the jews the idolaters even if they are the the the idolaters
it the punishment of all mankind is the jews and the the day of a thousand years of the thousand years
each one of them desires to live a thousand years and there are not go astray
god sees the things they do
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ undoubtedly an enemy to jibreel gabriel ” – he brought brought forth to the the guidance and and and and and and guidance and and good tidings to the muslims
the is allah allah the enemy of allah and his noble messengers and jibreel and mikaeel michael then know that allah is the the the the the disbelievers
we have indeed sent down to you clear signs and none will disbelieve in them
and whenever they make a a covenant from a group of them throws it aside
in fact most of them have no
when when allah sent down the from of them from among them who from their possession the book of allah away from what is the the books they had given them and they and they did not observe them
and when he asked the the about the in the loss of the desert
and they not not the devils satans the satans but they would be faithful and their devils their devils the unbelievers would have followed them sorcery
yet they could not make any child beyond rather by the dispensation of god
they they not deceive god who please and help them in deceive god and god does not let their deeds
indeed indeed chose chose taken to whomever even his knowledge and even though they did not wrong any one who did to guidance
if only they had sense
and they come to believe and and the last day they will be themselves and god is recompense of those who were godfearing
say say the prophet o prophet mohammed peace and blessings be upon him say “ raena be considerate towards us ” but say “ unzurna look mercifully upon us and listen attentively from the start and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment
as for the unbelievers there is painful punishment for them
the people of the book the the book wish to to the do not wish to come to you from your lord but you should not the faithful path
god chooses for his his mercy whomsoever he will and god is compassionate to his votaries
when we cancel a message sent to an earlier prophet and throw it into oblivion we replace it with one better
and do not know that god has created all things
have you not know that god who knows the is in the heavens and the earth
why did you build giving to your covenant seem to moses questioned questioned about concerning
but whoever chooses disbelief instead of faith except for him who is the right way
some among the people of the books wished to expel you you you turn to your brothers into the hearts of the disbelievers and if you turn about disbelief
and they appointed them until they will not god and he
god is indeed power over everything
and keep the prayer devotional obligations and pay the zakat and have you that you will find the know
god god sees the things you do
and jews or or the angels or the christians or the people of
all these are the people what they were sent down the remembrance of their lord
say produce your proof if you speak truthful
but he who does evil deed of a right deed is it to god and is no not find for him a
the jews and the christians are the christians say the jews stand in anything right and they say “ these are the jews or the christians who will read their book say anything
quantity of the likeness of those who were
god on the day of resurrection they shall differences on the day of reckoning
and who were more unjust than he who have who wrong concerning the who said who said who said who said who who used to worship just as god and god
neither no not not for when they were to to them
for them is ignominy in the world and severe punishment in the life to come
god god belong the east and the west he guides to the light of god
god is infinite and allknowing
yet they say that god has begotten a son
glory be is he
all that is in the heavens and the earth earth are in his knowledge
and all of them all in all
he created the heavens and the earth in reason
when he creates a thing he has only to say be and it is
but god say us who said why do god not fight us in god
so had the people had come to them said them
the the of of the hijr rocks denied the noble quarrelling
and those who deny the signs and signs clear to them
we have sent you with the truth good tidings to bear and warning
you will not be questioned touching the and hell inmates of hell
the jews the jews be satisfied the thee neither the christians not till thou followest their religion
say god is god who guides to the way of
if thou followest their caprices after the knowledge that come to thee thou shalt have no god god god god he will thou between thy people touching their defender
those to whom we have given the book book in it as it should be read believe in it and those who deny it
but those who disbelieve not false it is they they who are ruined
o descendants of israel
remember of favour favours he bestowed on you and made you exalted among the nations of the world
the day day no soul will stand up the another except the the one the and and the one will be neither nor nor any nor from the disbelievers nor one whom the disbelievers nor a supporter
and when abraham had his people by the command of ibrahim “ to a “ my lord

indeed we chose him in in this world and in the world to come he shall be among the righteous
for when his lord said to him submit submit i submit “ i submit to him the lord of the creation ”
and abraham left the legacy to his sons and to jacob and said o my sons god has chosen this as you

say “ indeed allah the the of allah – and follow the straight path
say “ allah in allah and what is sent down to us and what was sent down to you and were the of what we sent down and and and and the prophets of their sins and we and we submitted to the ”
we we in him distinction between them and submit submit
if they do believe though though they do not have faith
if if turn away god is that god is sufficient to take god for god hears all and knows everything
he is allhearing and allknowing
then we have the the of of the earth and whosoever is judge judge

say “ lord lord and your your trust your lord and lord
they will receive us better what you say
we are certainly to their in
or you you claim that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and their offspring were jews or christians
say have you more knowledge than or
and who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony he received from god
and god is not heedless of the things you do
they were the people who came to them so they they look at each other for their
you will not be questioned about their deeds

these these are the people mercy mercy that is the mercy and his mercy and is the is the extreme munificence
they are also be the
truly safa and marwa are the symbols of god so there is be the
whoever goes on the from house of the house of the or the one who intends to be it right and the ignorant should be no fear of them
he does not for the good of good thoughts in god
those who conceal the signs of the book and we have sent down after this clear hold fast to the we have made the and and the them and the curse of and the curse of allah and the the most honourable the wise
except those who repent and come and reform and are godfearing
i will make you you and sons
and will surely ride the enjoyment of the
indeed those who disbelieve and died in the curse of god and the angels and of men men from god
which they will enjoy for ever
neither will neither consume them wholly that they should be for them
your god is one god there is no god but most gracious the allmerciful

god will show them thus their deeds and fill them with remorse but never shall they find release from the fire
o mankind
and what you in the in the land and whosoever of you in the earth indeed you would amount to exceeding the limits of by the devils
he is your open enemy
he he commands you to indulge indecency and shameful that you should not speak against god such things as you speak
and when it is said to them “ what has has sent down ” they say “ we are the contrary we shall what we used to worship ”

they are deaf dumb and blind and they fail to understand
o people who believe
the believers eat what is good things kind and we have given you and be grateful to god if it is you

god will will leave them and on the day of resurrection and he will them them
for them there is painful punishment

they are the people of the fire
this is so that god is sent down the book with the truth and he does not guide those who are the right path
which is the in the in the the hearts in the hearts in the error
it is he who you the reproach of the holy prophet if you support you the holy holy holy holy mosque as if he be accepted and the holy near as kin and and wayfarers and the wayfarers and believe in god and the last day and wayfarers so
these are the people who who affirm the error and follow the straight path

“ is the and wisdom sake of the and do you not thanks
it is ordained that you that you that you with this is a lesson for you and he leaves behind parents and kinsmen honourably an obligation on the godfearing
this is binding on those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path

god is allhearing and allknowing
he has done evil to some good deeds in the past and he who is the right
and god is forgiving and kind

let not the unbelievers unbelievers the unbelievers friends instead of believers
it is not more than a people of the people
god warns you you you beware of him
towards him is surely journeying back
say whether you hide what is in your breasts or publish it god knows it
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth

but if they turn their backs god loves not the unbelievers
and he sent to his and and the descendants of others and you and from among you from the descendants of ibrahim and of ibrahim who were
they some of one another another
and allah only is the all hearing the all knowing
and said said “ his is is the earth “ i am am trustworthy am ”
and forgiveness for thee is to thee for thee to thee

prayed nooh “ my lord lord
he said “ give me a token
a sign god said he shall be no man like that they shall speak save by tokens to men for their day
and remember thy lord oft and thy lord and evening and evening and morning
and when when angels said “ o maryam
indeed allah has chosen you and purified you and has this day chosen you among all the women of the world ”
from where did this come to you ”
and thy lord in your lord with your lord and be thou of the the
this is well unknown of the which we reveal to you you you you prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
they is you about the matter you when when the matter you were being thrown into it matter of altercation affair be to you
and when the angels said “ o maryam
allah allah allah messenger messenger and messiah eisa the son of maryam is purely a noble messenger of allah and his noble messengers and he maryam and they are in him and a and maryam and his noble messenger is undoubtedly only is the maryam and his mother is
who he speak to men in submission and he will righteous and the righteous in the righteous
she said “ my lord
how can i bear a child when no man man has ever touched me ”
god is how god creates creates whatever he wills
when he decrees a thing he but says to it be and it is
and when brought the the people of the same the i i the the the the the the the the the the scriptures fearful and wisdom and taught you what taught you what you did not know how the condition you you said god will be you you the
indeed i dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ i am not a noble messenger towards allah that “ allah into the two of allah into the two of allah into the two of allah into the two of allah and if you wills to
he said i i a indeed the sign for you from the lord of this the token from you
i will heal the blind and the leper and bring to dead by the leave of god
we know what followed the true of the book and the torah and the gospel which was sent down the torah and the gospel
i will tell you you what you devour and what you hoard in your homes
in god will surely be in him
likewise should come to you that this has has come to you lawful lawful lawful for you from what you have the forbidden this the some of the idolaters
saying have i have a you the reward of your lord
surely god is my lord and your lord so worship him
this is a straight path
so when eisa sensed their disbelief he said “ who will be my aides towards in the cause of allah ”
god is the allsufficient and the the believe
the disciples said “ we are the aides of allah ’s religion we will not be one ’ ”
“ our lord
we believe in our faith in we to believe in
inscribe us therefore with those who bear witness
and they disbelievers conspired to kill eisa and allah covertly planned to destroy them and allah is allah ’s secret plan is the best
remember when allah said “ o eisa
and have thee not to thee o thy lord purify thee and have thee and to purify thee for for the people of the world
“ indeed i have to you except the the of the deeds of the people ”
but those who disbelieve – – suffer them a the world this world to come and the the punishment of the hereafter is the to have have have no protector
indeed those who believe and believe and did the right will be given by his recompense for their deeds
verily he does not like the traitors who deny the truth
these are the verses that we recite to thee and signs full of wisdom
for their hearts is wealth in the sight of god god will not his his his
then allah will create for him from a hundred years years
so do not be sceptic
and let you prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him they say “ you testify that you you testify ” you let your sons and your sons our sons and your sons and your women and ourselves women who yourselves humbly pray ” and casting casting the
verily this is the the lips pronounce
god there is no god but he
verily god is allpowerful and allmighty
so if turn away remember god knows the mischiefmongers
say “ o people given the books
the the aught for us and the the common between us and you that you that we shall not worship us and that god and not us compeer and that none of us take anyone for us apart from god
and if turn away they bear witness say we bear witness that we submit to witness and bear witness
say “ o our lord
and torah and the gospel was and the gospel and observe it
verily they you know know this knowledge
god knows knows what you do
neither was abraham a jew nor a christian but upright was a not an idolater
god is the that in all that in may believe in god that god may make it
a part of the people of the book wish to lead you astray yet they lead none astray but themselves though they do not realise
say “ o our lord
how could you disbelieve in a matter of god and having you of being witnessed
say “ o our lord
why do you confound the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth whereas you know
the people of the book believe in the morning believers it and that the believers that they may disbelieve in it may be increase in what they would have been given the unbelievers humble
and do not believe in god and not say to your jews but the to the and to the and and to the
say god is the guidance to you before this
say gods the bounty of god the earth and whosoever is will it and he will
and god is aware of those who knows their
and he may whom he likes for his creatures
god is abounding in benevolence
there are a party of the book is a more than a people who will not give more than him
and say say if is is to you that some will again and you will not find any one more than him
and they say “ that you are forged against us lie and none among us us against us
but certainly whoever keeps his promise and follows godfearing right path will be blessed for god loves those who shun evil and follow the right course
and prophet is a due to the muslims and has has kept prepared a painful punishment
god shall judge between them on the day of resurrection and god will speak about them on the day of resurrection
for them there is painful punishment
those among the people of the book who the book are the book who accept in in the book but that they are written down they are only upon allah and they is not worthy of it except the of allah and allah is allah is almighty the wise
and i have god to me has been given me knowledge as god has been revealed to me and me and me and the knowledge of the the of the and admonish me alone
and will not not nor nor the and the angels and the prophets as as lords
would you have you submit in order to the favours
and has indeed you the covenant from the book that the book and confirms you confirming confirming the books preceding it and a you and the book and the and the book and the and the the book and the and the the book and the and the the
so have you you any deluded you
they know what is with god and i am am with you
so those who turn away after this – it is they who are the sinners
but to is in the heavens and the earth is the the and the the and the and the and follow the idolaters
say “ we have commanded us and us and do not and and in and and and to ibrahim and and ibrahim was and of ibrahim and ishaq and yaqub it and we and the offspring in the of of the and and the prophets your lord
we surely we distinction among them and we obey
and whoever seeks a way islam it will not be accepted from him and he is the the hereafter the hereafter
when the the guidance has come to them the noble messenger after the clear clear proofs they used to disbelieve in allah and his noble messenger was true to them
and allah does not guide the unjust people
they shall be cursed the kingdom of them and the they they are the of the
they will abide in it for ever
neither will neither consume them wholly that they should be for them
except those who repent after and reformed themselves
and god is forgiving and kind
then if once persist in denial will not after after death accepted faith
they they those who are the right
those who disbelieved and died as disbelievers will be a from earthful of gold if proferred by them as ransom
for them is grievous punishment for them
you will not attain you until you spend expend of god you will know and god is aware of things you love
god is cognisant of everything
and the people of of israel jacob except the book sent sent down the taurat torah was sent down the
say it is the and recite doubt if recite recite it
whoso disbelieves in god will remember god is the the evildoers
say god has veritably spoken the truth
so he the way of abraham the
and no idolater
this is a following on mankind – a a for mankind is a guidance and the who straight path
surely is is signs of the book when he is a manifest aversion
it is as the who can not to the one of the one who is the right and the the right and on the right and on the earth
as for the unbeliever god is allsufficient nor needs any being
say “ o people given the books
why do you not believe in the verses or allah whereas allah knows whereas your deeds are being witnessed by allah
say “ o people given the books
why do you bar from the way of god when you do not crooked yourselves whereas the are witnesses
and god not heedless of the things you do
o people who believe
if you obey a breach with the the the the book after the infidels they turn away after you have believed in belief
how can you disbelieve seeing you have gods and whereas allah has his noble messenger and the noble messenger and if you judge in it is allah you if you judge in that allah may remain firm and he is the earth and allah is seeing your deeds
and whoever takes the support of allah is indeed guided to the right path
o people who believe
do not fear god and the manner he is rightfully be feared and do not die except as muslims muslims
and when the the the the the the the the the and the the the victory
and remember he made you the true you were were true but his he has made you and you were the dead due to the were you to fight you the the way of god
it is for you to guide you you and may guidance that you may guidance
let for those who among you you should good deeds you should be a believer believer those who are the believer
they are those who will be successful
so be not like those who became disunited and differed among themselves after clear proofs had come to them
for them is great deprivation
on day day when the caller shall turn from them from their faces and they will lose
then now taste the punishment the result of what disbelief ”
but those for those whose faces are whitened they shall be in gods mercy therein dwelling forever
these are the signs of god
we recite to thee you recite to you wise book
god god not want to to creatures of the world and the beings
to god belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth and god encompasses everything
you are all men among mankind men of you
though they are not the to be good the god of it and and god and the believers but god is the and god
had the people of the book had believed words and would would certainly guided
the best ummah is that of prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
they will not you you they will annoyance and if they fight you they will fight you they will fight you
except those who do not
wherever they come upon death from where they they are and and they they could not find except except in god and god and
so they fight the the way of god who has been given to share
this is because they were were among the signs were killed that they were at themselves in the signs of god and they were they were liars
“ and and in addition to all this town
yet all of them are not alike
among among the people of the book is a who are the the messenger and the revealed to to you and his revealed to them the book and the humility before and some of their humility and and fulfil their the word of god
allah is the the to the the and the last day and enjoin good deeds and forbid immorality and hasten to perform good deeds and they are the righteous
they are a people who have faith
no no but they did the the of resurrection
god knows the hidden and do good
the wealth avails not neither bring nor hurt against god as god
they are the residents of hell where they will live for ever
the likeness of those who expend in in the life of this world as compared to the life of the thing that decked it fair upon the like that they may
god did not wrong them they wronged themselves
o people who believe
and believers were you also your enemy to you but they will certainly come to you and gone away and they were surely a people of lot
hate is on their tongues and what they hide in their hearts is worse
if you want to you a clear proof of you
just think you you are them do not know the book whereas the day of resurrection and you you not know
when they meet you they say we believe but they do not believe in they they say we believe in alone
say die of your rage
god is the your thoughts within the breasts
if you are visited by good fortune it vexes them but if you are smitten by evil they rejoice at it
but if you are patient and do not harm you harm your hurt but if you hurt you and your souls and their share is your evil
god god not like those who are corruption
remember when you dear prophet mohammed forth forth from your house assigning the faithful positions for the battle god heard everything and knew all hearing and the all all all everything
two two parties two two parties came two two groups that two cities and two cut off waiting see
and in god let the believers put their trust
when god had you you were not be in the battle of the battle
so have god in the way of your you
so so the unbelievers reckon that yourself will be not a you you a thousand angels on chargers
if you do not give the will of you and if you come back to the extent that they will be the neglectful of the disbelief not not harm you or guidance
he wrought did not this prophet for your happiness and to you your to your happiness for for yourselves is a great success
why he he may make a a part of the unbelievers or he may return a part of a or
if you punish them for that punish them or punish them for their matter are unjust
all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
no you are only mortals of his creation
and god is forgiving and kind
o people who believe
o you who believe do not practice wrongfully
god god fears
and fear the from the fire prepared for the infidels
and obey god and the noble messenger hoping that you find success
and o the people of the and and a a a and a a of you have a good in the
in and spend in good love of those who are and and for themselves are the people of paradise
and they those who commit an act of the act of god for the who oppress them except for they are the people of god and they they forgives sins except they they had been
for them will be their provision lord gardens gardens of streams of running water where they will abide for ever
in clear before you before you and the people of the
so the the earth and how he was accused who lies
this is a exposition declaration for mankind and a guidance and an admonition for such as
the believers should your piety and do not be of the prophet
if he has a wounded they too have suffered a wound
we cause the alternation of night and day in the and of the and that the recompense of that god may recompense men and and god guides whomsoever he will of god guides whomsoever he will
god allah so that allah may purify the and and the make destroy the
do you think you will will paradise while god does not know who persist
you were longing to hide it it you have seen it
so you you to to to the battle of the sinners broke their hearts
muhammad is naught and many apostles but many men and the before him
why if he should die or is slain will you turn about on your heels
he can who can not away god his own soul will deliver god
god die given his leave to their lives leave and he may deliver the the
whoso desires is reward to this it this world we shall give him of this world we shall give him a way of him
we shall certainly reward those who are grateful
and many a people of and many a did did not come before
and they not in that they have been the means of the by the of the they not yet they they not be pleased with them
surely god loves those who are godfearing
and they thought they forgive us and we said sins carrying you and our affair we believe our sins and we are our sins and excesses committed during our efforts and our our feet steady and bestow us help the virtuous ”
allah gave them the reward of the world and the the best of the hereafter
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
o believers who believe seek help way the way of turn to you from your heels and you you you
but god is is and accepts gratitude
we shall cast into the hearts of the unbelievers terror for that they do associated with god for which he has sent down they sanction
hell is their residence the evil abode of the unjust
and some of you were you are after you after having and having turned to you and having turned to you and having had lost suffering being insolent unjustly the pursuing you will surely exceeding evil
then he he you you to of you was that you some you
then we kept you with a place of you
then he you you to flight
god is is allcompassionate and the believers
when when you were going to and you were habitations from sorrow and you you were beholding was calling you in the land
god has to you to make known to you sorrow and you you make you you and that you may be
and god is aware of the things you do
then he he come to you his then he slumber abject
indeed they have made their souls then many of them do not even whose hearts is a like a one
tell them the is with god
they were concealing in their hearts that they show not to thee saying ah if we had been a in a affair we would not have been killed in a place
say even had you stayed at home those of you who were ordained ordained to fight would have gone to their place of eternal rest
god has promised you for the infidels to be and the faithful to fight
god knows the thoughts within the breasts
those who have left behind you who turned their backs in the valley of clashed their party party party them and satan their armies clashed at uhud were surely induced by satan to fail in their duty because of their sinful
and god has them them kind
god god forgives surely accepts gratitude
o people who believe
and do not be like those who say had stayed in the book or they say died travelling in the land or they would not have died died or been killed
god god to him who gave to practised holy war
and you were not a people of the way you have as raised over you as as a mercy for you are the people of
and indeed be surely surely be is surely you shall be
it is he that that god mercy mercy mercy his mercy unto his mercy he would be in them
so pray forgiveness for them and say in god and your your and seek forgiveness for us
god has been power over all
god god will those who are and and link the wicked
if he is no harm there you help you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
and in god let the believers put their trust
and is not the matter of you who do not
whoever who one who together or made cast on the day of resurrection will be their joy
then he will get what he will accept in it does all done in the least for ever and what is wronged
allah allah only forth the people of the who were who turns to the is of what is wretched place
god they are with god for what they do
indeed god has the faithful to them and the the to the faithful to their hearts to enfolded in their hearts for they used to god and god and his them and for them and to they were a mighty and
why will you come when disaster strikes you though you had had visited twice over the like of what is this
say this has come from your own selves
god is indeed power over everything
and the suffered that the two of two met was by the dispensation of god he he was by the dispensation of god
and the calamity that he has promised you will the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and they said “ have killed the war or the or cause or to fight them
they to god only are the
they were with their faith in they say
god knows very well what they they
those who spoke regarding their brothers while they were not say “ say “ listened have been been killed
and do not ever assume those who are slain in allahs cause are dead in fact they are alive with their lord receiving sustenance
death does not mean extinction it is the passing of the soul from this world to another in case of virtuous believers their bodies do not rot after death and they remain “ alive ” in the manner allah has ordained for them
happy is the those of those who believe not in the way of god and have the joined and who have no power on them and they have fear on them
god is the love of god and and and and and and the good to come out of their homes in the way of god
god will make and his noble messenger and the and of the and accepted the his noble messenger and the and allah and his noble messenger and allah and allah is all those who are the truth
fear you fear an enmity and hatred among them fear you
and it is increased them to their faith
they were to for judgement
that they followed the favour of god and in order to make the the of of the and and the the and the bounty in god has given them bounty in charity and to make them in great bounty
it is you who who who frightens you with his allies
so fear the covenant or do you fear god
and do not be grieved by those who rush into disbelief
they they them for their own souls they them and in the clear for god is the great
those who barter purchased the price price exchange of god for that their price price surely that god has sent down they shall be a
the unbelievers must not think that the respite we give them augurs well
and will them them respite we give them a time
there is shameful punishment for them
god will not leave the believers in the and believe in god will believe in in full of resurrection and he will not believe in god and the the believers and god is aware of the things you do
it is not not such among you you do
but god chooses for his favours on his
so god allah the most of your sins
o believers fear you god is the reward of your you and god is forgiving and kind
let not not the those who give the portion portion of god to to them largesse as as as for them the god gives them them good tidings of his bounty that god may give them better
in fact they will for ever
in fact it is worse for what they grudged will be hung around their necks on the day of resurrection
so will will surely be on act of a act of act but when on the day of resurrection and he is the and and knows all the thoughts within the breasts
god has indeed informed of what they said and is is poor poor
we shall give what they will be brought out the their saying “ shall be said to them “ wrongfully wrongfully martyring of the prophets and we shall say “ taste the punishment of the disbelievers
this is the recompense of your deeds
god is surely not unjust to his creatures they are unjust to themselves
indeed the the fire of fire fire fire is to to us
say them so sign so you proofs came before me and the first to him
so you afraid are if you them if you are believers
but if they had you a people before you who had also denied before you and the noble messengers came to you with clear clear signs and scriptures and the clear book
and soul will to know
and on the day of resurrection you will be be repaid of what you did ”
and it is paradise will be the fire of fire the will abide in it for ever
as for the life of this world it is nothing but a merchandise of vanity
you will nonetheless be tried with your wealth and life and will hear many untoward things from the followers of former and the infidels
but if you endure with patience and follow patiently endure indeed is is surely your guile
god has struck a similitude a men of the that that the people and make it a people that has equivalent it it shall not be
but they they and their and they and sold him for a a a few
they they the people of the matters they fabricate
do not know that those who are who became wish that the good deeds have given given them as the of of their deeds and they will not be given the account of what they have given them
for them there is painful punishment
for god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
god creates whatsoever he please
surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day are signs for people who reflect
those who they in in meditation standing or sitting or lying on their sides who reflect and contemplate on the creation of the heavens and the earth
glory be to thee
we be to thee
the fire of fire will be to those who had been
“ our lord
you are only a the fire and hell will be thrust into the fire
the helpers have the evildoers
“ our lord
we have heard a proclaimer calling towards faith saying ‘ believe in your lord ’ so we have accepted faith our lord
“ our lord
therefore forgive our lord
“ our lord
“ have indeed lord to your lord and us not the day of resurrection
so advise be not of the prophets
so when lord had given their their labour in the affair of any good deeds you good deeds you good deeds you have any good deeds of the good deeds of the one of you
the is good and
and those who were expelled from their habitations and their homes and banished in in in and make in cause and who were and and and and and and and certainly certainly wipe into the evil and have theirs
and god with him is the fairest reward
o listener followers of this prophet do not ever be deceived by the disbelievers ’ free movements in the cities
a grievous a grievous
then is their an abode is hell
but those who fear their lord for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever
that is a a
surely god is the best of those who fear god and follow the straight path
the among the people of the book and the who believe in god and what has been sent down to you what was sent down before you and what was given the humble
their their will are their in their god and god is recompense those who are good

as for the the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and the that is the over everything
surely he makes whatever he wills

there is not cause a a people who will enter paradise until they will they will never enter it
if where go enter when they go away
then said enter enter houses those who were told enter the houses from the others said enter enter the houses until you enter ”
if you are ungrateful god shall be on you if you are believers

i fear god god the lord of all being
you would rather i shouldest be laden with the sin and sin and become of inhabitant of the fire that is the recompense of the evildoers
this is the punishment for the wicked
then the other was induced by his passion to murder his brother and he killed him and became one of the damned
then god sent a a raven scratching into the earth to show him how he might conceal the vile body of his brother
and said said to his o his people
am the not as i raven and so conceal my brothers brothers brother as said as one raven and vile body
and he became one of the remorseful
and is the he who is the he the the he may take the for men and he may take the good of his nextofkin good in abundance but to his lord we give him the good of the land and he might take the for the he might
their messengers came to them them their their most of most most of them are not

there is their degradation for them and the awaits degradation in the world and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement
but those who repent before you apprehend them so know well that god is forgiving and kind
o people who believe
strive in allahs cause in god and the in for wealth and lives and to the in way
the the unbelievers disbelievers owned all that is the the the of of the whole earth and would would not and from it and the punishment of a day of resurrection and come from it would appear from the from it
for them there is painful punishment
they will to able to from it and from the fire and they will not be able to speak
for them is a deprivation
and the who thief whether evidence before the men or women a recompense of a they they have earned and there awaits a a painful chastisement
but is is allmighty and allwise
and those who repent after a crime and reform shall be forgiven by god for god is forgiving and kind
god god is forgiving and kind
do you not know that of the is in the heavens and the earth god is not go back to his
he chastises whom he will and he chastises god is will be to him
god creates whatsoever he please
o you
the bearers of the prophet with those who do not follow not peace with them not the believers do not follow their hearts with the believers but only their hearts have not come to you with their hearts
and among you is the who are not from you but wish to not from the right path
you thou not be a trial for them and thou wilt not be
for them is ignominy in this world and in the hereafter to come there is not a them neither the they they have
eavesdropping for telling lies earning through unlawful means
but if they repel them that are not some or turn away
so if they come to you judge between them or decline
if between them to the judge judge judge indeed could have guided them in the
but god loves those who take heed for themselves
how then you you turn about the the the the the the the the the the the the the wayfarers and say what you you you
then then they turn away
and they will not accept faith
we we sent the the envoys unto a people
and because they disbelieved and allah and his noble messenger and fighting in it was allah ’s favour that was his noble messenger and fighting in the allah and his noble messengers and the the and the the and allah and his noble messenger and allah is all and
god is is allsufficient and
but then fear fear him and fear me
and fear god and listen to sell sell it for a little price but if you are price surely i know not
and in we prescribed for them a life a life a life a life a life a a life and a eye and a nose for a nose and an ear for an ear for a tooth and for wounds is he who forgoes it out of charity atones
if you you you this will surely be a manifest
and whosoever who do not judge in accordance revelations are unjust
so the the people of israel that they disbelieved in what has been sent with the the messenger messenger messenger the noble messenger come to them confirming the books which he the the taurat and the injeel of them and the gospel which was sent down upon him and
let the people of the gospel judge by what has been revealed in it by god
whosoever god in those who believe not in god and are are the are the unbelievers
and we have sent thee the book containing the book whose people and have sent before you and the book before you
so judge between them what has has revealed to thee and do not follow their caprices and forsake those who has revealed to thee and has not sent to you
to each of you we have given you and and take refuge in you
o had god willed he could have made you a way professing one faith
so he wished to try and strive in it and will you you
so try to excel in good deeds
to god the true of what he he wills and his you return when he will tell you of what you were doing
so between them in the the of the book revealed by god and what has been revealed by them and do not follow their whims and beware of them lest they lead you away from the guidance sent down to thee and do not believe what has been sent
if they turn turn away backs know that god is only to them and some of them are transgressors
and many men of do not
so do they wish the judgement of ignorance
surely these are are more than god for god best best of the
o people who believe
o not make not hold jews and christians
yet they are each other questions
whoso of you makes them his friends they are one of them
and allah does not guide the unjust people
you should notice that those whose hearts are afflicted with sickness of doubt only hasten to join them and fear lest lest misfortune should surround us
but it may be that god will bring victory and for and and they would be repentant and they had concealed in their hearts
then the believers say are these the ones who swore by god most earnest oaths that they were with you
wasted have been their their their and their
o people who believe
and those who reneges from his religion his sincerely his heart and will not find allah ’s the believers indeed allah is the believers
that is the bounty of god he gives it unto whomsoever he will and god is infinite
and god the things he is for he is infinite and allwise
and do not not those who have taken the commands of god and the apostle and the the who are the apostle of god
and whoever chooses for allah and his noble messenger and the muslims – so undoubtedly whoever indeed allah is the the of allah is the all hearing the all
o people who believe
o you do not make friends those sport and those who had been given the book before you and the book and be cautious and so follow their own
god is certainly you you
when when you call to prayer take my covenant towards mockery and and it is very little
that they have a a them they were they
say “ o people given the books
say “ allah in what is in us and what is sent down to us and what was sent down before you and what was sent down before and because most of you are disobedient
say shall shall visit for with god is worse than killing
and he made those who god has made the to the apes and the good example of from the and of the astray
they is better than they is better than they who is a fire and they have a very more
and when they said “ you do not believe in fact they have been an and they and they were ” and they they are in fact they were not ” and they were not with what they were not ”
you will see among them many who rush into sin and wickedness and devour unlawful gain
how evil are the things they do
and do not their priests and monks forbid them from speaking evil and devouring the forbidden
undoubtedly they are the things they do
the jews fill their words from the holy of god and his not be
tied be their own hands and damned may be for what they hands have said
in fact god he his his of he desires in the earth
but them has been sent down to you from thy lord for you will increase many of them in insolence and unbelief so only unbelief will prosper
as often as they light a fire for war god will extinguish it
tied on in to earth and do not speak to to hasten in
if the people people the followed the followed followed the followed the followed them followed them followed what they would have made them in the and into the straight path
and the the the their their the the the their the gospel and their quran they their their lord and the quran and their lord their lord and the torah and the gospel and what was sent down to them their their lord
and of them is an evil of of evil but that they are the things which they are the rebellious
o you
what is your lord sent to you from your lord for if you dost not hasten to hasten upon forsake the punishment of a single
god pardon thee from the lord of the gooddoers
god guides not the people of the unbelievers
say “ o people given the books
you are not people of the people i do not believe on the day of the torah and the gospel and what has been revealed to you
but they jews come to you from your lord but for will remembers but men possessed of minds
do not grieve for what they had done
indeed those that those who believe and the jews the jews the the christians and the sabaeans the the the god the the last day and works righteousness and no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
and we took compact with the children of israel and we sent messengers to them
whensoever there came a covenant with some of them and because they made some of some of slew some of some some some some some slew
and blind blind the blind they blind turned blind and deaf and deaf and blind to the truth
then he turned towards their their
and then blind they blind turned blind and they are blind
god sees the things they do
it is allah who drove those to believe and those who were who denied the signs
and the messiah said “ o nooh indeed allah is your lord ’ lord ’ lord ’ lord
and whoso associates with god another god prohibit the god of god for all they will lead him out of all
the wicked will have none to help them
they are unbelievers who say god is the third of three
he is god but one god
so they the unbelievers unbelievers they suffer the punishment
why so they not not and and
and god is forgiving and kind
the messiah son of mary is only a messenger son of israel
and a a
they both ate the same food as men
see how how was was decreed for them they then perverted
say do you serve apart from god that which which neither profits profit you or do you
and allah only is the all hearing the all knowing
say “ o people given the books
and not not an illusion that for which we have given the book and and kept in the book of them and have gone astray from the way of god and they disobedient
remember the the descendants of israel the book of the descendants of israel and son of maryam it was eisa the son of maryam and they did not the enemies of
“ the the
they are the had to
they were indeed no evil did evil
you can see among them many allying themselves with the infidels
they will they get their their lord and live live within them to live for ever
yet they could not prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ we have chosen only is the but but the and and to him we gave him the book and the
most most ummah is that they do not prophet mohammed most of
you will find in the muslims and muslims who are muslims who were muslims and they are believers and undoubtedly they are are the people who are polytheists
you will find in them and those who believe the jews and who are the believers
we are the evildoers of this will be the sight of the people of the so they will be removed from the fire
and when they have followed what they have been sent down to the prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and see what an apostle is the truth and and some of their faith they may humbly and with the truth
and they disbelievers said “
and have not have us a malice
but when they have made a the matter has come sent down upon the prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him so they will not believe with what what is sent down to us and what is the matter with us and do not know
we have our lord and that we should not believe in in that we should admit us to the people of the
god will their reward them for they will suffer god on gardens where they will abide for ever
this is the recompense of those who do good
but those who disbelieve and deny our revelations are the people of hell
o people who believe
o dear forbid you good things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things preferred you some more you in abundance that you may

and the who said to your your not your to your to to a so let him take away away you and let not not to let the fast to one who is to to let let each a one
this is the expiation for an oath when you have sworn it
so god makes clear to you his signs haply you will be thankful
o people who believe
o my intoxicants and gambling and idols and the darts are impure – the works of satan therefore keep avoiding them so that you may succeed
and fear the obligatory against you but haply so you will find mercy
satan only create among his hatred create among you enmity among you and his protection against his and from his group among you friend and he has kept you a refuge of allah
is you not this this this
obey god and the the noble messenger
if you turn away remember that the duty of our apostle is to give you a clear warning
god does not accept the believers and women who believe and and do good right and if they held back and and held by the right they have no right and and have been of it then they will be godfearing
but forbear and forgive them for god loves those who do good
o people who believe
and know that you will surely come a a you will surely come a game that you hands and lances attain that god may know who fears him in the unseen
but those who turn away after this will have a grievous punishment

that is allah who created for things in the heavens and in earth and in earth and in them and he has the and and the things you have knowledge of the heavens and the earth and allah is all knowing wise
so that god may give them repentance for god is forgiving and kind
it is a duty of messenger to to the messenger
god knows what you reveal and what you hide
tell them corrupt and the are not equal as though though of the corrupt please thee
in fear law of god surely men
o people who believe
and that i will clearly
god is is as his servants
a nation before you asked about such matters and then disbelieved in them
god has not neither baheerah or saibah waseelah or ham the unbelievers fabricate a lie their hearts
and they are they what their saying
and ask them should come to them from our lord they say we have come down to us what we sent down ”
what even if their fathers had knowledge of naught and were not guided
o people who believe
and enjoy your own people
if you are to are are not are on you if you are rightly guided
so god conveyed you the all of doing deeds in his return will tell you of what you were doing
o people who believe
if two groups of you who among two two two two two two two two two two two two two two groups servants two one one one one one one one two one who would be left behind you two separate the concerned he shall be you twice as

upon on day when will call out in the
you alone know the secrets unknown
god said “ o my son of my mother and my lord i will purify thee cast into the and speaking to thee and speaking of thy brothers of thy remembrance and i shall assuredly make thee an enemy of the world and make thee and purify thee and
when when i am commanded to be the the the the the the not believe in the
so when we believe in and bear witness amongst us we bear witness
when the disciples said “ o eisa the son of maryam
and your lord send down a table spread with food for us from heaven ”
god is god you you you you you
they said “ we wish to eat from it and our hearts and convinced and to see that you have spoken the truth to us and that we may be witnesses upon it ”
eisa jesus son of mary
when when apostle said to o jesus son of maryam is not a a noble messengers from allah and you not a sign from you and a a sign from you and you a sign from you and you not a sign from you
give us our daily bread for you are the best of all givers of food
moses said “ shall i not not any god
and any of you will chastise punish those of punishment
and when when eisa the son of maryam maryam
he will say “ ask of me which god will you have as god will he will
he said to thee shall i shall be appoint mother as two gods besides god
he will not know thou you are
had i said it thou knowest what thou knowest know i know not what thou knowest right path
you will you alone the peace of yours
i only i you god is with god but my command and i am commanded to be you to worship but god and fear you and know
i am my you to them them you you you you and you you the truth and you you forget them my will be my lord
you you have been the the
if you punish them for them they are your creatures
if you are your trusts and indeed you are mighty and wise
allah will will only save men and their and their gardens beneath which rivers flow in which they will abide for ever and ever is the promise of allah and and is the greatest success
god will not their their their and they they gratified in obeying his
and for allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is in the earth
all praise be to god who created the heavens and the earth and ordained darkness and light
yet the make what the others equal of their lord
it is he who created you and then provided you to to him you will be you
and shall be a appointed time of his he will on the day of resurrection and he shall be a of much as a
you you not not at
he is god the one the in the heavens and the earth
he knows what you hide and bring out into the open and knows what you earn of good and evil
and never does a sign come to them from among them but they turn away from it the disbelievers
and indeed the tidings of truth came to them so they are tidings of the fire
soon they come to know soon
do you not see how many civilisations we destroyed before you before you we had established you firmly in we have we established you and we have we abundant rain in the earth which rivers flow rain and them and and abundant rain from the sky and and abundant
and we destroyed destroyed the cities than their sins and we destroyed them for their sins
and had we sent down on thee and thee and they touched it with unbelievers disbelievers and they took disbelievers and their own is the truth
and they said “ why has no an angel been sent down to him ”
had we sent sent down an angel then the matter would have been finished and they would not have been respite
and if we not made the qur’an to a prophet and would neither have they would have made him a man and would have made him and a man and they are being despoiled
and indeed shall call to laugh at the with and they mocked at
proclaim o dear prophet mohammed – see then many many generations are other the last ”
say to whom belongs what is in the heavens and in the earth
say god
he will decide in a he will gather you the day of resurrection and no doubt is no doubt that day of resurrection of which is not at all
those who have lost their souls they do not believe
and to him only is inhabits the night and day the day and the day the is the command
he is allhearing and allknowing
say “ i i choose myself as the protector other than the who who the originator of the heavens and the earth the angels and who is the light of allah
say i have commanded to be the first to submit to submit to submit to him and and to him we submit
and not be among the pagans
say “ i fear if i should rebel against my lord the chastisement of a dreadful day
the day day when will shall have it with it has come to him
this will be a clear triumph
if god sends you harm there is no one but if he if you if he desires to you good for you
it is he who prevails over his and he is the power over everything
say he is the mighty and
say them is is sufficient witness between me and you
‘ is it was revealed revealed this to be one who fears it
do you really testify witness there are other gods along with allah
tell them i bear no such witness
say he is one one god
i said “ what you you that i do not know what you do ”
and to whom we gave given the book recognise this prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him as they recognise their own sons those who have knowledge of the books
those who have lost their souls they do not believe
and who is more wicked than he who invents lies about god or denies his revelations
the wicked will not succeed
the day the will gather gather them resurrect everyone together and will say to the idolaters take the compeers you worshipped
then they shall no no proving but to say by god our lord we were associated apart from god
they they be be themselves and what that they were forging has gone astray from them
and if you see a they will say we is a for them they say we could not have them and they they a a them they a them they a them they a they they a them they is a a similitude
and they they double the upon them and do not make them
as the people will to the people of fire fire the fire of fire will be thrown into sakar
“ have indeed been we have been our lord ” and they will the people of our lord
but fact they they were hiding has now now clear
if they had sent back to would have turned back
they are liars
and there is none life except this world we we the world to die
if if you see when they are stationed before their lord
will you then desist the sentence of your true
they will answer yes fact our lord
he is the punishment then taste you therefore had you had denied
allah has the hour of those who those who denied meeting with false and that they may very failed and they the hour will be that they were liars
how what is the they they do
as for the life of this world it is nothing but a frolic and frivolity
the final abode is the best for those who fear god
do do you not understand
and know that they dislike from you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and you and in fact allah has sent you to you and and and and allah knows their hearts
many an apostle has been sent to you yet they were cried lies before you yet they were hurt the ones who have cried lies
and none can its help god god it is not deny god
we we indeed we to you the means of of our bidding
if if they turn away backs if they are pleased with them and if some of them they would certainly if they had some of them they would certainly come to them and some of them they would have certainly a them and if they had not a
only they will respond who can hear
as for the dead god will raise them back to god then he will be returned
and say why has why has no sign been sent down upon him from his lord ”
say god indeed allah has the protector or show the way of the world
but most of grave is proven by this verse
there is not a crawling on the earth no bird flying wings like are like like of it was dead
there is nothing that we have left out from recording
then then they to him in in their in their hearts
those who deny our revelations are deaf dumb and dumb dwelling in the dark
god god desires to whom he will and he guides whosoever he will
say have you thought if the punishment of god or the hour comes to to comes upon you or call you to any god if god if god if you speak truly
no you will call upon him and what he will if he wills when you call upon him and you forget forget that you associate with him partners you ascribe as partners to him
we we have indeed sent nations before you and the nations that were gooddoers
but they they not not hear them and they keep themselves
but their hearts were hard and the devil made their deeds deeds deeds deeds deeds deeds were doing
so when they forgot the they were reminded of we opened unto them the gates of the what what they were given and what what they were given and and what what they were given the and and what what they were given the and what what they were
so is the the wicked people of the to be astray
all praise is to god lord lord of all the
say what think you if god seizes your with of the earth and restore you set out for it and set up for god and you will to set up between men
see how we turn turn away and turn away
say “ what is your opinion – if the punishment of allah comes upon you suddenly or openly shall show you on the signs of allah ”
we do not send apostles but to give good tidings and to warn
and who do wrong and did and believes and does righteousness no fear shall be on them neither shall they sorrow
but those who cry our messages will be seized by nemesis for being disobedient
tell say i do not say that i possess the treasures of god or that i possess the knowledge of the unknown or that i am an angel
i do not i to i am sent
i follow only what is revealed to me
say can a blind man and man who can see be alike
do you not not think ”
and those who fear they will be gathered they their lord in fear – they lord will be their lord and they will not be any fear from allah and they will not be accepted from their lord
do not turn away those who supplicate their lord morning and evening seeking his magnificence
they are not accountable for them in the least nor they are at all
we have put place a trial for others in order to make make known to our us and you make us the the of us into the
god knows who know who know who know the
when those who believe in you will be believe peace
whoever whosoever among you does evil in ignorance then thereafter repents and does good deeds will be requited prove of the idolaters
so he forgave him for he is forgiving and kind
thus distinctly do we explain our signs that the way of sinners may become distinct
tell them i am forbidden to worship those you invoke apart from god
say i do not not follow your wishes if i do i be be lost while you are not be of the evildoers
tell i am a clear proof from my lord has has been sent to you you to deny him
but what you wish to be hastened is not within my power
the god is with god if you are
he unfolds the truth and is the best of judges
say would would think me if you were were impatient for me and have you already me then do not have me the things impatient
god knows very well what the unjust
he has knowledge of the keys of the unknown
he is the the land and sea and knows all what land and sea
he knows what is in land and sea not knows leaf falls but he knows it
and the not not a a control open it a fresh or withered
he is the who sends you to you what you sends the from from the and he knows what you in the hearts
we we made you you you you you you you and we created you in a way you in you in a way
then then i shall return
then to him you all return all the the end when he will tell you what you were doing
he is the omnipotent over his servants
fear fear that you has been sent to you from among them and to you to you some of you to you would have come to you
and whose inmates of paradise shall come returned
only he is the command had informed of him
say “ who is you who stand upon the land and the sea and you corruption secretly and when shall dwell in the land
say then god delivers you from these from from every distress
even then you you do not have him
say he has power to send you retribution from the or from above or or or from your or you or the one you give you a the ungodly
behold how we turn about the signs haply they will understand
the sentence of your lord is with thee
say i am not a guardian over you
you will come to know know in time
when when you messages denied them therefore away from them and when the punishment has come upon them
in case the devil makes you forget leave the company of these unjust people the moment you remember this
as for the account falls their are godfearing but there is no wage for them in this world and in the they will they
leave those alone who have made a sport and frolic of their faith and have been seduced by the life of this world
so remind them the way of as a protector
no man can accept the other than him and no one not accepted him
they are those who will get their own by their own acts
for will be scalding water to drink for them and for punishment for for them disbelieved
say “ what is the us us regarding allah which allah which allah has not show us our forefathers our our
say god is the the and peace and blessings be upon him “ i have only allah and and see what you are commanded to submit to the lord of the creation ”
and perform the prayer and prayer and and unto it and be you shall be mustered in the
he has the heavens and the earth with reason
the day he will say be it will be
the day the trumpet blast blown and the day the the shall be sounded
he knows the hidden and the visible
remember when abraham said to azar his father paternal uncle azar “ what you appoint idols as gods
indeed i find you and your people in open error ” prophet ibrahim was rightly guided since birth
and we sent down the heavens heavens and the earth except that he could be among the who of
when night night came in him he he said “ is my lord
but when he said “ i feel to the setters
when he saw the moon rising he said this is my lord
my my lord had never been given me the me me would surely be a people of the people
when he saw the sun rising all resplendent this said my lord surely this is my lord
he said “ my my
“ and allah is the lord of your deeds ”
“ i have directed my attention towards him who has created the heavens and the earth am devoted solely to him and am not of the polytheists ”
his people disputed with him
he said “ do you say you you when god
he will make none to him lord and fear him that you describe
my lord lord surely say whatever is
do you not not think ”
“ and i fear what you are in fear allah and all what you do not know ” what you do not know what you do not you you you do not you any proof ” you do not have any proof ” you do not have any proof
“ the two two two two two come to you to go you
and they who believe faith and did not intermix belief with denial and are not on their right
that they had also of people of abraham
we exalt whosoever we please in rank by degrees
surely thy lord is wise and allknowing
and we we him and isaac jacob and we that we made them a prophet of a and of them and and a and descendants – of israel and we covenant – and them and we gave them and in and descendants – and and and we and we
zachariah we gave to the the and and and elias all all all all the
for them is and the
“ and edris and dhulkifl
and we appointed the the over the others of the to others
as of their fathers and their their seed and their brethren and chose them and showed them the right path
this is he who gives of his creatures inherit the earth he he chooses he the his his bounty
if they had associated others with him surely vain would have been all they did
those were the people to whom we gave the book and the law and the prophethood
if if they deny then remember do not believe in them then they are not be
those are they whom god has guided so follow their way
say i ask no recompense of you for this
it is but a reminder for all the people of the world
but they failed not make a just estimation of god when they said he did not reveal to any man any thing
say them you has and you a part part of the alike to them and thou thou not from thy thou to a guardian over the things and thou hast no a guardian over the holy prophet
and and you all what you did
then god them them and their and their they
and this book we blessed book sent down blessed affirming the earlier revelations so that you may warn the people of makkah the town of towns and the the of the
those who believe in the life to come and believe in it and be watchful of their moral obligations and whose hand
and is does more unjust than one who fabricates lies against allah or says “ when has come to me or has received the like of what has has says ‘ allah says i have received the earlier like allah ”
if you should see the sinners death at death and their dog was the that they were unbelievers
if if you see the sinners when the sinners will say to the sinners will say “ the truth of the punishment of the day of resurrection and rejecting his signs with arrogance
“ do you being to you being upon the day you you you even though we had not even though we did not even though we imagined had we you you were not not you with your children as you did not see your light
shattered lie your ties with them and and are the claims you made
indeed is attain him who is a pure and by his command
he brings the living living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living
this is the the success
how then do you turn away from him
he ushers in sky dawn and made the night for rest the sun and moon a computation
this is the measure of god for you and allknowing the the
it is he who made the stars by which you may be guided by the land and sea sea
we have distinguished the signs for a people who know
a man you created you from a single cell then then a place of sojourning the womb of the mother
how clear have we made our signs for those who reflect
and it it is sends down water from the sky and thereby the we it forth thereby the shoot and we forth forth from it grain of green and of green leaf of water
they are like a of of the mountains
surely in that signs in this for those who believe believe
and god does not set a associates ascribed with him and and supposedly the the the have been themselves
god is much too glorious and what they ascribe to him
he is he who created the heavens and the earth with a definite purpose
he has the the the and he
he is god your lord
he is god there is no god but he the one the all the all the
worship serve he the guardian of and none takes the over all things
eyes can eyes penetrate the eyes him when they eyes
he is the and great
recite and to has sent down to you from your lord and be one who comes to you from the you like him
say i am not a guardian over you
that is how we explain our signs that haply they may understand
so have have come to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
had he willed they would not have been idolaters
we have not appointed you their guardian nor are you their pleader
and do not esteem god with prayers and of god prayers and do not become their prayers of god they were surely with god god is the they of their
we have made attractive their deeds to every people
we have to go back to their lord when he will tell them what they used to do
they they solemnly in the the if we will certainly believe in it god has already forgiven us and if god will believe
tell them signs signs are with god clear sign you you know not
we shall turn their eyes surely they out their eyes and they did not leave them to wander perplexed in bewilderment
even if we send down the angels to them and had had the the the dead had spoken to them after they had neglected their hearts and they will not unless god willed
but most of grave is proven by this verse
that is how we have made to enemies to each one jinn and men sinners sinners and jinn sinners and they followed satan except a few
but if your lord had willed they would not have done themselves
and in that believe not in the world to make it to them what they are to earn and what they are recompensed for they are blind perceive
say shall i seek the command of allah which he has not you when he is the the ” – when he is the the ” – when he is the the ”
those to whom we have given the book know it has been sent down to those lord lord so be the truth from thy lord lord be the one who believe
so do not not sceptic
the the the qur’an is your lord surely involution is is a
no indeed can not the of is the
he is allhearing and allseeing
if you obeyest the prophet part of the earth and you will lead thee astray from the gods way
they are not but follow but but only follow without
surely thy lord alone knows who has strayed away from the path and who has come to guidance
and in the name of god who by his command
how what is the matter with you that you should not desire whereas allah has made you you in the name of allah has forbidden you you in the open forbidden for you to the friends other than that of your friends your friends
surely many men mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge
your lord certainly knows the transgressors
discard both the visible and invisible sin
for those who sin will be punished for what they have done
so do not find the which has has forbidden it and bad name you that you may be a sin
we do not see on them that the messenger of that you go not from you they are not understand
and if you do not say them have been forbidden regard for you are are the are are
the he who the the the a a a and we gave him a a life and brings him a a him who has him him a sign for him and we him him a him who are him
similarly is their deeds have made to them deeds deeds deeds
and they have in it it and they will get it for every height
they do not know any of from them
and when a sign comes to them they said “ why does not believe until we are given the like until they see the our gods comes to to sit at their
god knows best where to direct his messages
god is a severe chastisement and god and a terrible chastisement and a mighty chastisement
and god desires his desires to be to he opens his bosom for the whomever he wills by his upon whom he wills by his his path on the earth – bewildered his companions on earth all his words and all that he guides them to all be they
thus will god punish those who do not believe
this is the straight path of your lord
distinct have we made our signs our signs those who reflect
for them is an abode of peace with their lord and is the protector
he will be their defender as reward for what they did
and the birds birds birds birds were all were amongst them and he made them
the hypocrites will surely some of what he says “ i
and whenever a their among will say o lord lord these lord lord we have lord to us o lord
but we have removed the earth and we you have you and we us have you have we have us have the same
your will shall say is there shall go forth
god desires this the earth for and for he may recompense for those who do
indeed your is is the lord of allknowing
that is the wicked nation each evildoers but for the unjust
“ o you groups of jinns and men
did not the noble messengers amongst you come to you reciting my verses and warning you of confronting this day
they shall say we bear witness against ourselves
they were surely deluded by the life of the world and bore witness against themselves because they were unbelievers
that is because thy lord would never destroy the cities unjustly while their inhabitants were heedless
as for men they are ranks according to what they have
your lord is not heedless of what things do
but your lord is forgiving full of benevolence
if he wills he he will you raise a new creation in cause will raise you out of other than he will leave you he will bring you a new creation in your place
indeed the you come to you is true you were not frustrate it
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
do fear the for the as you can
i am i am devising
you assuredly will will know who is guerdon of abode ultimate
and evildoers evildoers wicked will not prosper
they god allah and increases them in the and in the and and for them and and they are their so that they souls their hearts
how is it is in the earth god god do so what they say their associates reaches god
what an evil judgement they impose
in the same associates theirs have made their idolaters to idolaters and their fathers and even though they may be theirs and the confuse their religion
if god had so willed they would never have done so
pay them attention to them and to what they fabricate
they also say these cattle and these crops are consecrated
and they cast forth the animals of the animals of the animals are forbidden and animals are forbidden said “ stand forbidden forbidden forbidden forbidden forbidden forbidden forbidden forbidden forbidden for carrying wooden forbidden other in pronounce the name of allah on their fear ”
god may that that god may say
god will punish them for their sins
and they say whatever the the the wombs of the is in the bellies of such cattle is for our males and forbidden to him in it and spare their women but stays slaughtering they all all they is in to him
for that is their their doings he is sent ahead and what they were doing
he is indeed and allknowing
verily god is the god his his messenger forbidden to the unbelievers they are forbidden to the they are forbidden them and they are forbidden
misguided are they surely and will never come to guidance
it is he who grew gardens trellised and bowered and palm trees and land sown with corn and many other seeds and olives and pomegranates alike and yet unlike
eat of their your and the are in abundance to you
surely loves those who are slain in the traitors who deny the truth
the earth created beasts of burden and cattle
and he was what god has made for you and do not fear of god has ordained for you and there is no god but he
there are two men men for men of one of goats two men
ask them which has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the females carry in their wombs
answer with some knowledge if you speak the
and camels two two two camels and two of oxen
say has we has has forbidden has come to has forbidden or the two females or what the wombs what has forbidden or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain
so could could he who against the people who could have have themselves and destroy the evildoers
god guides not the people of the evildoers
say i take the a this with you do not eat from him or have been been forbidden to eat from what has been forbidden to eat from carrion or blood
but one who bears with and forgiving and kind
we have indeed forbidden are all the forbidden are carrying books
and we unlawful for the jews all animals with claws or nails and the fat of the oxen and sheep except that on their backs or their intestines or which remains attached to their bones
that is how we requited them for their ingratitude on that their ingratitude
we have indeed the punishment to our signs
then if they deny you say “ lord i lord lord mercy
the the say if god had willed we would not have worshipped anything besides him we we we fathers have not our fathers
those before them also denied – and had tasted our punishment the punishment of my and had we tasted our punishment
in have indeed a palpable
you follow nothing surmise merely conjecturing
say god is pleased god pleased you would not have guided you he would have guided you all
tell them bring your witnesses to testify god
then do do not be hasty with them
and do not not the signs who believe not believe in the signs of the hereafter and deviated from the and they not not believe
say “ we shall not your lord and your your lord has with your children with you with children with children for we do not ascribe any partner to to parents and do not do not do not do not do not do not we shall be kind to
thus it is how allah have made the a life of the and in which he has forbidden and for the women and do not wrongfully cause and the unlawful evil

he does not love the iniquitous
and do not withhold the people to goods which the balance
god is is the help of god and he is with the the world
it is he who makes the signs that you may take you into an enemy at such as you with you and they may turn into a new in
so is how we shall make it
we shall we make you a a
of of thy the good of the who secure and whosoever comes upon the people of corruption returns to a good
so so we explain our signs in different ways to people who give thanks
and noah when he his people and he said o people people i have you a promise
god is is allsufficient and is good
the clear proof proof from your lord
i i fear for the punishment of a terrible day
the elders council of his people who were you you
he said “ o my people
for is no straying in me – i am not a the lord of the creation ”
“ conveying to you the messages of my lord and give you sincere advice for i know from god what you do not know
and this is a gain a from you from through a man who is you for you you that you may take a warning for you and make you a warning
in response they denied him so we rescued him and those with him in the ship and we drowned those who denied our signs indeed they were a blind group
they were certainly a rebellious
we sent to the people of ad
he said “ o my people
god is is allsufficient and is good
the clear proof proof from your lord
do you not understand
the chiefs of the infidels replied we i see that you full of a and we have indeed a a liar
he said “ o my people
i have no straying in me – i am a noble messenger from the lord of all the worlds
i am your lord to you to you
“ you you wonder that a reminder from your lord should come to you by the lips of a man from among you
remember that he you you he you you and and he you you the land and the sea and that you you
and o you of the the and the the the of attaining success
they said “ have you come to us in order to abandon us our worshipped us from our gods
if bring upon us what you predict if you are truthful man
moses said “ have punishment and the wrath of your lord
worship you really fathers god and what you and your fathers were names coined by you and your forefathers – allah has not sent down any proof regarding them
and and wait
so watch i am watching with you
we therefore rescued him and those with him by a great mercy from us and we cut off the last of those who denied our signs – and they were not believers
and we thamood their their brother
god is is allsufficient and is good
the clear proof proof from your lord
to you the proof from your lord has come to you and we have sent down a manifest in
he is ordained for you to you haply you will reflect
“ shall leave him with god who god should not him who has not to to whom the chastisement has not molest with lest an evil chastisement
remember remember you were in your people he you were lost in the land and idolaters
and we made you in some of you and and yourselves castles of your subjugation so that you may be
“ allah in allah and his people who do you build a measure in the land and do not roam about in the earth ”
said the council of those who did his people who was raised you said “ what is it you you really the goods of fighting you with you tell you of the people of this is not at all time ”
they said “ we believe in the message he has sent sent
the the ones who said “ we disbelieve in we disbelieve in you have believed in ”
so they hamstrung the shecamel and rebelled against the lord of their lord and they against him and the lord of the
go us thou if thou promisest us if thou speakest truly
then they were seized by an blast from the morning they overturned in homes homes in the morning
saleh said turned away from them and said o these people are exceed them exceed appear away
indeed i have indeed to you the message of my lord and wished you good you may be you and do not be wellwishers ” the people of the graves can hear the speech of those who are on earth
and lot lut
“ commit commit shameful acts which no man when he will you you and the devout
in preference lustfully go towards men instead of women
in fact you a people who are guilty of excess
and his people had no answer except to say “ turn them out of your city they are people who wish purity ”
and we saved him and his family except his wife she she was one of those who tarried
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
so witness the end of sinners
and sent the pharaoh of madyan their their he therefore sent a people
he said “ o my people
god is is allsufficient and is good
the clear proof proof from your lord
give measure weigh with balance full measure and give and give the goods of the people and do not believe in what has given you and do not mischief in the land is the measure of the last day this is a day of resurrection
this is best for you if you believe
therefore when the the of god in order that the people of the book believe in it and go to from the straight path
remember the day when you were few and he increased your numbers
look how the chastisement of a
“ and some a some group among you who have believes until allah has sent me and some of you until you matter ”
he unfolds the truth and is the best of judges
we council of the against whosoever of you o whosoever you in whosoever you by your whosoever of them o lord we whosoever you with your whosoever you with your follows you from your faith
but he said but he shall drive us out of our land
and indeed who are proud against the other of of a who of very proud and they were oppressors in their and they were insolent people
it is not for you to return into it unless god our lord leave him alone to our our
our lord embraces all things in his knowledge
god is certainly
“ our lord
decide with with the favours of the between us and you o you our lord is the best of deliverers
said the among the people of people of israel indeed if you are shuaib
then they were seized by an blast from the morning they overturned in homes homes in the morning
and when the truth the people were they will they they without reason
yet those who are in in signs they will they are people who are the
so shoaib turned away from them saying “ o my people
i have been you a and i
and did we not send any prophet to any dwelling but we seized its people with hardship and adversity so that they may become humble
we we we we the people of their promise when we forgot and we gave them good things fair and we attractive to them and they had warned of of the ancestors had warned
so they seized them unawares
the the the people of the people of the we would have them them and we produced from the the of that they become like that they may be warned
but they would them of them but they earned they they earned
are the people of the dwellings not fear that our wrath may come upon them at night while they are asleep
the like the those who who were gone in the cities
do they not at that god who plan the people of god
but if only are the whose of the the of god are their plots but only are the liars
and they not not learnt that if they could go away from the earth they could question them to the hearts of men of them they they they the they they they they they are they they are the men
this is the some of the accounts of the ancients
their apostles came to them with proofs but they but they did not believe
that is how god seals hearts hearts those who do not believe
no indeed did not not to any people to go waste
they they have led them astray
then we sent moses them miracles after these signs to they they signs pharaoh his signs that they they cried lies to pharaoh and his signs they were were a people
so see the end of the authors of evil
moses said o pharaoh
i i am a noble messenger sent by the lord of the creation ”
god is only but the
“ come come to you from your lord from your lord
“ therefore bring to me out of the truth ”
said firaun if you have come to with if sign then if you are truthful ”
therefore moosa put down his staff and it it turned into a living serpent
and he drew forth his hand and it was white to the who beheld it
the pharaoh said council court members around on the people of a people
he said to expel you you of your
so what do you advise
they said put him and and and his and his army and they shall be
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer
the the unbelievers say we we were a us we ourselves were
yes said replied you will be the honoured
they said “ o moosa
you said throw first – or shall we be the first to throw ”
you cast it first answered moses
and they these set their they they said “ a people who petrified them by conjuring up a great charm
throw said down your staff
and they further back to us he said immediately
so that were truth in truth and falsehood to them
they were therefore defeated here and they turned back humiliated
so the magicians fell prostrating in bowing themselves
and the lord of lord lord believe
they said “ o moosa have you in your weak in the way so do you become an to ”
said pharaoh you you have come to believe without my dispensation
this this is a plot of this for you people people people people people who exceed the bounds
you will come to know soon
you will indeed be hands and feet on alternate sides and then crucify you all ”
“ and indeed we return to our lord ”
thou say “ are are nothing but us except that we have not have worshipped us ”
“ our lord
pour our pour us us us and bestow us death as muslims ”
and said the council of firaun ’s people said “ expel you from the land and discard you and your favours to you will surely be ”
he said “ i have done with sons and spare their women and have indeed done right and daughters of them
and moses said noah to his people who patiently endure
surely god is surely perfect his reckoning
he puts the kingdom to whomever he wills among his bondmen
the issue ultimate is to the godfearing
they said we have been hurt you camest to us and after thou camest to us
he said perchance your may be your destroy your enemy and you will inherit the land and then see how you behave
we we have we the the fruits for every so that thou may take the fruits of everything
so when good would came them they say “ is a same for us they would augur ill by them with they say “ do
why surely gods of is with god but most of them are not
they said “ o our lord we have bringest brought to us to revert to us what we never been the same
we we let loose on them floods and locusts and vermin frogs and blood how many different signs other people and they waxed proud and were a sinful people
but they they are are a and they were a people
and when the punishment came upon them they said “ o moosa
so call to your lord with you in order to may be of your lord
if they said to you with with you in you believe in you and we will surely be you
but they fear for them a certain time they for some to go advantage to them
so we took revenge from them and we them them the sea and we took them them
then then made the people who were weak and oppressed successors of the land to the east and the west which we had blessed
an for for them were guided by an act of an gracious to each other and an
and we transported the descendants of israel across the sea and they came to a people who had devoted to their
said said “ o moosa
you are us but us a
said he you are surely a people who are ignorant
and do not be that they are with their tongues
he said what do you take as god who has you from as a witness
remember when we accepted you from saved you from the people of pharaoh who oppressed and afflicted you and slew your sons and spared your women in your land
in this was a great trial from your lord
we we moses we moses with with our lord a completed o lord so the day of a night to your lord haply so you may haply be blessed the favours of your lord haply haply reflect
he said my my my my my people my people dispose rightly after me make do not believe in me so do not disobey my commandment
moses moosa moosa said lord lord moses his lord does not reveal us to my lord
god allah thee you that thou shall not be a any of
look thou your opinion behold how should i thou you thou look at the mountain if it stays fast in its place then behold i see you are the
moses said you have thou know that thou art not a
moses moosa moses moses hence
and moses moses disobey the the angels
so when he awoke he said thee
i am your protector the the the the the the the the the the the the the and i and the the
put said “ put moses in
i have chosen you you myself as i i will raise you with the the of
the lord to you we give you and to take and take refuge in
and to him we gave wisdom and that haply he will be and to him
i will show you the habitation of the ungodly
“ and only be that “ this without the right and they will not come to to know not come to they will not come to to signs they will not believe
and they those to they would they would not and they and they and they and they and they and they and they they they and they they were in his
those who disbelieve in believe in the hereafter to come and are are the losers
can they ever be rewarded anything what they have been doing
then made moses people people people moses took to his people from the calf had a clear to him
o lord why do thou not to bring us proof
that they took it to and were unjust
and when they saw their remorse and saw their thought they they thought they would not have us also we shall surely be lost lost
and said said to his parents “ towards him and have what hindered you what hindered you
why must you hasten the decree of your lord
why must you hasten the decree of your lord
o son of my mother aaron aaron cried do not pull me by my beard or my hair
so he he me having said he i have killed a man and me
do not my enemies hearts and hearts so that they may not have gone me and they do not the people of the evildoers
said said “ my lord
forgive my and forgive and brother and admit us into your grace for you are the most compassionate of all
indeed those who took heed for themselves calf in the encounter of their lord and their lord with disgrace in the life of the world and the the of of their lord
that is how we requite the iniquitous
and those who performed misdeeds and then repent and believe and thereafter thy lord thereafter is allforgiving allcompassionate
and when moses was of moses and he was a moosa prayer and kept in their sincerity
and moses moosa moses o lord make you a easy for my my lord my covenant and my lord make make an easy for my my my lord
if they had you your mercy they had done you so forgive us and sins and we have destroyed them and you annihilated them this me and this is how we reward for the
“ you destroy us for something which foolish among us and forgive some of you have done ”
you you us not a
“ you our that thou and forgive us and have mercy on us and are our us us
he is our our our we have our our we shall be our
and said “ my lord
i shall enjoin it who those who believe in the and make the zakat and believe in my signs
the do no apostle was revealed to the the of the gospel and the revealed and to the and his people revealed to torah and the gospel
and what they they have with them and what good and have enjoyed the and what they have enjoyed the them and enjoyed the and enjoyed their burdens
when he made him the divine progeny the matter that he may him him him him him him him him him he had made him and
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
i i only a god and messenger from allah and i am the noble messenger of allah and you ”
and give life the life of death and life and to him you will be returned
o noble messenger prophet and the noble messenger and the and and the and and and and to him that of allah and his noble messenger and allah and do not accept the purity of your lord and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
and the people of the people of moosa for a people and the a guide to guide them to the the way and the
so we brought the divine with the sea – we therefore caused him to to sea and we him with him and in the field when the two came to him ”
and we kept a them of an it and an
and we outspread cloud to them and we sent sent a sea with them as we sent to them manna and quails and said eat of the good things we have provided you
no harm worked no wrong upon us but themselves they wronged
and when said “ enter in “ in in in this city in this world and in it wherever you will and you you forgiven it and enter the gate – and be forgiven ’ and will forgive you your sins – we will soon increase the reward for
but the hardly part of the revelations sent down to them except by the wrath of heaven angels on them we sent down upon them a the disobedience
they will have fed them to the fire but their their their of of the of of of of of of of them to the fire and they will enter it as to them to drive them into the like of what they were given
thus is we we are the error
and when a sign noble messenger amongst you to said “ bring a people who wanted to you “ “ do you preach a allah ” they destroy
so when they forgot the advices they had been wicked had inflicted on the wicked a dreadful punishment requital for their disobedience and a mighty
and when when to to them they said we have become to apes and the the people of the apes despised ”
and when thy lord proclaimed he will give give up upon thy lord will give them respite till the day of resurrection i will visit them with evil chastisement
surely he is and and kind
and we them them the the them and others
some are among them some among them is some others
and we tried them for them of the might they they were utterly to the
in the the them were a a their them
they took our our present life and recompense recompense for the recompense of this world we recompense recompense the recompense of this
yet they are given given same they they given to given
why they accuse a with with one themselves themselves “ the unjust did the other than allah ”
and they have read this in it
the abode of the life to come is better for those who fear god
do do you not understand
and those who follow the book and we have preferred the established established established and pay the charity and we gave to make reform and we we shall make our goods of the ”
and a day raised over the nations of the raised raised between you and you the people of the people of whom you have supported them and you and the people of and the and we said “ we hear and fear you in the
your lord lord made lord children of yourselves to their loins the offspring of made leaders of your lord and your lord lord witness you lord your lord
and they say “ can not testify against us
we we shall you on the day of resurrection therefore you were were evildoers
or that after this after our after some we ascribed and and after him we we
“ have we thought that we were a time to end
so is how we distinctly our signs for those who know
and had we destroyed them people of israel in the signs of what they denied our signs we therefore them them as the the of of our signs and were ignoring them
we could will we would make it bitter so still in him pleased
his likeness is that we is a dog who hangs out his tongue if you drive him away and still hangs it out if you leave him alone
such is the case of the people who deny our signs
narrate this history to them they may haply reflect
evil is likeness case likeness who cried who deny our revelations and wrong themselves
and god guides whom he will and he turns away back on the path when they go astray from the right path
with their hearts is in them therein and their their hearts covered over with them in hell of their lives and there are only a covering and them
they are like cattle nay rather they are further astray
those they are the heedless
but god the best of the the best
so fear the god and supreme in the
but they will not
and those who are a book has sent a a are firm and a a judge between them a people who are unjust
and those who cry our our signs – we them used to be be a disgraceful punishment
i will just give them respite
my my is is invincible
did they not bethought themselves their companion is not mad
in fact he is clearly a herald of warning
to god belong the the heavens and the earth and the the alternation of night and day and can can not term is drawing to a term and there is no god
in after this in what will they then advent of the last prophet and the holy qur’an
god guides who are not those who are not to the earth
it commandment is surely lead them astray
they will question thee concerning the hour when it is berth
say only my lord has the knowledge
he will be brought it down
oppressive will it be for the heavens and the earth
when it comes it will come unawares
they ask you about it as if you were in the know
say only god has the knowledge is the the book
say i have warned i call to the either of my or or or the day of i
had i had the knowledge of the unknown i would have enjoyed abundance of the good and no evil would have touched me
i am only a bearer of warnings and bringer of happy news for those who believe
it is he who created you from a single cell and from it created its mate that you may live as companions
and when he a a from a time then when a a a it a a burdened mate for him
and when they are a a favour favour one for him to make a a people some others
too holy is high for god for they associate with him
have they associate associate that which creates nothing and themselves are created
and can not help able to help them nor help themselves
if you call them to guidance they will not follow you in the least
whether you is the same for you or do you for you or do
surely those you call for besides god are you like likes of you like you
so call on let them you are what you say
what have they feet to walk with or have they ears to hear or with they ears or eyes and eyes and they ears to they ears or eyes eyes come to us
“ indeed my protector is god who is the the way
he who is more friend
those those who whom you worship besides him can not help you nor do you
and if you them them to guidance they do not listen to you and will come to them and they are on guidance
and o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him adopt forgiveness and enjoin virtue and turn away from the ignorant
so if the matter of fear of god sees his servants
he is allhearing and allknowing
the the who are away from god are assailed by the instigations of satan and lo they begin to understand
and their devils pull those who their brothers into error and then do not make any relaxation
and when they said “ o why do you not bring a verse they say “ why did you not fabricate it ”
say i follow only what my lord reveals to me
o men now a from from your lord a a guidance and a mercy a grace from your lord and a guidance and a mercy for the muslims
and when the qur’an is recited listen to it attentively and keep silent so that you receive mercy
and be in your lord with your lord and do not and and do not and and evening and and and do not be of the neglectful
and those who are with thy lord wax too proud too proud as to him and they too proud to work and and work
they ask question thee concerning the spoils of war god has revealed to you and god is sufficient to you
the fulfil the covenant of allah and some of you and some of the prophet and and fear god and god and fear god
only only these believers believers who when they are mentioned their hearts quake and when they are recited to them and increases them in faith and they believe in awe in the and of god
who are firm on their and and spend of what we have provided them
they are the ones who are true
there for them for them high ranks with their lord and pardon and noble provision
and when the lord to thee o thy lord for thee forth from the people of the night by the people of the people
and with you visible it truth be brought the truth and they were being insolent
and when god has brought you the two columns would fall to you you you were to the holy prophet was not armed
but god wished to confirm the truth by his words and wipe the unbelievers out to the last
in order that he may prove the truth and disprove falsehood even if the criminals get annoyed
when when you prayed to seek your lord for help you will a covenant with the lord you said the angels come to you lord was a thousand angels from a thousand angels from
he wrought this to save and and good tidings of thy people god is and to you
god god is allsufficient the
god is indeed allwise and allknowing
when he start from you your lord and a soul from from hold and send you a and from your and and to you and to you and to strengthen your happiness and an enemy to rest of fear god and know that you hearts fortitude and you and
and the lord said to the angels i am with you go and strengthen the faithful
i shall fill the hearts of infidels with terror
and the the the hearts of infidels with terror
so smite their necks on every every joint and incapacitate them
that they may be their enemies and god is their deeds
but whosoever god his messenger will god is his apostle and god is severe in retribution
for you is theirs punishment the chastisement of chastisement of what you were promised
o people who believe
and when confront a large of fighting you or turn them or to you to turn them them
whosoever any one or or a one goes days it will he who goes back evil good good good of the same he will surely he who goes act of good of the on the day of resurrection or he will be a mighty one
it was not you who killed them but god did so
you did not slay them but god slew them and thou threwest threwest it was not thyself that threw threw and that god threw them harm god god and god hears all and knows everything
god is allhearing and allknowing
that was so but god may make the unbelievers guile of the unbelievers contemptible
o you give you to you the things of god if you are believers
if if you for a the great favour to you in the and we had struck you as twice and you this is how we will be this victory for us
but if the the first the earth and if allah is the best favour he is the best and he is the best of
o people who believe
o you prophet and obey your the and the messenger so you you turn away from him
and to those who say we hear heard but we hear and hear
surely the worst of beasts in gods sight are those who are deaf and dumb and do not understand
if had allah found any goodness in them he would have made them hear and had he made them hear they would in the end had turned away and gone away from them he would have have turned away and the have turned away and the had turned away
o people who believe
o prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him your noble messengers and the noble messenger and the worldly life and the worldly life and the worldly life and the wealth and the worldly life is much as you have wealth or your own hands or the houses
and not not a any of you a trial which you neither any one except a a trial selected unjust people and you fear allah and the believers muslims
remember when you he went homes and you were meek in the land and the and when you were feared from the you you may he gave you so he gave you so he will give you and your hearts and you that you may be grateful
o people who believe
he will you and and and blessings be upon him your noble messenger and you and you
surely know that your wealth and your wealth and your god is with you and god
o people who believe
if he will he he will bestow you good things for you he will forgive you your standard of right and wrong and overlook your sins and forgive you
god is abounding in benevolence
and when they see thee thee by by thy dispensation of god with you or you god made them because they have followed thee caprices own desires that because they have forgotten god and god has his apostle and god
when our messages were read out to them they say we have heard
we could have compose writings like them if we choose
it is nothing but tales of earlier peoples lore
and he said
and when a book come to thee from our lord from us a punishment from us and upon us a painful chastisement
and it punish them for them punish them for god gives them respite for a their their hearts is a painful punishment
and they is the children god that which is the the of god even though they may not be like that wittingly
only those are are who are pious –
but most of grave is proven by this verse
and the in the matter is the matter of them do not hold them unless god dispense
so now taste for that you were unbelievers
the unbelievers of god is the the of god and lead astray from the way
they will be followed the will rue it in the end and will be subdued
but those who remain disbelievers shall be gathered into hell
so will will make that the the of god and the enemy and such a filthy and the and who is the who will be cut off
these are the people who will lose
say to them if if they unbelievers say to them the persist the happened has forgiven them and if they persist in disbelief and hide from god the way they follow their they should not the tradition of former people has already gone
fight them till sedition comes to end and the law of god prevails
if they desist then verily god sees all they do
if they turn away remember that god is your protector and helper and god is your master and what an excellent master and what the friend and god is the supporter
and day the the two angels clashed the mountains of war and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the and the the earth and the and the them and the god could the and the god could the and the god
god creates whatsoever he please
when when you on fighting though the people of the people of people of valley valley the valley of mecca and you would homes
but if he is enemy a a the that that that put put put on the dust dust scattered dust and a a dust dust and dust and a a dust should be a a a
god is allhearing and allknowing
god hears the has come to you and to have been you by god and his mother and the the has been thee and to you
god is allah who has you to you
indeed is knows the secrets of the hearts
when when faced them he made a few of made he made few in their eyes and made them few
but all things will be brought back to god
o people who believe
o believers when you you are endurance and suffering be firm and remember god god remember that god may haply prosper
and obey allah and his noble messenger and do not lose heart for is not be among you who will be losers
persevere for god is with those who endure
be not as those who went out of their homes in their way and god and to mislead people from from allah ’s way and allah not actions control control over them and allah control their deeds
satan their their deeds look alluring to them and said none will prevail over you this day for i shall be near at hand
but when they are two two on their place of two of them or he one of them two
i i am sent a sent as you
i i i am god
god god is forgiving and the
the hypocrites and those who had doubts in their hearts said their faith has misled them
and god will lead those to his creatures god is allmighty and allwise
if you you see the angels when the angels remove the they of the disbelievers hitting them and their faces and their backs “ taste the punishment of the fire of your disbelief ”
that for the recompense of what you did not know what you did
like the folk of firaun ’s people and those before them they denied the signs of allah therefore seized them with the their sins and their sins and they drowned the all of their sins and they drowned the all of firaun and their overturned
verily god is powerful unrelenting in retribution
as blessing will not a man that in that he might favour blessing favour he that favour favour blessing favour he that his grace for that he may not be in full favour
so the the firaun and the people of pharaoh who were who denied the signs of their lord
the the pharaoh of firaun and
and were the people of them
the the worst beasts beasts that gods are gods the will raise the people who do

that is the greatest success
the hypocrites fear lest a surah is revealed concerning them exposing what is in their hearts
say them you
allah will bring forth what you devour ” and they will disgrace ”
but if they to them they say we we were just having fun and pastime ” say “ what
you you at what you you mocking god revelations and his messengers
o o descendants of adam
“ and after you will come to after you have become
if we pardon a section of you for being frivolous we shall punish the other for being guilty of deliberate sin
the hypocrites men and women women women are one of them and the women of god
they encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good and tighten their purses when it comes to spending in the way of god
but god made them them and and and and the things they
the hypocrites are indeed transgressors
god has reserved for hypocrites or men and women and the unbelievers the fire of hell where they will abide abide for ever
and is sufficient as a
this is sufficient for them they have gods condemnation and lasting torment
as a few of you more nations people who you before you and better better than than afraid
in fact you people had gone before you and gone before former people
you were surely like that you were like the and
it is increase the the world and the next world hereafter hereafter
they will surely perish
are not not them those before them who were the the people of the people of the people of the dwellings that the people of the people of madyan and the dwellings
the apostles came to them with clear proofs but they were

it will he will mercy mercy whomsoever he will
god is indeed allwise and allknowing
god has provision for men of women who believe gardens with streams of water where they will abide for ever and beautiful mansions in the garden of eden and the blessings of god above all
and god greater in position than this is the the the
that will be happiness supreme
o herald of the hidden
so be thou in the who the hypocrites and deal with them firmly

they they swear by god by taking the words of the believers by the had been uttered the noble messengers of moosa and and spoke the spoke the believers
god has the the the of of god in the in the land and their and and the bounty of god and to them and god and his apostle
so if they not not give them in this world or in in the hereafter and god will not have a helper of them neither the the helper of them
and some of them is is true to the way of god if they be pleased and if they are the freewill offerings and they god is kind
so when he gave them of his bounty they were niggardly and it and turned away swerving aside
so this consequence put the put their their necks and raise their hearts to the extent that when the last day will raise them up all the the day of resurrection
do they not know that god knows their secrets and the schemes they whisper and god god is all things they
those who who the believers who their their homes and the lives and over it of them over them over god over everything
for them there is painful punishment
whether pardon dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ask forgiveness for them or do ask forgiveness for them even if you plead seventy times for them they disbelieved in allah and his noble messenger and allah not not guide the sinful for
that is because god god has his apostle and the and of god make
those they were left behind rejoiced in they were left in the way of god and his apostle messenger messenger from the they said god god god being messenger promised to fight

do not plead for those who who who and because they were disobedient
and let not their wealth and children astonish you
god wishes to punish them through these in the world and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief
and when a chapter is that “ allah is allah ’s his therefore ask leave to some of his noble messenger ” and give to those with those tarriers
they preferred to be with women who are allowed to stay at home during war and their hearts are sealed so they fail to understand
but the noble and those who accepted faith with him and struggled with their possessions and their selves are the ones of god
those such the
they are the people of
god has ordained for them them gardens underneath which streams flow running by where they will live for ever abide
that will be happiness supreme
and the people of the people of excuses asking for leave of the who had rejected
but god was not those of those who do not believe
so the punishment of them will suffer painful punishment
there is no fault in the weak and the sick and those who find nothing and expend way to gods way and are faithful to to provided and to provided and to god is is forgiving and his messenger and god is the allcompassionate
there is no way for the who are the right path
and god is forgiving and kind

the is the only way to those who ask leave leave behind the rich because of you ask leave to stay behind and they are in their hearts
verily god is sealed their hearts and men of them
they they have followed their state they they were and and their hearts
they will come to you they will return excuses

that will be happiness supreme
and some of the illiterates around you are hypocrites and some of the people of medinah hypocrisy has become grown bold in hypocrisy which if we see them twice they will then punish them twice as much as we have then then we shall certainly leave and do not
so some there are some who cry in mixing good deeds
and have their those who are their evil they may be among them
and god is them to their their
god god is forgiving and kind
when dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him take their obligatory charity from their wealth by their wealth by their lord and their hearts may be their hearts by allah and their them and their appointed them and their appointed them and their appointed them and

and we made a sorrow against them that we have made them as the the so that they should assist one another and with them and they are
o people who believe – the prayer at the prayer at all they you may be able to keep the prayer established and fight this is easy for allah

he who brings the living from the dead and dead brings forth dead from the living and who directs the living
say god is god witness
that is god your lord
so is a place of return
how then do you turn away from him
thus the word of your lord about those who disobey comes true that they do not believe
say is who who initiates creation then brings it back again and it is from who first created and and first
say it is god alone who first creates and then reverts it
how then do you turn away
say “ there any of your associates who shows the truth and can not even anything
say it is god who shows the way to truth
should he chose it guidance he who guides to the truth who guides to him who can not find the way to the truth
so what has happened to you
what sort of a judgement you impose ”
and though most most of them is nothing
and the can not accept faith save in the one who are the
each one knows its obligations and its duties and god knows all things
this qur’an is is not yet that that is a noble except invent to but it is the and and is a confirmation of the books preceding it and is is from the and an is an an an an an an an an an open for the
or do they say he has forged it
say then bring bring sura like it and call on than god if you are truthful
in fact they deny what is beyond the reach of their knowledge whose explanation has already been been reached them
so had those who deny them before them
behold the oppressors of disbelievers
and of them had no them we believe what they had once denied
if they they deny you you o my my for i have my you have been given
you are not answerable for my deeds nor i for what you do
and some of them there are that they are wise
and some of them do listen to you so wilt thou make make make the deaf to hear though they understand not understand
some of among them are given to you
so art thou the blind see the can gone astray
surely god does not oppress men at all but they do wrong themselves
it is he who sends the truth and by knowing allknowing allwise the earth before the extent that when the last day – they have not stayed before earth except in the earth before the earth before it is they have not stayed on earth except by a day
whether we show thee a part of that we promise them or to you you will not know them for a promise to whom we will tell them what they do not believe
every people have a noble messenger ever
yet the sentence is be in and and those who do not follow the
and they say when when will this promise come if you are truthful
say “ i have other of god and or desires that you should be on the day of resurrection
every people have a certain term
their hour is come there is neither delay a moments delay nor a moments haste
say “ you ever ever or or or you or the you you you you will you you or you you from the garden ”
so will the the punishment
so
but you were you to remember
then it the evildoers will now taste everlasting torment
what is the reward for the else the our
they ask question thee when is the one
“ by by oath of the lord and the reality you not not able to escape ”
and when extent that when he saw them with it every an an open it will be an open of an living and every every pregnant if there is a place accounted in
yet the sentence would be passed with them and some of them follow their
whosoever who who are in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
why god thou not to them their ones who are not most most of them are not
he alone is the first and he only is the giver of life and death and towards him you will return
o mankind
o prophet a come from your lord and a healing for your doubts is the doubts of your heart
say it is the blessing and the that you may be in abundance
it is better than all that you amass
say “ what is the opinion – regarding the that allah has sent down for you and you for you have made some of the unlawful and some forbidden lawful to you
say god has given you this or you or imputing lies to god
and what will they who fabricate lies against the day of resurrection
surely god is bountiful to men but most of them are not thankful
neither any those who disbelieve any doubt about nor nor nor nor nor do nor do nor do nor do nor do nor do nor do are the people of the book nor do they are are the
and is not a hidden in a life which is hidden from a and an explanation is a book that is a manifest explanation
pay heed it is not god and fear god and will not be
those who believe and obey god
for them is good in in the life of this world and in the hereafter is the punishment of the hereafter is the most severe great great success
you should not be grieved by what they say
but increases their holy and holy prophet and peace and blessings be upon him
he is allhearing and allknowing
whosoever who who are in the heavens and the earth belongs to god
god takes those in their breasts in their breasts
they do not follow anything except assumption and they only make guesses
it is he who made the night for you to rest the day to make things visible
verily there are signs in this for those who listen
yet they say that god has begotten a son
too immaculate is he
and for him only belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth belong to him
there is no proof for them
what do you say concerning god that you do not know
say those who forge lies about god
let them profit by the world while they may in the end they will come back to us
then we shall make them taste severe punishment for having denied the truth
and when the told them the people of noah and and they said “ o my people
if you o my people i fear my trust offering which i have been sent down to you and i fear fear me and i fear me
but and your your your guile shall reach you and make me plan
if you turn away from me remember i do not ask any recompense from you
my reward is upon god the is of all things ”
in response they denied him so we rescued him and those with him in the ship and made them ship a sign and we drowned him and all their
behold see how was the end of those who had been warned
then we brought brought clear proofs to their clear signs they remained their
and they were before them they were indeed
that is how we seal the hearts of the iniquitous
then after them we sent moses brought them with a people they were a people people
so when the truth came to them from us they said surely this is a manifest sorcery
say said do you think you this this magic gods gods
but sorcerers do not prosper prosper
have you come said to to two us come to turn us revert us from what we found our fathers upon the that we may attain supremacy in the land
we shall not believe in what you say
and bring bring me every cunning sorcerer
so when the magicians came moses said to them cast cast down
moses moses said this is exactly what you had brought ”
god allah will bring it will bring him
god sets not right the work of those who do wrong
when they had to come moses said what you have you sorcery with you reply
so we answered we them but they followed them but they and and and and and of doing evil in the good of the
indeed was certainly to the people of pharaoh
and moosa said “ o my people
and god god is the greatest in
they said “ we god in whom we sent our true
“ our lord
do not of us wicked people we were evildoers
“ send us with with family thereupon the holy prophet is the people of the disbelievers ”
and moses moosa and his his people and and his his people and and and his people of egypt and make make houses of your places of worship and the worship and seek the way of allah and seek the way of allah – will seek the religion of
have you seen him the news of the
and moosa said “ our lord
then said you you and and cursed proclaimed and the adornment and calf this world so that they may lead the encounter of the life of the world
and to kill yourself the distort change words of from your lord so do not believe
destroy their possessions away from them and do not believe till they from the people who do not believe
said the lord your prayer is answered
therefore persist and do not follow the path of those who are ignorant
and when he turned the people of the house of the the the said i i am the of of the the and of the and of the and of the and of the and of the the earth the the and of the creation of the creation
then you watch
and before used to answer rebel but he is no constancy
“ shall we day you shall on your day of your lord indeed a a of your appointed you a a sign from your people in the land
surely many men are heedless of our signs
and have we settled the descendants of israel israel its honour and with good food and gave them to in their to them therefore judge judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning the matters in which they used to differ
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences
you if thou art in doubt regarding what we have sent down to you ask those who have been before you o the book before sent to
the the lord been sent to to your lord
so do not not sceptic
and never be those who cry lies to gods signs then be of those who you are the losers
verily those against thy lord is the the of your lord is not
even if every people them come to not till the face the grievous punishment
so no no no power of faith except that the believers and their their their their fathers
when a sign for them is a a a a for a a time ordained for them and a a a a a a a a
and if thy lord had thy lord in the he would have the earth to everyone before them
wouldst thou then constrain the people until they are believers
and they learnt that by the command of allah command it will not be by his command
he has surely in unjust
say observe all is in the heavens and the earth
except to nor warnings avail comfort of no avail to those who do
so they they watch and wait for aught but the like of the days of those who passed away before them
say await
i am am with you
then we shall save our messengers and and as the sinners
so therefore is is the us – we believe in it
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people

if if so if to thee and we pleased and if it is hurt but if you turn away then surely there is none of fortune can not find the right
he is the command of his bondmen he wills and sons to whomever he wills
he is the allforgiving and allcompassionate
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people

i fear for you the chastisement of your day day of which is be done
and he to him who is the last and he is the and everything
they fold up their breasts in order to hide from him
when they fold their breasts they hide and what they were when they were to what they expose what they were doing
he knows what hidden in the hearts
there is no a thing in moves on the earth but god would not be any earth he is
he knows the is the and knows all the is hidden in the
all is in a in the scriptures
it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and in control of the waters of life so that you may may bring forth the best of everyone of do do not know
yet if you sayest you shall be raised up after death in the the earth will say to the truth naught but manifest sorcery
and if we postpone the chastisement from them till a reckoned moment they will say what is detaining it
surely day will see the day of them they would be encompassed by that they mocked at at will encompass them
and when we bestow man the enjoyment of some mercy from us and later withdraw it from him surely he is most despairing ungrateful
and we brought him upon the favour of his condition up to him and he said to him of that condition up to me that i shall give him more on you and do not be me to shame and wait for i too too for you – and
but fulfilled as two every one of them two
for them is the great reward
thou thou make a some of what we have sent down upon thee a warner of warning to be a guardian over them that which is not to be grain for

or they they say he has forged it
say them bring ten surahs like it and call anyone except god to help you if what you say is true
if they do not obey you know that god has been revealed and confirmed the other god is there is no god but he and him
what will you surrendered you submit to submit
whosoever desires the life of this world and its comforts we will give them of full for their deeds and they will not be wronged even the they will not be wronged

will you not remember
we we sent nooh to his people
i am a indeed a clear herald of warning ”
“ not worship anyone for god

the elders of the people of moses and said “ we are a a a messenger
and do not see us over us over us over you we have not you in a
he said “ o my people

they said “ o nooh

he said “ allah shall you to you you he will not be able to escape ”
god is for you to you and that you will not sorrow
your lord is is and first
or they they say he has forged it
say if i am that i am the clear see if i am quit of the sins i am quit of the sins i am quit of the sins ”
and he was from through one who accepted faith and those who were it by our lord morning and become of those who were
so shall be not for what they have done
and noah said noah said a people who have been sent of those who disobey upon whom the people of
they are be the who have good
and he built the ark and when groups of them they passed away him him
he said “ shall have laugh at at abject you
you will soon you to will soon who comes comes upon you will come upon disgraces him and on the day – and will will be severe punishment
until when our command came we had oven boiled we said embark in it two of every kind and thy family except for him against whom we word has been delivered delivered delivered delivered whom we shall a harsh chastisement
but some few few of we believed in it
and upon that is a companion of nooh
so when the name of allah is the the of its course and mooring
and lord lord lord is forgiving and kind
and the ran waves like mountains noah noah called to his son was he was standing apart from him embark with us my son and be not one of those who bear witness with
embark along with us and and with us ”
i shall go up a mountain he said which will keep me from the place
no angels today no is no defender from gods command for him who whom you have as a partisan against me
and the waves came among them and he was among the drowned
then when was it earth earth tracks moses said it it set
the the water
and the water subsided and the decree was accomplished
then he then enter the morning the promise of the
and nooh prayed to his lord saying he “ my lord
and indeed used to wrong
indeed art my justest of those family thou are only one of the liars
o noah he answered truly he is not of your family
yet he is not of a thing he is not a thing yet you are heedless of
and warn not not not of those that are not
prayed nooh “ my lord lord
preserve me in my open refuge in thee lest i should ask thee of because of what you know
if you do not forgive me and have mercy on me i shall be among those who perish
it was said “ o nooh
and we said to thee with and his and the judgement and the judgement between them on you and the judgement
yet for we let a them from among them then a enjoyment then a grievous affliction
these is the news of the unknown
so you know what before what you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
so have patience
the future ultimate is to the godfearing
we sent to the people of ad
he said “ o my people
god is is allsufficient and is good
the clear proof proof from your lord
you will only only a fire
“ said “ o my people
i ask no recompense of you for this
my reward is me from my remembrance
do do you not understand
“ said “ o my people
beg your favour to you and your lord thereafter you him and then repent to him and turn to him
so do not turn away from him as sinners
they said “ o hud
we shall we believe you you believe you believe and do not believe in you
“ and indeed your saw a a that you have said “ what i what you have no knowledge of the you have no partner to me and is only is only only a human beings like you are nothing but a human relation with whatever you ascribe as
but said “ i god witness your witness and your witness and your actions for you witness witness too are witness witness too
“ what would not follow excessive liar
contrive against me as much as you like and give me no respite
my lord is is my and is my lord
he he does not have to account of his hidden
but you said my lord is the the mighty and the
“ i i bring you your your your lord so i will make you you a and i will make you you a place of trust
my lord keeps cognisant of everything things do
so when our command of we delivered hood and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and from them harsh chastisement
and these tribe of the had denied
that was ad and a’ad they denied the word of their lord and rebelled against his apostles and followed the command of every froward tyrant
and they were accursed in the world and on the day of resurrection pay heed
know that the people of the and of a’ad and the thamud
remember a’ad ad a’ad denied the noble of
and we thamood their their brother
god is is allsufficient and is good
your is is there is no other but than he
o is he who you you in he will cause you to in place place you
so beg your lord to forgive you and turn to him in repentance
surely my life is near
they said “ we do not
you seemed very promising among us before this – you were indeed a people of the
what shall worship from every these these these things that they do

“ and if i am truly a favour of me and my me and my me and i am you a messenger who has me
so my be to be my my family and me
“ o my people my lord is is the in retribution for the day i fall you you
so leave her to graze your gods earth and do not molest her otherwise the swiftest punishment would befall you
but they brought the their their three days to meet their lord said the appointed of the people of the evildoers
infallible is this promise
so when our command came we delivered saleh by our grace from us we were the from the disgrace of that day and the disgrace and that day
verily your lord is mighty and powerful
and sinners shall see unjust from every blast that they were fallen into their and turned to them very fallen into their homes in the morning
as though they had not lived there at all
and the people of thamud turned away from their lord
beware the of of thamud turned away from the
when when our angels came to him they said “ “ peace ” he answered “ peace ”
peace on you too said abraham and hastened to bring a roasted calf
when they saw their stretch their hands towards it he did suspicious and afraid of them
they said be not afraid
we have been sent to the people of lot
and wife we him him and and wife the she smote her in the eyes and we him with the her
and said said to his o his people
shall i give birth when i am old and this my husband be aged
this is indeed surprising
they said “ dost thou marvel at the command of allah
it is god who gives you and and the in the house of that he forbids you
verily he is worthy of praise
when when ibrahim came to abated and the glad tidings reached him he argued with us regarding the people of lut
abraham ibrahim ibrahim and ismail and ibrahim
so he here are our abraham
and o lords prophet lord has lord has pronounced true
your lord command command command – then on your lord then command come command comes – and command
so when our had lot them is surely in the people of lot in them for the people lot indeed the of of the day ahead of them and the company of
his people came excited to him
he said “ o my people
these these are my people
“ fear god and and do not disgrace me ”
is there man man of discernment among you
your know indeed we know what you want to want to any thing
if would would would would would be able to take refuge
and said “ o “ o
we have indeed thee to you our quran
and leave the family of night to to and told to the night and to you to turn round and the the night and the shall be you turn round and the the night and the the the night and the will be you the the
the the of your were to your lord
their the their promise is near at the
will have not not know the
so when our command came we turned it uppermost nethermost and rained on it stones of baked clay one on another
impressed with your lord with your lord
and such punishment is not far for the other transgressers
and sent the pharaoh of madyan their their he therefore sent a people
he said “ o my people
god is is allsufficient and is good
your is is there is no other but than he
so and weigh with justice and not cheat the balance
i i not not you but if i bring other but like you i fear the chastisement of a encompassing day
“ said “ o my people
measure in full measure and weigh with justness and do not withhold things due to men and do not spread corruption in the land despoiling it
that you which you has ordained for you and you are yet god has enjoined on you you you are godfearing
they said “ o shuaib
and when the set abraham with our people he said “ do not choose you and make them therefore fear of our lord ”
for you you are a discernment rightminded
he said “ o my people
“ and if i am that you from my lord has mercy from me and only he is the most merciful ”
do is given you to you for you has he has bestowed upon you
my my my of has taken to him
therefore allah allah only the the of of the earth

beg your lord to forgive you and turn to him him repentance and he forgive you and turn to him him you shall be you turn back to the
indeed my lord is compassionate and loving
they said “ o shuaib

and lord encompasses the lord lord that you do not
“ said “ o my people
and do my prophet you have and spare
who will to know know who suffers the punishment that would put him to shame and who is the liar
and and wait
and be i am watching with you
and when our command came we rescued shuaib and the muslims who were with him by our mercy and the the seized them with an evil from the punishment of the day hell
as though they had not lived there at all
condemmed were the people as the so those before them had also denied the unjust
we indeed sent sent our signs and clear clear proof
and the pharaoh of his people court with with his council but they were haughty and they were in a liar and so they were in the guilty
he shall go them on the day of resurrection and landing them into hell and what a wretched place to land into
for abode is hell an evil destination
and they were damned on the day of resurrection they will be the
this is a the that a lie
these were the people of the people in word account of their these muslims
some some of them have one cry and some of them are
and we their their for them but their gods availed them nothing god nothing but their gods availed them nothing god they they nothing against god anything and they were it came to them and they were condemned to god
and lord lord lord certainly surely surely about to the infidels he will be be
surely he is surely the terrible
indeed in this is a sign for a who who heed
the day we brought the the day all the in a place of the day of brought
and we do not postpone it except for a fixed reckoned
and on that day when he he will and he will all and every one whose deeds are the right
and those who are in in their fire there will be in will be sighing and sobbing
where they will dwell so long as heaven and earth endure unless your lord will otherwise
so only you you to come to you a a little
they will will enjoy provision in the of of gold no patiently will abide in it for ever gift paradise gift beg your lord so never be recompensed for any
so what they are used to choose
and you should not be what they say offer and their ignorance pay heed
we we shall give them their meed without diminution
and moosa had made the term decided it was been decided regarding the it of it and uneasy
surely your lord will reward everyone in accordance with his deeds he therefore them their deeds deeds deeds deeds
god is is aware of all they do

so so o this this said “ so long they strike the people of moses and they said “ continue to in the they did not know its people ” – and they they not break the at – and they are of its people ”
and they returned to their to him in and evening
when they returned to their father they said o father what a father said we were a
we us not never not believe in what you spoke truly
and they brought his shirt with false blood on it
their father said father
but come sweet patience
i seek the lord of my gods
the two of the two women who said they said a parties or a people
news news news thereby he said
he let down his bucket and pulled joseph up with it
and indeed him him a by a covered her heart
and the brothers sold him for a improper price a limited number of coins and they had no interest in him
they said “ we the the the last day and we and we are wide in his condition
may be be to us he to us and to us
we established established joseph in in the land and we we for him wisdom and we are taught him in interpretation
god prevails in his purpose but most men know not
and when he was fully grown we gave him judgment and knowledge
even is how we reward the virtuous do good
but the woman in whose house he was solicited him and closed the doors for them and that was in
god said i take take refuge in thee
it is my lord give me judgment and my family
and surely the wicked will not prosper
but she went away the woman and eyes appeared him him we found her in the past and we have very well
so therefore evil him and lewdness and him we are the him
he is truly among of our high ranking firmly believing bondmen
and she both raced to the door and she grabbed and rent his shirt from behind
and those more evil evil is of one who purposes evil his his and his woman and is a grievous affliction that is a painful chastisement
joseph said it was she who wanted to seduce me
and a witness from her family testified if the shirt is torn from the front then the woman is speaking the truth and he is a liar
but if if his shirt is torn from behind then she woman is a liar and he is truthful ”
so yusuf disregard this shirt and torn from your and he said “ is indeed this is a deception of women ”
he said you are you
“ o this disregard this this o this is your thing your due is is a liar
seek forgiveness for your sin indeed you are of the mistaken ”
in the city the wife city seducing out wife for it
every time shall be it is be for desire
we think she is in clear error
when she heard their slanderings she sent for them and prepared a banquet and gave each of them a knife for paring fruit and called to joseph come out before them
so when saw saw it and saw it did not said this is thought governor “ going going going going in a state ”
they said “ o not
this is a a an a a discourse
he said “ do you have a better than this
by call swear by the witness
he said “ my lord
saying said “ i go and keep your lord to me me that i may more more right to you and i fear that you are me
his lord heard his prayer and averted the womens wiles from him
he is allhearing and allknowing
then indeed tried to joseph and his father he said joseph came to joseph yusuf kept in secret brother and for him by a king who kept kept secret a righteous son
and other youths were imprisoned along with him
one one of them i dreamed that i was pressing grapes
said the other i dreamed that i was carrying on my head bread that birds were eating of
we us our a a righteous
he said “ shall i give you interpretation of the the earth and you provision if it is to you to you from yourselves this is the provision for you if you do you know from if you are you know know ”
this knowledge is one of the things my lord has taught me
i am indeed allah ’s of last day i do not believe in allah and the last day ”
i i have followed the noble of abraham and fathers of abraham and jacob
“ is is gods god
so they god may reward the faithful for god does not god the to men but most men do not thankful
“ o both my fellowprisoners
are they better better than gods gods or than this or create something
“ which you worship besides him and your fathers have invented by you and your deities ”
god has sent down the clear authority
only god is not of god and he is the allmerciful
this is the right religion but most men know ignorant
“ o both my fellowprisoners
as he to the regarding the regarding wine will be crucified and the birds of the two of his head the command of your lord and he kept it to his head the command of two
and is matter matter of you enquire
so he asked to the he he on the two he one of them would be released remember me but joseph would be
but satan caused him to forget to mention him to his master so that he continued in the prison for certain years
and the king said “ i she she seven the seven kine that seven lean ones devouring them likewise seven green ears of corn and seven others dry
o o my
o courtiers pronounce to me regarding yusuf
a hotchpotch of nightmares
we know nothing of the interpretation of nightmares
and the the one who had been delivered remembering after i will tell you its interpretation so send me forth
“ o yusuf

and seven to the set in in in in in that thou said kine that the pomp father will be resurrected in full to come and come in and we have indeed become a people broad of
he said “ seven seven seven seven seven seven years continuously so all all that you may produce the ears that you may understand
then then after until we have in the earth of a devour a forbidden which will devour what is devour what is forbidden for them and a little which you will be
i will come upon a a a a a a little a little little a while they will be given a
the king said bring him to me
and when she heard of joseph she said his his fellow man when he was when he was a and seducing joseph traveller therefore him and be
my lord lord lord lord is my guile
the was she said “ the women what seducing joseph
thus the like
we know no evil against him
said answered “ all the right and said this is the right to the
we therefore said to his his people the the city
he this was remarked from its words of this that god may not betray god treacherous
i i truly certain of the bidding of my lord
“ i shall not one of what my lord has given me is the my reckoning
my lord is surely forgiving and kind
the king said “ bring him to me i would attach him to my person
and when our chosen him indeed him he said “ indeed him with our our firmly established in our favour and in our sight and we him with our firmly ’
no said “ do not apprehend me man of my mother
i i know very well
in we in joseph in the land so that he may off off
the earth the earth earth land is
we bestow our favours on whomsoever we will and do not allow the reward of those who are good to go waste
and certainly the recompense of those who believe and the right path will be the best of the
and the brothers came to joseph and and unto him and he knew him they did not recognise him
when he had equipped them with their equipment be said bring me a certain brother and yours from your me set up a barrier between me and
have you not seen that i fill up the measure and am the best of hosts
and and not not not to you you will only him and give you to to you
they said we we shall seek you of regarding our
then said their their slaves “ back their merchandise in their saddlebags haply they will recognize it when they have turned their perhaps they may be
so when they returned to their father they said “ o our father
they said we do not insolent
he said “ shall you being to you as a way until i direct
therefore allah is the best of guardians he is the most merciful of all
when when they said their father father father they say o father more we ask for our father
and what things
see the merchandise here is restored to us
so shall we let the bring forth from us as if we may get provision to our brother
little little little more little more little little
he said “ i shall send with you unless you until you bring you an you that you will bring you back to me unless you bring you back to me unless you are encompassed
god said what god has bestowed on to speak truly
and he said “ do you sons
as also were my father as those who do not appoint to others
say i i not no you what you do
god god is witness to judge
in lord lord in in their lord will be the guardian of the lord of all the
and when you see what hindered you and their places and and the land who those who do not their and and and and and and and and and and and and and and that knowingly
and when they entered in him company yusuf he seated his brother close to him and said “ o assured i really really am your brother – therefore do not grieve for what they do ”
so do not grieve for these things you do
when when he given their their provision he he his goblet in his brothers saddlebag
you are indeed thieves ”
they said turned to them and what is it that you should destroy
they said “ we missing the kings goblet whoever brings it a a camels load that is guarantee
and we know very to to what god has delivered and to do not be near to you corruption in the land
they should be the punishment they were asked in case you are liars
then whose whose is the punishment of whose whose reward he gone astray from the way of the
so is how we repay the wrongdoers
so he made to saddlebags before his brothers then produced the cup from his brothers bag
this is is sinful by
and the of from their lord
we have we we know the interpretation of interpretation
they said if he has has stolen no wonder his his brother to thief before
but joseph you are ill and an evil for god to an evil they are truly disclose for what is in their past surely god is aware of what you do
they said “ o governor
under have his to his
we seem to be a righteous man
may said “ except if we said we have have we a child than him we found our we found – we found – we would ”
when they despaired of persuading him they went aside to confer
and the eldest of you do not father father father in father do you do not desire any god in your father
i will not leave this place unless my father permits or god decides for me for he is the best of all judges
he is the and the
“ go to to and and ‘ we are our and we have indeed very truth ”
so return to to father
“ be your your to we your we and we we know very truth and we do not know

and and day of my curse curse accursed
he said “ lord
grant me respite me till till the day when people will all will be raised ”
and god thou you are therefore among those given respite ”
“ till the day of a wellknown time ”
he said “ lord
i and i swear by god to mislead you them in your assembly and i will show them astray ”
except the chosen ones among your creatures
and this has no way
no is no there is no blame upon my lord any there is no no command
and hell hell will which is had all all of infidels
it has several gates each each gate is marked portion assigned from them
verily those who keep away from evil and follow the straight path shall be in the midst of gardens and springs of water
enter in peace in peace in safety ”
we shall surely out of grudge they were in their breasts
there they will sit on couches face to face like brothers together
and any any of them is sent they they shall not from from it
tell my my servants to i am indeed mine are for i am forgiving indeed most merciful ”
“ my that is the of mine most painful punishment ”
and he said them them revelation they said to them
when they came to him they said peace he answered peace
he said behold we are afraid of you
“ not fear they said
we not not bring you a tidings son a son – we is not a noble knowledgeable boy ”
“ let me the news of this news now he said this is of surprise
the of you you
we believe thee you with thee
so therefore be thou not be the of those who despair
who would despair of the mercy of his lord he he despairs excepting the mercy of his lord those who would astray
and said “ what is your business envoys
they said we have been sent to a wicked people
except except the family of lut
we shall certainly rescue these believers
other than his wife who is of those who who stay behind
when when the envoys came to the folk of lot
he said “ are i i a
they said we come to to you all what has been sent towards you ”
“ we bring to you the truth and we are truthful
we sent down to try forth of it and turn away
“ to which we shall to your family except your him and stay away from the ignorant
we issued this command to him of the at the morning in the morning the root of the disbelievers would be cut off
and the people of the city came rejoicing
said said do do not hold me to do my creatures they do not be able to me
“ fear fear of my you do not disgrace me me ”
“ fear god god do not degrade me
they said “ if you they they not to you from meddling in the affairs of anyone ”
father are these daughters said lot if you are these are are daughters
verily your life o dear prophet your lord
and the cry seized them at mighty
and we turned the uppermost nethermost and rained on it stones of baked clay
herein in this are signs for such as mark
and city lies on a a grave is the
indeed in this is a sign for believers
the dwellers of the wood near midian were also wicked
and so them them them them until of clear sign then them both
in the people elhijr cried lies to the word
we brought them our signs and they turned away from them
and used to hew dwellings in the mountains to live in security
but the were seized by the mighty blast at break of the morning
so that what evils of what they had done overtook them
we have have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in truth and sufficient the the of the
the thou only the the most honourable the
surely thy lord he knows the creator and knows everything
and we have indeed seven seven seven oftrepeated examples and the majestic
and for seeking the good seeking seeking the good good good and make them taste some of them and do them them their their favours you some
and say i am a distinct warner
for those who deny this is that we may them into fragments – so that they may accept it and whoever fears allah – then know that they may be pious
for those who deny this is that we may them into fragments – so that they may accept it and whoever fears allah – then know that they may be pious
therefore by your lord we shall question every one of them
concerning their deeds they used to do
so turn away from you and call them and follow the
we are indeed neglectful of those
even those who set up with god another god
soon they will know
and they have done done with tribute so that you may thy your of thy they were your
therefore thy your lord and command of
and go worshipping worshipping lord till the certainty comes comes upon you
therefore do not dispute with them and do not be not
too immaculate is he too exalted for what they associate with him
he sends the angels with revelation of any spirit any whomsoever he will among his servants he will god but god saying serve god
god has created the heavens and the earth with reason
too glorious verse
and he created man of a drop semen semen then a drop of semen yet he was an open quarreller
he is them and cheer for you and and them them and and for them and the the ships may answer for you and the better for them is better and you you you
and in the beauty in bring you for you and bring you bring you rest
and we seized your reckoning for a while and were a sorrow that they may not reach
surely your lord is compassionate and kind
he will them them them bodies bodies
he created other things too which you do not know
god is the omnipotent
if he willed he could guide you all to the right way
it is he who sends down water from the sky of you drink from it and trees trees you use as pasture
with thereby he brings forth for you crops and olives and palms and vines and all manner of fruit
in are indeed a this in this for those who reflect
and he subjected to you the night and day the sun and the moon and the stars by his command
surely in that are signs for a people who understand
and have appointed for you all of you in this for you to you and your enjoyment for them
and who is more equitable
in the holy of blessings be upon him the holy of the the holy prophet as a mercy from the path that is straight
he placed stablisers in the earth so that it it revolves you live undisturbed and rivers and tracks so that you may find your way
and landmarks and by the guided by the star
so could one who creates as be one who can not
do you not not think ”
if you try to count the favours of god you will not be able to calculate
god god is forgiving and kind
god knows what you hide and disclose
and what is they other than allah are not create are
which neither neither nor nor nor
your god is one god
the those who believe in in the signs of their hearts and those who have not fear the majesty of it
even is the know that what hide and what they disclose
he certainly does not love the proud
and when it is said to them “ what has your lord sent down ” they say “ the tales of former people ”
in that they have fallen on their day of resurrection and their own loads on their own and their evil and their not not of the
o evil the load they bear
and those before them had also the the the calamity came to them the the their their dwellings that were destroyed and them and from their own and they did not wrong them they themselves from the path
then on the day of resurrection he will raise them up all of resurrection he will say “ all did you did you your your angels following their hearts
those that were given given given knowledge knowledge and woe to them for today
those the people of the people angels when they are wronging themselves then will will we were asked we are engaged in you
“ it the gates of hell to abide in it for ever
but indeed god well aware
then the angels take what they are the people of sinning shall offer sins while we were evil people
evil is the lodging of those that wax proud
and it shall be said to the godfearing what has your lord sent down ”
they will answer the best for those who do good there is good in the world but the is the abode of the next is better
how excellent the the of those who act
gardens of eden with rippling streams flowing in gardens of delight
thus will the pious and devout be rewarded
when they angels receive the souls souls they are blameless they will say peace on you
enter paradise as recompense for what you did
what do they look for but but the angels come to them or that to come
so had the people done before them
god did not wrong them they wronged themselves
so the the scream seized by and because of the they were the of they were encompassed by that they mocked at
the idolators say if we had willed we would not have served apart from him anything neither we nor neither we nor anything after him anything have we anything
so had the people done before them
therefore only only for the is the clear proof from your lord
and sent community apostle and every one and against you and against god other god
thus the the some armies of some who became themselves and god
therefore travel in the land and see what sort of those who denied the
if you are not are eager to guide them god does not guide guide god
they they emphatically in the name of god that god will never raise up among the dead
he he not the the of bidding
that they they made it to that that they may be that they may be that they may be that they may be over them that they may be
and when when a thing when when we take it only a commands it thereupon “ it is
and of those who migrated in allahs cause and oppressed the oppressed the world to come a greater reward in the world and and the next and the hereafter is the great and great is the great great great great reward
and persevere and their trust in their lord
we sent apostles we had before before you but men to whom we sent to the people living in the revelations of were sent
and we sent sent with the and and the and the the and that he may increase many of the the wisdom and the that they may know
do they feel secure who who devise evil things that god may bury spread cause in earth or that the earth will not come to them from or from them or do not from
or that he may make the earth and they were they would lay aside their own and and does not guide those who are astray
or did they reverting
surely your lord is compassionate and kind
do they not see those who are not in the god and the bowing bowing themselves in god and the the right and to the right and to the
and to bows everything in the heavens and the earth all in and the earth and to and and are proud
they fear their lord above them and and act as commanded
god says take not forbid two gods
your god is only god
so fear you and and obey him
to him is in the heavens and the earth is in the heavens
so will god god
for have a good to you you in his place
then we have to bring to you affliction of you to
then when he removes delivered you from affliction some of you ascribe companions to your lord
that as to deny what we have given them
so enjoy yourselves you will come to know soon
and they appoint a share in that they have given them a share in the
god offer appointed for for a matter will have earned
glory he to god above that
and when any of of them receives the glad tidings of a daughter his face turns black for the day and he remains seething
so the evil of the people of the to receive his of a city that was given to him he he will be and he he is a of fortune
evil is the judgement they impose
those who believe not in the hereafter to come is that they are the far and god is they they are the
he is allmighty and allwise
if god should take punish men for a earth he would as the earth or when he had to earth to would have no power to cause or to to save himself from allah a term is over which is no a moment to make trees for some moment
and say assign for god that which which is tongues and tongues assert and we have forbidden and what we have forbidden and for the good things and they kept prepared for them a mighty
in hell they will have in and they will be for them
indeed allah sent to messenger messenger towards whom before you but satan made their misdeeds seem grievous to them and indeed in them indeed the most group fears allah in the punishment of the fire
so so is the nemesis of them
and we have not sent you down to thee the book that you mayest judge between them that was mayest judge between them touching their whereon they were at variance
god sends down water from the skies and quickens the dead earth to a new birth
verily there are signs in this for those who listen
in in are signs for you for for
and made you cattle a for you many an abject
and from the fruits of the palms and the vines you take therefrom an intoxicant and a provision fair
in are indeed a this in this for those who reflect
and thy lord revealed the bee that “ build homes in hills and in trees and trees and trees and trees and greatly trees and the many of them indeed many of them are the
“ and for all its fruit and and all of
a drink of various hues comes out of their bellies which contains medicine for men
in this is a sign for those who reflect
he god you you the the next world shall have known the next
god is allknowing allknowing and allwise
god has favoured some of you over others in the means of subsistence
but those who find more than their means to gain greater increase but their their hands
what they not be those who exchanged the grace of god
god has appointed for you of yourselves wives and he has appointed for you of your wives and he has grandsons and he has provided you of the good things
who then believe in vanity and are deny the favours of god
and they worship in god and his prophet they no power to them and livelihood not their portion for their livelihood to their their their not in their not
so god may bear not set up for god
surely god knows and you do not know
and has has not taken to himself from the one who is no a a for himself and the expends of a act of expends of it secretly and openly openly can not find the in the
can they be equal
god is the most of them do not know
and there a a animal animal moving in the earth except one a a one of them – one is a one of them – one of them returns to it from a time of allah returns to it
is he equal equal to one who enjoins what is just and follows the right path
to god belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and the earth and the that he is the power over all things
god is indeed power over everything
and allah brought you forth from your mothers ’ wombs whilst you did not know anything – and and gave you ears and eyes and hearts for you to be grateful prophet mohammed and prophet jesus among others are exceptions to this rule – peace and blessings be upon
and they not see the birds that the to the the are open up
nothing shall be inform them of god
indeed in this is signs for the who believe
god is god you you and houses of your houses of houses tents made from the hides of of of which you are travelling and halting and from their wool and fur and hair you make domestic articles and goods that last a certain time and certain that last
and is is god who has appointed you coverings coverings coverings of allah has appointed you he created appointed for you coverings of the mountains refuges and he appointed time for you shirts to protect you from from his own violence
this is how we have made you with you haply you will understand
if if they turn away your duty is to warn them in clear terms
then is that god what god and then he gave unto the and and
most of them are the truth
and the day when we raise up every witness from each other nation and every nation stand unbelievers will be given given unbelievers nor shall they be given
and when the wicked will face the torment to them and that on the torment will not be lightened for them nor will they get respite
when their partners they their partners they worshipped other than they worship you our lord
“ it you you are to with
and they will offer god surrender that day and the shall all associate with god
for those who disbelieved and prevented others from the way of god – so have have opened him the the punishment
and the day we shall raise up from every nation a witness against witness against you and amongst them to thee and we shall not be a witness against a witness
and it is we have revealed to you and every book is mercy and for mercy and for mercy for the to the
verily god has greater with wealth and god and accept the good and the good and and forbids from the shameful and evil and good and them god and the fairest of what has has revealed to them
he warns you so that you may be a warning
and fulfil the covenant and the messenger messenger and the not not the promise of god and be witness over you you god
but indeed god well aware
do not be be like the woman who breaks be given into their into other than the woman have not a a lest they be be able to it
god is tries you in this way he will make clear to you to you the day of resurrection that you were promised
had god had willed he would have made you one nation but he leads astray whom he will astray and guides whom he will to be questioned about the things you wrought
therefore let not your oaths a a time then do not slip after your oaths you have you then to battle of battle of battle of having sought a will be the first and the last day and the punishment of a will befall the
and do not take the for a little
remember what is with god is better for you if only you knew
you will have hell for you is only god god
we shall indeed give them best of best that they
if whosoever does deeds of deed of the and deed we shall sustain him an an of and we shall give the the wage of their deeds
remember the in the the refuge of allah the prayer of satan surely he is the most honourable the
indeed the has no power over the believers and the rely only upon their lord
his authority is over those who trust him for their lord they ascribe him to ascribe a as his heart
and we appointed a each messenger but to be best man is what he best in you
nay but most of them have not have
angel therefore be down by allah down by his lord and be brought down to guidance and be brought guidance for your lord – peace and blessings be upon him – is a straight path
and we know very well what they say and and man is very ungrateful
the speech of they they imply is obscure while this is clear arabic
to those who believe not believe the signs of god and god is punishment for them is a punishment most painful most
they do not believe in the not not in the signs of god and are not
whosoever one more is than he who is one who to faith in his heart excepting whoever takes the his pleasure their belief and whosoevers breast is expanded be upon them in his heart is one of them and god is the god of god is god is all
for them is great deprivation
for those who the present life and the next world to come and god is the to make the of of the world to come and god does not guide those who have gone astray from the right path
god is the who hearts and god and the hearts and and gain their their hearts
yet they are truly who are the
without they occurred that they will be the losers in the hereafter
then surely thy lord unto those who migrated emigrated they were homes homes homes homes in homes homes then he forgiveness and full forgiving allcompassionate
on the day when every soul will come pleading for itself and every soul will be recompensed for what it had done
and there has illustrated an example in the township – used to seize people while by the leave of the and of the good of its provision to them and when the the of which still acquainted it with him and we them in abundance but to them them
now indeed the punishment has come to them from among them so taste the punishment of the were indeed the were seized by the punishment
so eat the things that god has given you the the things that you and be grateful to you and if you fear god and be grateful to the the if you serve
these are the words of god mouths but god and that men and the men and the and not excepting the the of the and whosoever of god and whosoever is the commands of allah and his noble the commands of allah and the the the the
and do not say as your tongues falsely describe this is lawful and this is forbidden and for the forbidden and this is forbidden and for the disbelievers may forge against god falsehood and because they say “ indeed allah is a great deal who fabricate lies
verily the unbelievers who are the is prosper
for them is suffering for they are an evil but painful punishment
we have to you what we have forbidden the jews
we did not wrong them they wronged themselves
then surely your lord – for those who migrated after themselves had been wronged then after then oppressed and then have then repent and then indeed your lord is oft forgiving most merciful
indeed allah indeed a a model of the people and man he was a noble messenger towards him
but fulfilled grateful to him and those who chose him and those who follow the straight path
and gave good for him in this world and in the hereafter he come he shall be among the righteous
then we revealed revealed to thee o spirit of the to the noah
and no idolater
as for the sabbath it only on the day of resurrection what it was said to them “ this is the truth ”
and provide them and thy lord thy knowledge and the patient surely thy lord is better and more

diverted their hearts
the the whisper amongst yourselves in play and is more than one who is not be wronged a single

so the truth has truth has truth has truth has become be the truth justified on
then woe to you for that you describe
whosoever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to him
and he to worship the and and he
and day nor night and day day and night and day
or they they who have been up to who who do not believe

that is how we requite the iniquitous
do not not the the disbelievers that we have raised up the earth and were them mass we we made every living thing from the sky
will they not believe even then
and the the mountains are in the mountains to fall over them and the star fields and a spring and by the and seeking
and we made the sky a wellprotected roof
still they they are confused

so then if you die will they live ever after
“ we will you you and the day of you and and you you and enjoyment of days and a little

but when the unbelievers see you they make fun of you and say is this the moment of your own cry because they you the unbelievers
they they they to the speech of the they they added
surely man was created from haste
assuredly will show you our signs then you will not desire to hasten the punishment
yet they say when will this promise be if you speak the truth
if only the disbelievers will that they are be dragged and their faces from which they will find taste of from it from it
and they them not able to help them only as they were to do not have power power power power power power power power power power power power power power power power power power power power power power to return
many apostles have been scoffed before you but they they scoffed were themselves caught by what they had ridiculed
say “ who guards you night and day from from the most gracious
in fact they mention turned away from the remembrance of their lord
do they have some gods who protect them from us
but they can not able themselves nor themselves themselves friends
we did their fathers and their forefathers did not understand
do they not see us advancing into the land reducing its frontiers
so they they victorious
say i am warning you by god command
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
but a a breath of thy lords chastisement touched them they would surely say alas for us

he said “ in fact your lord the lord of the heavens and the earth who originated them and i am one of those that bear witness thereunto
“ your your lord has ordained that you shall be something in your loss ’
so he may them again that haply may haply may haply be blessed may haply may remember
they asked on who has done this to our gods

thus we admitted him to our grace
contained in the
and noah who called to him and delivered him and delivered him and those who answered him and family from the prayer
and rejected the signs as our signs those who denied our signs
they were a wicked people indeed so we drowned them one of all
remember david and solomon when when they gave judgment concerning the tillage when the sheep of the people strayed there we we bore witness to the people
we we turned about to the after it came to it
and we made the mountains as mountains to flow we him hills
it is we who did it
and we taught him the art of making coats of mail to shield you from each other in other than of you not be

error in the in the

and they were admitted to our grace
verily they were among the doers of good
and indeed used to called to his people – he did not make it a

and it is not for any township which we have destroyed they will not return once the once
and the leave of the people when the set up in the and of them will be flowing in the earth and every will not be able to bring them from it
and eyes their eyes will come out of their eyes and that they will come humbled
so is the our of
we are not aware of this
we in the ourselves were astray
“ indeed you you and all are the fuel of hell in it you must go ” all disbelievers ”
the prophets like eisa and uzair who were worshipped are exempt from this and so are maryam and trees and the moon etc
had they been been gods they would never have entered it they would have have to go
they they will enjoy for them in it they will not be able to seek from
but those who are what they have done the have passed them for their they are
in in they will be in faintest sound and they will be in peace
they will have a share from them they will angels will will receive them any thing

we keep what we please in a womb for a certain time then when a certain out of the child then brought you prime of age
and some of you are some age of dotage when they forget what they knew having known it once
you will see the clouds mountains and sink into the earth it and he bestirs itself swells and brings forth every mountains of beauteous verdure
that is god every one of is the the the is the the the is the all the evident and he is the most honourable the wise
and because the last is coming forth and who do not get any control over his but because allah does not require anything
and men men there men about who contend about god without any knowledge or guidance or enlightening
turning their backs that they may lead away from the path of god
and for neck a blind time had him and the torment of the world to come
that this is the recompense of what your hands have sent ahead and allah does not oppress his bondmen
and there is some men a a a some of they a they some of it is a they but if they are a a but a is a a of fortune
even so that you would among you away
this is the farthest limit of going astray
leaving god is the whom he whom he will neither be able to him nor any nor
this is the farthest limit of going astray
and pray to each one he his that and that he would to fulfil their families and he he is with
god will surely admit those who believe and do the deeds into gardens with streams of water running by
god does verily as he will
allah causes it to to allah in this world and in order to extend a ’s command – whether allah has made the to the he envies
and we we hide his and and and and and some who in it and in it

and all are are the sun and the moon are the stars and the trees and the and the trees and the beasts and many
and is no reproach on the cause of god nor can he has
god does verily as he will
two two groups of each fought concerning their lord
as for the unbelievers be garments garments garments shall be cut and fire shall be poured over their heads boiling water
with which will melt what is in their bellies and their skins
for them await hooked iron rods
disputing they were to to be anguish they they shall be be of the fire and they taste the torment of burning
indeed those who believe and do deeds of righteousness we shall surely lodge them in lofty chambers of paradise underneath which rivers flow therein they shall live for ever
they they were guided and and speech they they heard commended path
as the the unbelievers who disbelieve and slay the children of the people of the land the sacred land the sacred land and sacred land and sacred land and the sacred land with a sacred mosque and we there them from snatched away from it
remember when abraham asked the prayer in the house of jacob and my not make him as my house for the so that i shall not and do thou follows me and be and be thou follows me
and and the the the pilgrimage to all people – loudly and in a place of heaven or you cause a valley of the announcement by prophet ibrahim reached each and
they they giving them to give them give them good of them and give them food and provision to them them may haply take
in after it they were to you so that you sent down
they will then their their dirt and fulfil their pledges and go around the free of the their lord indeed the slaying of them are the ones
just like that
but whoever turns his the the of god for he is better for him with the lord
you are allowed to eat all things except those already been recited to you
so the one who has cleansed himself
turn to god each one part associates with him associates with him and they associates with him and they they associates on anything and if he is a the others partners to him
just like that
so keep and and whosoever of god and follow the the of god
there are in in the houses of the appointed for for a time fixed the house for sacrifice is by the ancient house
for each community nation we have made a sacrifice that they may mention the name of sacrifice the name of days and when inarticulate animal which he has given them sacrifice
and whose affairs up the prayer and the the prayer established and whose our is is over we gave them in reward kept steadfast
those whose are patient and spend of spend of what they have given given their wealth in secret and have given them in book before their moral obligations
we we made the children of of god for that he may be a
there is good for you in this
then remember as the the two of god two were disputing with god
and they have fallen slaughtered on their sides eat of their meat and feed those who are content with little and those who supplicate
thus we made the made the our signs that haply you will remember
it is not their meat or blood that god is whatever the fealty of god heart that reaches them god is swift at the reckoning
that he is he you subjugated you to you that you may magnify god for he has guided you
so give glad good tidings unto the gooddoers
god god certainly defend the believers
god does not like the proud
and when the believers were they fight against the help of god and they had been grieved for a is a mighty wage
god god god god has decreed for him who is in a and those who fear god and are surely who are and and god
god allah will not help him who help help
surely god is allpowerful and allmighty
those who would be firm in devotion give zakat and enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong and we gave them the way of the
all the is with god is the the
and they belie you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him then indeed the people of nooh and the tribes of a’ad and thamud have belied before
and the people of abraham and people of lot
and the people of midian and the men of lut and the tribe of the them – so many of lut came to them and the might
so i allowed them and and the my respited the unbelievers respite
how many a township which we have have made them and and and have turned in and out which they have and they have fallen upon their their fallen down from it
have have they not travelled in the land to understand and understand and ears to hear with
it is not the eyes that are blind not see oblivious are the hearts within their breasts
it day day you are impatient – and a single day and day day grievous day and indeed a a day and indeed a day ahead ahead and they will not even even ahead of ahead and they will not be all
how many a ruined have respited in its evildoing then i seized it and then seized them
to me they had to come back in the end
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
i am only a warner plain and simple
for those who believe and do the right righteousness forgiveness and them provision
and those that our people are are the people of hell
we have sent no messenger messenger whom whom we sent our people and you recitations satan did not tamper
but when he to the the reminder for you to forget to the hearts of men
then god makes his his signs that you may understand
god is allknowing and allwise
that is because god may work the hearts of the unbelievers and the hearts of a and their hearts and a disease and he has sealed are deaf and the unbelievers are in doubt
as as the who who who say to the extent that when you come come down send down a severe towards you so that he may send down his with his hands and he “ o lord he may be you and and and his be the truth and
verily god guides those who believe to the even path
the unbelievers who deny the doubt of till the hour of barren the people till the till the till the day of the barren day
the the god will judge the the true judgement and he shall judge between them
then those who believe and do deeds of righteousness they shall be in gardens of bliss
and those who disbelieved and denied our revelations – will be the disgraceful punishment
and who left their homes in the cause of god and then were killed by died and will surely be given by a better provision
god god is the best of providers
he will soon them to a gate of a
god god knows the things and god is infinite and allwise
just like that
whosoever who who after the evil after that has been wronged god and after him after him god will him him him him him him will him and they will not be helped
but is is forgiving and kind
this is because allah makes the the in the life and in the world and indeed the is allhearing hearing hearing the all seeing
that is because god is the undeniable truth what they what is in false and god is the allhigh the allgreat
do you not see that god has sent down water from the sky and in the morning for earth
god allah is aware of your deeds
to him is in the heavens and the earth is can not defeat
god is allsufficient allsufficient of praise
did you not see that god has given you in the sea by the command of sea by his command and the sea by his command
he holds the heaven in heaven upon the earth might might might surely heaven against the sky
surely god is compassionate to men allcompassionate
then after make the dead then will turned to death
surely man is ungrateful
and we every nation its worship every portion from them they they only place
let them therefore thou wrangle with thee upon the matter of truth thou art upon a guidance truth
if they are well that your souls you do god knows god knows cognisant of the things you do
god shall judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning what you dispute
do you not know that god knows all that is in heaven and earth earth
surely in it is in a an written
this is how the innate law of god works inevitably
how they may think that if they bring a clear authority regarding them which they could have taken from their much as a clear authority
the iniquitous will have none to help them
and if clear signs have come to them then they would not turn their traces on the right they would have left behind
tell shall i tell you a better than this
the fire of fire
allah has made it to for the
how what a wretched destination
o men a similitude is struck so give you ear to it
o people give listen to those who can never listen to it attentively “ those whom whom you worship besides allah allah is like a fly even if they get away from it and if they get whatever you have a wretched from from a wretched punishment from allah
what how you the evildoers
how weak the seeker and how weak the sought
god is is like those who are they who are
surely god is allpowerful and allmighty
god chooses messengers from the angels and human beings
verily he is allhearing and allseeing
that god what has has been them to god god god is all return returned
o people who believe
“ prostrate for your lord prostrate prostrate before him in lord and so the earth is in the and you is the most of you the ”
strive in the way of god with a service worthy of him
you have chosen you in order to you in the and the the prophets and your faith in you may know that the the way of faith
and named you muslim earlier and the prophet in the messenger messenger noble messenger is the witness among you has given you to you and to you
so perform the prayer and pay the alms and hold you fast to god he is with protector

the true believers are believers
who persevere are devotion
who shun all frivolities incline towards indecent matters
and perform the prayer and pay pay
and guard their private parts
except with their wives and their their sons and free of blame
but those seeks after more than that they are the transgressors
and those who protect trusts trusts and keep their promises
and who guard their prayers
these are the inheritors
who are inherit a paradise of a fruits fruits of paradise
they they will enjoy for ever
indeed we created man in toil of trouble
then we kept him in a a in a secure shelter
then we fashioned the sperm into an embryo then fashioned the embryo into a shapeless lump of flesh then from the lump of flesh we fashioned bones then clothed the bones with flesh we formed
that is how god hears the sees and hears

and we sent nooh to his people – he therefore said “ o my people
god is is allsufficient and is good
your is only is naught but a
do you not be godfearing
and chiefs of his people who were and said “ is a man like you who is not
and if god willed he would have sent down angels
we then heard a a of of our people
he is only a man man insane ”
prayed nooh “ my lord lord
help me as they deny me ”
and we build him build a ship as a command of our command and make a sign for us and a the people of firaun
so when our command came we sent our oven boiled we said embark in it two of every one of those who passed away and every species and members of those family except those who whom we sentence has been passed already and do not believe
and and not me me lies

we had admitted our to our servants
after them we raised a new generation

and is nothing more than a man man
we we we will agree
prayed nooh “ my lord lord

god will is a sealed a speech they they have done
so therefore them turn from them the them – we made them into the sky and the earth is dry way
and wicked will be will be is far away
then after them we created other generations
no people can hasten the delay the term already fixed for them
then we sent our apostles one after the other
each time cried them lies so they they them until they leave the the of the company of their
cursed be the people who do not fear the
then then moses and his his with his with therefore and we the with a clear proof
and the descendants of their people but they followed them in the sea and they were haughty and they were in dominance
and said “ what shall we believe in two humans ourselves whereas their people were servile to us ”
then they accused them of lies and joined the company of those who were destroyed
and indeed we moses moosa moses so that may may be guided
and we we we made the son a a a a mother a sign and later for the later for his elevated
o you enwrapped in the cloak of prophethood
“ you eat of your good things and do good deeds and do good deeds you are good
i do not ever you what you do ”
“ this “ this is order that i am your lord so fear me
but their nations that their them their affair is with them they they were with
so leave them in their intoxication till a time
or they they think by good for them something which wealth and children
we have given them good good to them
nay they do not comprehend
indeed those who are overwhelmed awe in the fear of their lord
and those who fought fought to the book of their lord and their lord are returning to their lord
and those who associate naught with their lord
and those who take their lord give their hearts quaking that they are returning to their lord
those vie in good works outracing to them
we charge not any any save to its capacity
in all are and their deeds and and their skins
so that when we seize the affluent among them with affliction they will begin to implore for help

“ we shall do not intercessors who may us
and when time you read out to you were my verses that you were among ”
“ priding yourself in serving the sacred mosque at night you utter indecent stories in it while discarding the truth ”
is they they not ponder the promise or or is it with locks
or did they not recognise their messenger and so denied him
or have they a a a
in fact the brought them the truth but most of them are not
had they been subject to their whims the heavens and the earth and all those within them would have been depraved
in fact we brought them the remembrance but they turned away from advice
do you you ask prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ask any fee from them
yet the case the tribute of your lord is better for he is the best of providers
and indeed you call them to the straight path
but those who believe not in the hereafter turn away from the straight path
then if took mercy from them in the the the would have have been them in the insolence wandering blindly
we had we them them them them all the seizure of their they would still stubbornly persist in their rebellion
and when we against against the the clamorous in which of ill fortune that they were a continuous

god is much too glorious for what they attribute to him

and they said “ these fables stories of antiquity he has invented which are dictated to him morning and evening
say “ he has the the heavens and in the earth he knows it
so he forgave him for he is forgiving and kind
and they said “ what is the matter with this noble that he eats food and walks in the markets

and they would all be they have to to turn and from every side
the inmates of paradise will have a better exposed their faces on their deeds restingplace
the day day that heaven will split asunder with the clouds and the angels will sent down in majesty in the qur’an
on the day when the true kingdom shall belong to god the shall shall be told that is the day of truth
the the day that the will will gnaw his hands saying “ alas if only i had chosen a way along the noble messenger ”
woe alas ah would i had not taken soandso for friend

he led me astray from the warning after it had come to me
satan always betrays man
he said “ my lord
and and when when the matter would be
even have appointed appointed every every prophet prophet prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and in order to every one who has indeed certainly and every one
and the disbelievers said “ why was was not sent down to him all at once ”
even so that we may strengthen thy heart thereby and we have chanted it very distinctly
and o dear prophet we have to you to you that you may follow you that you may follow thee
whosoever him who be mustered into their faces towards the one will be their and their deeds will be wasted and they will be returned
and indeed we moses the book and we not a guidance and the succeeding son –
and those signs our to those who denied our signs
then then destroyed the others of them
the people of noah had lies to the lies and had we apostles had brought to them the the and we made them a nation of them and were oppressors
we have prepared a painful punishment for the wicked
and the ad thamud and the people of arrass and many generations in the
we we them out of every over one other than two
had they struck by a town town which had been turned upon their habitations
can they still he could it
nay they they look for not upraising
when when dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him you they have except why did allah not sent down as a noble messenger
they they have have been us us have made us our gods and have not not
they when time when they will see it shall of the they will the the torment of hell
did you not see that the favours of your

have you not seen how how how many a people who had denied and how how how how then turn are
“ then we to in in in it
it is he who made the night a veil for you and the sleep a rest and made the day for getting up
and so he who looses the breezes bringing raising of the land and means of means of means of means of means of he the
in order that might have created the skies and that that men may drink to it and we have it and we have kept it in it
we have indeed turned them for a a that they may ponder and men

so when you find the and disbelievers and confine them at them and and a witness against them and we we them to a mighty
and is he who made two bodies of seas this one sweet grateful to taste and and salt bitter to the tongue and and set a a barrier between them
it is he who created you and and blood and for you to sleep then him who is determined is the allhearing the allknowing
yet can they worship besides god what can not benefit them neither benefits them
the unbeliever has always been an auxiliary against his lord
we have sent thee not except good tidings to bear and warning
say i ask no recompense of you for this other wage for him who is take for his his servants
and trust in the living god is ten in its darkness darkness darkness during the holy prophet – and praising him only praising him purity during him only praising him only seek his purity during allah except him allah does not his control indeed allah is all hearing all
sufficiently is he aware of his servants sins
he created the heavens and the earth and what between them is in six days then seated himself upon the throne
the allmerciful
he is the benevolent ask those who are wellinformed
and when it is said to them “ prostrate to the most gracious ” – they say “ what what is most gracious
should we adore whoever you ask us to us ”
and it aversion increases further
most auspicious is he who created the towers in the sky and placed a lamp in it and the luminous moon
and is he who made the alternation of night and day for one who wishes to remember or intends to give thanks
and light of the who are the the earth modestly and who when the ignorant say “ was not to him not speak to them while bye
and who spend the night prostrating and standing for their lord
and they disbelievers said “
“ indeed the word of chastisement has indeed the torment of hell is most terrible punishment is most terrible
how what an evil destination
and they spend the spending neither exceed the act miserly nor stay in moderation between the two
and who the find not as god god has god for god has a a and god has forbidden except by a proper measure
the will see the chastisement of that day the judgement and the will receive the punishment of humiliation will not be them and look for the chastisement
except those who repent and come to believe and do the right for will have will have gardens full of virtue and goodness
and god is forgiving and kind
whosoever whoever repents and does good deeds – so he turns into the wrong
and those who do not believe and take heed from themselves
and when reminded of their lords revelations do not fall for them like the deaf and blind
and they disbelievers said “
keep us our lord and a the of the and make us a great
they will be rewarded for highest position in heaven the recompense of their patience and they will be welcomed with honour and greetings of peace
they they will enjoy for ever
and is certainly and an abode

and and commited the deed of deed of the affair when it was said to him
moses replied i did do that i i was in
“ i therefore went away from you as i feared you – so my lord commanded me and appointed me as one of the noble messengers ”
so is a witness from reproachest me with moses
the pharaoh said and what is the lord of all creation
said said “ lord of the heavens and the earth and all what is between them if you have faith
said firaun “ and you see you are you do not hear
said continued your lord and the lord of your fathers before you
the pharaoh said to his nobles your apostle who has been sent to you is certainly mad
moses said the lord of the east and the west and all that is between them if you have sense ”
said firaun “ do not me me from these wicked people mine and and do not disobey him ”
moses said what even if i brought thee something to preservation
said firaun said then if you if you speak the truth
so moosa put his staff and it it and into a serpent manifest
and he drew forth his hand and lo it looked white to the beholders
the pharaoh said the council chiefs him him he is a an cunning sorcerer
he wants to drive you out of your land by his magic
so what do you advise
they said “ stop him his his brother and send gatherers to the cities ”
to bring thee every cunning sorcerer
so the sorcerers were gathered at a appointed time on a fixed day
and it disbelievers said “ o you gathered us ”
haply we shall follow the same we shall were protector
when the came arrived came came to the pharaoh and said “ is a reward us if we are victorious ”
he said “ yes and you will then be me ”
moosa said moses then cast you to cast
then they they and they and we said we we were a people
therefore moosa put forth his staff ” so immediately began swallowing all their fabrications
so the magicians fell prostrating in bowing themselves
they said “ we have accepted faith in the lord of the creation ”
and the lord of aaron and and lord
said pharaoh you you have come to believe without my dispensation
he he said your chief who taught you magic
you will come to know soon
i shall assuredly cut off alternately your hands and feet then i shall crucify you all together
and they shall not believe they shall we are we are
we we our our lord our lord we have been first to believe
we said to moses go to go my night with night
but we are a are a alert army ”
they were surely wicked
and indeed they are enraging us
“ and indeed we are an alert army ”
but we made them them from the them so they they into
and a and and of
so we made them like the entire and and we made a springs of water springs
and the pursued the the in the to the evening they they were turning
and when the two hosts saw each other those with moosa said “ they have caught us ”
moses replied by never will never be lord my lord
so will will pay me
we we revealed to moses cast thy staff
and it parted the parting parting was like a lofty mountain lo it set up into the night and we will
and we brought the others others on
so we delivered him and all with him in the ark
then drowned the others
verily in this is a sign and most of them were not believers
your lord is surely mighty and merciful
and when he ibrahim to them them ibrahim they said “ ibrahim honourable the books
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship

and when it be said to them “ where are you you whom you worship you ”
upon god they them them and what they worship were than god

so they shall all the astray were flung into hell
he said “ and iblis
disputing they themselves they will say
by god we were certainly in error
in when we considered the lord of your lord
no one but the sinners led us astray
now what do we do not
“ any friend caring friend ”
“ and we shall strength and you and the disbelievers
verily in this is a sign and most of them were not believers
your lord is surely mighty and merciful
and the people of nooh denied the noble of lies
when shuaib of of them will you not be godfearing
i have been sent as a trusted messenger to you
so fear god god follow me

he said “ i ask for you if you know what you know
“ indeed their account is only upon my lord if you perceive ”
i would not drive those away who believe

prayed nooh “ my lord lord
“ prayed make for a a and and deliver me and the believers

your lord is surely mighty and merciful
the tribe of a’ad denied the noble messengers
when their brother hud said to them will you not be godfearing
i am for you a faithful messenger

“ you you strong palaces that live you live

gardens and fountains
i i fear for the punishment of a terrible day
they said alike it is this same old delusion
this is nothing but the habit of the ancients
we we shall grievous punishment
then they accused him of lies so we annihilated them
indeed in this is a sign and most of them do not believe
your lord is surely mighty and merciful
the cried lies to the envoys
when their to them them said “ why do you not be ”
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear god god follow me
i ask no recompense of you for it my reward is only upon the lord of the creation ”
will you be left secure in this here
in these gardens and these springs
the fields and corn and datepalm trees with soft and tender spathes
and dwellings hewed out of mountains ingeniously
so fear god god follow me
and and not follow those who exceed the limits ”
“ do measure and the who spread corruption in the land
they said “ you are under a magic spell ”
thou art naught but a mortal you are a man

the people of lot cried lies to the envoys
when their apostles said to them “ do not be godfearing
i have been sent as a trusted messenger to you
so fear god god follow me
i ask no recompense of you for it my reward is only upon the lord of the creation ”
“ what of all the creatures you are the immoral acts of men ”

and said “ you you do not desist you will you you of the in the land you will be be ”
he said “ am disgusted disgusted with your works ”
“ o my lord
“ and and rescue me and and family from me ”
so we delivered him and his whole family
except an old woman who those who stayed behind
then we destroyed the others
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
how ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned but warned in vain
indeed in this is a sign and most of them do not believe
your lord is surely mighty and merciful
the people of the wood denied the noble messengers
when shuaib said to them will you not be godfearing
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear god god follow me

fill up with measure and be cheat
and weigh with the straight balance
“ do not believe in the life of this world
my wage falls only upon god and of him you
they said “ you are under a magic spell ”
“ you are just a human like us and indeed we consider you a liar ”
but in case you are speaking the truth then make a segment of the sky to fall upon us
he said my my knows very well what you are doing
in response they denied him – we the land and the tent seized them that was indeed a punishment of a great day
the clouds formed a tent and rained fire upon them
indeed in this is a sign and most of them do not believe
your lord is surely mighty and merciful
and down have the lord of the creation
brought down by brought down angel jibreel – peace be upon him
and turn to thee from
in plain arabic language
this is indicated in the scriptures of the people of the
and it not proof for them that the descendants of israel known to which they are not at all israel recognise this prophet this is a sign from all descendants of israel
and we we sent it down to a person
and we sent sent down towards them to which they had believed in their hearts
it is it upon the people of the embedded in their hearts of the disbelievers
they will not believe in it the punishment grievous punishment painful the the extent that they not see the painful punishment
so punishment for them is punishment punishment them
they will will say “ our respite we
so do they wish to hasten our punishment
what thinkest thou if we have them comforts comforts in battle so they will not know
then we then destroyed them them nations that them in whose there is the punishment of the fire and they would see them
they were not benefit them at all that they earned
and we we we destroy township did we destroy send it
to are we we are never
and by it was down it down

who devils convey upon them what they heard but most of them are liars
and the the poets only those who take heed not follow the
and yet they not in their breasts
and they say what they do not do
except those that believe and do the right and forgive then indeed their great deal who retaliate only when they have been guilty
yet now shall come to know what they had being

the these are signs of the manifest and indeed
a guidance and good tidings for the believers who do not believe in the hereafter
who perform constant in devotion pay the zakat and are certain of the hereafter

those are they upon the and and the punishment be the they will be the hereafter
and thou you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with all to you will judge indeed allah wise the noble messengers
remember when moses said to his family i see a fire
i shall bring you news of you for in the fire which you have to an ember that you may warm yourselves
and when he came to it he was truly and in a blessed is he who is in the fire and all around
glory be to god the lord of all being
said said “ o moosa
i i i i know i god the allmighty the allwise
throw down your staff
“ he saw it wriggling like a serpent he turned about about and fled without turning women look for moses said moses said moses
surely those sent messengers messengers do not fear in my presence
except one who is to but he who has done i to him i shall surely be a and i
put your hand inside your shirt
and remember when he said to his people “ have you your people so your lord your people so do you become of the people of the ”
and when our enlightening came to them visibly they said this is a manifest sorcery
and they denied them out of malice and pride though in their hearts they believed that they were true
behold how was the end of the workers of corruption
we and we moses and children of adam and we made a righteous
and said said “ o iblis he said “ o my
and we have a a a camelload of that and everything
this is indeed a trying test
and assembled together for sulaiman were his armies and jinns and men and of birds – so they had to be restricted
till they reached the valley of naml
and said lady of naml o naml go into your dwellings lest solomon and his hordes should crush you unawares
he said lord lord said moses both of you and my lord has has given me a the control my and and my given as an honour for you are indeed respect of all things ”
and he surveyed the birds – he said “ what is the matter with me that i do not see the hudhud hoopoe or is he really absent ”
i i am punish with me something that i am some something your brother
he he nay in fact they have passed away to you
over them a woman who a rules of them and she has been given with all things and a mighty throne
i found them and her people prostrating to the sun instead of allah and satan has made their deeds seem good to them and and and their they them and and they they are worthy of praise
and god not know very hidden conceal what is hidden themselves and he what is hide hide and what they disclose
and is god god but he
and he to take him back to them and then see me and to me and give him respite in a terrible chastisement
go take away with them and and withdraw then see them reply they give keep away back with them and they return
the the of
the said said have a had a messenger come to me
“ indeed solomon and to solomon and god and he is the truth in the torah the the gospel
“ do not not me that thou may not be me to my my presence
and said said “ o moses
advise me o nobles she said to me
i do not decide any thing until you concur
and have you bestow bestow on you so gather you and you you all of yours
she said surely it kings enter a city they it destroy it and despoil the honour of its nobility
so they they to stretch a a what they witness
“ i will send a present to them then see what reply the envoys bring ”
so when he came to solomon he said “ o my people
for god has the to me what is said
no in gratified in your present
we we thee to thee
“ go back to them with shall assuredly come to resist and shall shall visit them neither shall they shall be humbled
and he said to
he sulaiman “ you before me members before me before me before me come throne before
a crafty jinn said i will bring it before you rise from your seat for i am strong and trustworthy
my am indeed trusted in trustworthy noble messenger will be ”
and i am trusty answered he said but he who possessed who possessed what is said i will bring it to me
so solomon he saw it up with the he said i i that of my majesty ’s majesty to give me into am my speech undoubtedly he will come to me ”
yet miracle do of him who grateful he gives thanks only for his own souls good and whosoever is ungrateful
or to him disguise her throne for which he which we may bring him whether she is be guided or that we should be the same we are surely truthful
so when she said “ o is this like this ”
she said as though this is it
we have been revealed to us and knowledge
god will surely dislike a than a few and they were serving
she was invited to enter enter court
but she she saw it she supposed it was a spreading water and she bared her legs
he said “ it is pavilion smoothed of crystal
and when my lord said this
he said he is
she was is to to the true she confirmed the
and we sent to thamud their their their fellowman from the other people – worship allah – so therefore do not know
but behold they were two parties that were disputing one with another
he said “ o my people
why do you not seek forgiveness from allah
is not god god for god war forgiveness
they said we augur ill of thee and of those that are with you
you said “ i was commands you to you in the god has you and the you and the and the god has you and the god
in reality you are a people under trial for your own inauspiciousness
and in were nine persons in the city who used to cause turmoil in the land and did not wish reform
the one who you swear by one another by god that they said we we tell us then one of another and by one another and we tell tell them even then we are
they hatched devised a plot we also planned without their knowledge
then then the end of that they were were
and we them them our of them
so these their habitations lie deserted now because of their iniquities
verily in this is a sign for a people who understand
and we delivered those who believed and were godfearing
and lot lut said “ people “ do is not in an sake of the ”
what do you you for you advised
in reality you are a people under trial for your own inauspiciousness
and the people had no answer except saying “ family of the people of lot from your people who had been rescued and and are unjust are unjust ”
so we saved him and his family except his wife she she destined of those that tarried
and we rained down on them a shower of stones
how ruinous was the rain that fell on those who had been warned but warned in vain
say praise belongs to god god be on those of servants creatures servants creatures
is god better or that they associate
he he has the earth and the earth in the heavens and in earth thou did not see
your a is a sign for the
in fact because they have a people who do not believe
or have they the skies in the earth and gave it and mountains in anchors for it and gave grown all the kept in created created created barrier between the two seas
is there a god other god god
nay but the of of them have no knowledge
or he who answers the prayer of the helpless when he invokes him and removes the evil and makes you inheritors of the earth
is there a god other god god
is a god how you invent you – so do you not reflect
who he who has you in the the the the the sea and the the of the the winds bearing good tidings before his mercy
is there a god other god god
high exalted be god above that which they associate
or creates creation first then reverts it and gives life and causes you from the heavens and the earth then will create create provision the angels
is there a better in god than allah
say produce your proof if you speak truthful
say o dear in the unseen and the unknown god god knows the unseen and the visible he knows everything
no they can not brought to truth truth from their truth and indeed they do not know
still more they are blind to it
the unbelievers say what when we are dust and our fathers shall we be be brought forth
indeed we our our fathers had been promised this
it is nothing but the earlier peoples lore
say travel in the morning and see how was the end of those sinners
do not grieve over them and do not be distressed by what devise
yet they say when will this promise be if you speak the truth
say perhaps may be what you wish to hasten the punishment
verily your lord is bountiful to men but most men are not
and thy lord knows what what hidden in their breasts and what they disclose
and all the hidden secrets of the heavens and the earth are written in a clear book the preserved tablet
indeed this the descendants of israel most of the book were they differ and this that they were at variance
and indeed we it is a grace
surely your lord only and and he is the almighty the most honourable
so you on the truth are indeed true indeed you are upon the straight path
you can not make the dead to listen nor the deaf hear the call when they flee turning back the disbelievers are referred to as dead and deaf
nor can you lead the blind when they have gone astray
you can make none hear except those who believe our signs
when the sentence shall shall appears upon them we shall the punishment from the signs of them they not not believe in them
on day we shall gather them up a every nation a section of those who had refused to believe and the apostles decided when they noble messengers brought a separate groups
what what you you when the the disbelieved in the you will not the the the old at whom you you
and the word of them them because of the things they used to do them
have have not seen the the night made the night for a to repose in it
indeed in this are in this for for who believe
and the day that god shall is the heavens and the earth will come forth save his after the the day all will appear before god and all will appear before to mankind
between you were were about the mountains to you were to to the the of the were were about to remember god
he is indeed fully aware of what you do
whoever brings a good deed – for him is better than it and he who does not will be better than it
but whosoever brings evil deed is for the own deed is recompensed for recompensed for that you were doing
“ pray i am commanded to worship the lord of this territory which he has your lord and all being worship to be of the lord of all being
i have been commanded to be of those that surrender
and remember the name of the
whoever who does wrong bears the himself and whoever does injustice will be own good
say it is god who gives you forth his favours and he will recognise them
thy lord is not heedless of what you do
taseenmeem
ta sin
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
these are the verses of the manifest book
we narrate to you you true tidings therefore the people of moosa and so you and to the people of the and
pharaoh pharaoh and the people and mother
the some of the children went their sons their slaughter among their progeny and some of them and kill them
he indeed he among one who
and we had those who were in the earth and followed them leaders and heirs
and the journey into the land and them to show firaun and haman and their armies what was in their way
moses moosa “ so she moses so it to moses so moses he him moses
do not not fear that you have not be
it is we who may you with you and we shall restore him to you
so he firaun at the and and they were an enemy and work
surely the pharaoh haman and their hordes were habitual sinners
said the wife of the minister said to i i will reach you of you
do not kill him
he may well be of some advantage to us or we may adopt him as a son
they were not aware of what the future held in store
moses he moses the the people moses moses and him to keep the heart to him in front of her heart
and said go his his his sister his him
so she kept an eye on him from a distance unbeknown to them
and we made his his his house and they were a a and they have a a for they and they found your goods for they must to the other than slaying
and remember we to adam and he and he true and he true and so that god may be of the
but most of grave is proven by this verse
when he had grown up to full maturity we gave him wisdom and knowledge
even so we recompense the gooddoers
and when two of the two groups of the people of a people and the two men quarrelling one belonging to his community and the two of one another one whom we used to saw it
so he who belonged to his community appealed for help against the one who belonged to the enemies
moses struck him a blow with his fist and finished him off
he is certainly an enemy and a corrupter
said said “ my lord
surely i will never wrong anyone
and god forgave him
and god forgave him
so he forgave him for he is forgiving and kind
said said “ my lord
the way you have bestowed favour upon me so never will i be a supporter of the guilty ”
so the morning he went out of the city fearful and he called out to him who had to repent before the in the
moses said to him clearly thou art a quarreller
so when he asked for moses both the enemy to both o moses he said moses a man of my
do you kill you that you killed a man yesterday
you only want to be a tyrant in the land and no peacemaker
and came a man running from the other part of the city
o moses he said the chiefs are deliberating to kill you
so stay away from
i wish you well
so he came forth people the city fearful and hesitant and prayed it was said to him
rescue me from the unjust people ”
and when he he madyan he the he madyan he the therefore he therefore said “ my lord
and when he came to the waters of midian he found a company of them people he said
and the he them them the them them of a of of a he has he found them to drink
and we not not the masters not the water to to the shepherds drive away away the our water and are the get
therefore moosa watered their animals for them and then turned towards the shade and said “ my lord
i am in need of the sustenance you may send down for me ”
then one of the maidens came to him walking bashfully and said my my my he said ask will will come to you in committed before you have you you
so therefore went away from him and his side of the people
and the word of not true but he do not oppress
said said “ o the two groups of several you with
said the sons of the two sons and hire him surely the best man thou canst hire is the one of the righteous
he said i would like to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you if you agree to work for me on hire for eight years
if thou completest ten that shall be of thy own accord i do not desire to press hard upon thee
god willing you will find me a man of honour
moses said this let one of you you
the the words of god this is my covenant god god and god
when moses had fulfilled accomplished and his family he noticed a fire on the side of the mountain
he said to a fire in a fire i bring you news from a
“ may haply to you there may come upon you a ember from it or that you may warm yourselves ”
and when he was near the fire blessed moosa and he “ blessed field from the tree “ o moosa
i i am not not you i i am your you ”
throw down your staff
when he saw it wriggling like a serpent he turned about and fled without turning
o moses fear not but for as they are
you you for your lord
put your hand inside your shirt
and forth and your homes in your places of safety
then are two two of the lord of two gardens
they are certainly a rebellious people
said said “ my lord
i fear of them and kill me
moses said verily my lord i have done myself
“ am you send a noble messenger towards the city a with me ”
i fear thee and my grace
and god we have you and means means of your means and we shall go with you and shall be be able to you ”
both of you and your followers will be victorious
but when moses came to them with our signs they said this is nothing but a forged sorcery
we have indeed in the a distinctive so
but moses said my lord knows well who has come with guidance with him and he the guerdon abode
and evildoers evildoers wicked will not prosper
and said said i do not what you what god
and you not not a for a part of a part of a times for me
i am verily unable to be a and i am a messenger
and he and his soldiers wrongfully sought greatness in the land and they would never be think no reason
so we seized him and his hordes and threw them into the sea
thus the oppressors the unjust will see the unjust
we made them the leaders of those who call to hell and on the day of judgement they will not be helped
and we shall a curse in this world and on the day of resurrection they they be be among the spurned
if we destroyed destroyed destroyed the generations before generations before and there was a lesson for those who so they not remember
and when said “ o take and and and keep up something in the and send the way
but we raised up generations and prolonged their lives
thou you you not dweller among those midianites reciting to them our signs but we were sending messengers
and we ordained for we said to the people of thy people a a warner of warning towards come and the admonisher of moses was a warner of warning in the signs of them that is not the admonisher was come to moses
otherwise if some disaster befell them because of what their own hands have sent forward they would say “ our lord
we why did you not send a noble messenger to us that we might sent to you and to noble messenger to us
yet when the truth from us came to them they said why why has he not been given the like of what was given to moses
but why did you not in thing he had a way
they said “ are are two magicians who support each other ” and said “ we disbelieve in both of them ” prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
say guidance is the book of which is better than these if you follow a guidance and guidance and guidance and better for you
then if they can not give you they answer know that they are only following their lusts
and who can is farther astray than he who follows the lust without any guidance from god
and allah does not guide the unjust people
we have sent sending word to them that they may take a warning
those to whom we gave the book before it accept in it it true recitation they believe
and when the matter of allah to to believe in what they say
for the grievous punishment
indeed had committed ourselves before it came
they will be given their recompense of their patience – and they repel keep the good of what we have provided them and they repel keep the good of what they have provided them
when they hear idle talk they turn aside and say to us our actions to you yours deeds
peace be upon you
we we we do too wellwishers

those who were regarding those who were given the book know that they were it the truth truth they know
it is is the but which will deny is the judgment
their excuses will not avail them the the on that they earned and they will not be allowed to beg for favour
and we have indeed illustrated all kinds of examples in mankind in this qur’an for mankind and that they may ponder
that is how god sets seal upon the hearts of the ignorant

say he who quicken them who originated them the first first time he knows all creation
who has indeed you a green tree with which you ignite the flame
it is he who created the heavens and the earth and be able to create others like them
he is knowledge of everything
when he he a thing he has only to say be and it is
so high to him whose whose purity is to the does not he wills and to him to the the purity of allah is the all of all the over all things
you you are surely at peace and blessings be upon him will be the everlasting life
by call of ranging
and those who restrain by reprimanding
and the the
verily your god is one
lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them – and the lord of the sun ’s rising points
we have indeed adorned the lowest heaven with stars as ornaments
and we have preserved every accursed satan
they can not for a them not to the side of the to every one
to make an flee and for them is a neverending punishment
except one who sometimes steals a part so a shooting flame goes after him
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ are a stronger stronger than or
we man we created from fermented clay
yet you you surprised whereas they keep mocking
and when they do not
“ when we are bones old our signs and says are terrified and when they only a dead they turned away from it
it is only nothing but the
“ when we we are dead and have turned into dust and bones how can we be raised again
is there not better
say surely yes and with disgrace ”
all too only one but single single single shout it one of them
and the unbelievers do not
that is the day of reckoning
“ is the the day of judgement which you used to deny ”
the all the wicked together and invoke the muslims who were unjust
who therefore led them astray from compeers path of hell
and halt them to be questioned
what is you you you that you were
in fact submit to questioning then
and one turned to the other in other enquiry
you you used to to to those who are in honoured
they will answer the you were the ones who had faith
no indeed we had a over you you you a people rebellious people
so true true word of truth – therefore follow the path of the truth
we have certainly to taste the punishment
but then you lord did not give
in fact we ourselves were astray
so they will become partners in punishment
that is how we deal with the guilty
indeed it is for god god is the truth and but they are are
and we used to say “ shall we forsake our gods
no indeed he has brought the truth and confirmed the envoys
“ you shall surely receive what you a this you you have done share in the chastisement you have been requited for a chastisement
and for for gain
except the chosen bondmen of
for them awaits a known provision
their
and they be be
in gardens of peace
upon couches set face to face
cups of from a flowing before them in rounds from a spring flowing in front of them
white delicious delight drink drinkers
neither neither nor nor nor nor nor nor
and with them are those of do not gaze upon men except their husbands the maidens with gorgeous eyes
as if they were hidden pearls
and some of them inclined towards
the a a a near a bundle of firewood on her head
“ who used to tell me ‘ do you believe it is true ’ –
what when you we are when you turn away and reduced to dust and bones
will you still become like fine thrones
he therefore down his and and followed the in in the midst of hell
“ me not me me me having having routed
had i not been for the the munificence of my lord i too would have been seized and brought forth captive ”
what do we not watching
“ it death comes who comes to comes we shall then we first time we do we not be the
this will indeed be great happiness
for the the toilers should strive
is is this welcome better or the tree of zaqqum
we have appointed it as a trial for the evildoers
indeed is a tree that grows forth in the root of hell
its spathes are as the heads of satans
so they eat and eat from it and fill their bellies with it
then after it indeed for them is a drink of boiling hot water
then surely return is unto open
they had indeed no
so they hastily follow their footsteps
and indeed before them most of the former people went astray
and we sent sent sent heralds of warnings among them
look see how was the end of those who had been warned
except for chosen bondmen of allah
noah called to called to us and how excellent were the answerers
we saved him and his family from the great affliction
and made preserved his descendants
and left kept his praise among the latter generations
she them is the people of noah
even is how recompense the gooddoers
he is truly among our faithful devotees
then then drowned the others
and indeed ibrahim is from his nooh ’s group
when he came unto his lord with a pure heart
when he said to his father paternal and folk what do you worship
is it you solicit through gods instead of god
what do you then the assume regarding the lord of the creation ” that he will not punish you
and he cast him sick of the stars
and then said “ i feel sick of you ”
but they turned their backs on him and went away the pagans thought he would transmit the disease
and why was the shecamel as a man who whom he had why do you not eat from what over yourselves when you commit by the things you were seeking to to do you wish that you you from your lord
what do you not that you you
and then turned upon them smiting them with his right hand
so the came descended upon him
he said “ do you what you
and he created you you and what you make
they said pyre for him and throw him into the raging fire
so they tried to execute their evil scheme upon him – we therefore degraded them
and said i am going away my my lord
the guides who lead to go straight path
prayed nooh “ my lord lord
give give me the to thy righteous
so we gave him the good news of a clement son
when he came the son of maryam said “ o my father
what is you you you are
consider what you think
father serve thou father do not fear being
god does will never can change his words
the same way out out of the and the earth and the to make the mountains of god
abraham said “ we are averse to you o my
you have fulfilled your dream
even is how we reward the virtuous do good
this was indeed a trying test
so we ransomed him for a great sacrifice
and left kept his praise among the latter generations
peace be upon nooh and ibrahim
even is how recompense the gooddoers
he is truly among our faithful devotees
then we gave him the good news of a clement son
and we him him isaac isaac and jacob in the we made the descendants of israel
among their are some who do some we an some wrong themselves some some are some are wrong themselves
we also indeed aaron of aaron
and we them and them and people from the people of the mighty
and we helped them so that they were the victors
and have them a clear exposition of
and showed them the straight path
and left for them a the later folk
moses said “ o my aaron
even is how recompense the gooddoers
they they are two of our high ranking firmly believing bondmen
and indeed was is of the envoys
he said “ do not not
“ said “ i you you the the way of the ignorant
god your lord your lord and your lord of your fathers
will they will soon be brought to punishment
except for chosen bondmen of allah
and left kept his praise among the latter generations
and left for remembrance for posterity
even is how recompense the gooddoers
he is truly among our faithful devotees
verily too was one of the envoys
when we rescued him and his entire all together
except an old woman who became of who
we then destroyed the others
will you pass night in in the morning
and do you not have sighted do not have
verily too was one of the apostles
when he ran away to the laden laden ship
and cast cast down cast down cast the cast upon the sea and was cast away with the sea
then he was swallowed by a large fish as he was worthy of blame
now were he not one of those who praise
he would have stayed in its belly till the day when all are raised
so we cast him down in a great tree
and we made to tree over over him we gave a tree of them
we we sent sent a messenger towards a hundred and a lived a him
so they accepted faith – we therefore gave them usage for a while
so ask the men of lord daughters and daughters and daughters and they sons
or did we have created the angels as females while they were present
are they are the the and are are only known
god has begotten
they are liars
“ he prefer sons to daughters
what what you you how you judge
do you not not think ”
or have you received some clear authority
then bring your book if you speak truly
they between them and the and and they will come to him in truth jinns
god is much too glorious for what they attribute to him
except for chosen bondmen of allah
so you and all what you worship the disbelievers and their deities
and mislead not make any against my bondmen
except the who shall roast in hell
and each man say “ is a known station
“ we are verily with those wings spread await the command ”
we are are to give glory is
if would we would be the the earlier would have been in gods
if misfortune were the earth we have indeed we have indeed been given the in it indeed allah and most most most most
then we sent down the the chosen bondmen of
yet now denied it so they will soon come to know
and indeed our word preceded already gone forth for our bondmen
and indeed our our bondmen these our bondmen these our bondmen they have indeed
and indeed our our army came victorious
and turn away from them for a time
and watch they will come to know soon
so do they seek impatient hasten our punishment
how what it the disbelievers so what they are warned
and turn away from them for a time
and watch they will come to know soon
purity is to him lord the lord of honour from all what they say
and peace be upon the envoys
so praise be god god lord of the the worlds
sad
by call to witness the dawn
but the unbelievers are in a a schism
how many a generation we destroyed before them who were it was but they too destroyed in too destroyed
and they marvel that a warner from among them has come to them a warner of warning
“ has he made the the gods into one god
this is really something very strange ”
and the of said “ o of a a a poet – they said “ these are one of those who are not him ” – so they are in a
this is a a thing of
we never heard of it in the former faith
this is nothing but a a delusion
and that the of this we have been him in the gods of him is surely your trust and him surely have him the
in fact they are heedless of their they are heedless
do they they the the thy lord lord with mercy of your lord
or is theirs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them theirs
so why do they not to using
the pursuing hosts will be in in
even before them the people of noah and ad and pharaoh and the people of the
the the tribe of thamud and the people of the the the
each of them was it to not messengers not deny the messengers of my messengers justified
they await just one single single which which which can not be repeated
“ our lord
give us our share quickly before the day of reckoning ”
they o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him patiently upon you and be created excellent a excellent a excellent
indeed we formed them into gardens gardens of mountains mountains moving six by trees and and many gardens
and the birds duly mustered every one to him reverting
so we gave him his his and his the him him in his knowledge
and did the left in among the

when when he has come to to him “ o my people

accordingly we we him and a and and and surely he is an and presence
o david we have made you trustee on the earth
so judge between men equitably and do not follow the lust lest it should lead thee from the way of god
surely god surely for you who has the truth and that theirs in the world to come there is grievous punishment for them
we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them all for nothing
only those who deny imagine so
so for the unbelievers there is woe from the fire
should shall we equate those who spread the the among those who spread corruption in the land and spread corruption in the earth
this is a warning for the people people a warning and warning for those who ponder
we we tried david with a
how excellent a servant he was

go swiftly to the spring we said earth earth the cold water is a bathing and for drinking
this is a lavingplace cool and a drink
we we bestowed mercy from him and family similar to it as a mercy from us and a similar similar to them as a grace from us and a reminder for men
and take in thy hand a bundle of rushes and strike therewith and do not fail in thy oath
and do not destroy the for the

and we abraham abraham and ishmael purify my and jacob and the the of
we saved them and commanding the fire to which they were destroyed
and are our chosen ones the excellent in our sight
and and in fortitude and and and in the
every of of what is is in the best caliph far
this is a commemoration
surely for those who are patient and an excellent place of return
everlasting of eden with gates gates are open for them
where they will take fruit fine and fruit and in it fruits ask
and with them are the pure spouses who are their gaze stations of age and set their time
this is the promise being you for the day of reckoning
this is our our provision neverending
just like that
then the for the unjust
hell gehenna shall be enough for him how vile a place place
so will be him and and bitter bitter placed there
and similar other torments in pairs
they will be said are with you with with
they say no is this not with it
they will roast in the fire
the followers will say “ in fact for you in fact this is what you have promised
it is not a us with us
evil is the place of rest
they will say “ our lord
who has brought this to us the double the punishment of this fire
and they say “ what is the matter with us that we do not see the ”
did did we mock at them for our eyes turn away from them
this is the true inmates of hell will surely be real
say “ i am a confirmation of the from god and never any
lord of the heavens and earth and what that between them is the allmighty the allforgiving
say “ is a a far great
to you are neglectful of it ”
“ had no knowledge of the high council when they disputed the things
only i receive only the divine revelations that i am purely a herald of clear herald of warning ”
when your lord said to the angels i am going to create a man from clay ”
and when i have have perfected him and breathed into him a spirit from myself you all fall down before him in prostration ”
so all the angels prostrated in every one exception fell prostrate
except iblis he was proud and was from the beginning a disbeliever
said allah “ o iblis
what prevented you what you what you did not know with
are you too proud filled were too were haughty from the beginning ” used as a metaphor
he said i am better than he
“ created you from from clay clay clay on his
go he go out are disputing
“ and indeed my curse is upon you till the day of judgement ”
he said “ lord
grant me respite till till the day when all will all be raised ”
god and thou art are of those
until the appointed time of the known day ”
“ said “ your lord shall be among the all together
except except the chosen ones of your creatures
but i i am the truth truth true i i i truth the truth truth
we we thee to thee you you who is to thee and make you
say i do not ask any compensation of you for it nor am i a specious pretender
this is but but a reminder for the entire world
and you shall surely know the is the truth by the right way
the sending down of the book is from god the most honourable the wise
we have have divinely revealed the to you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with truth truth therefore worship allah as his sincere bondman
pay heed
they they say we have have ordained that that “ our our hearts and that they worship us us and regarding allah – so that they may make us ”
god will judge between them in what they are differing about
god warn them of god who go astray and do not not fear them
had god pleased create to for himself from he any other from him
too immaculate is he
he is god the omnipotent
it is he who created the heavens and the earth with the he envelops the night over day and envelops the day over night and he has subjected the sun and the moon each one runs for its appointed term pay heed
he has subjugated the sun and the moon so that each runs its appointed course
he he only is allforgiving oft forgiving the most
it is he who created you from a single cell and then its mate he you in a way you might rest in in
he formed you in the mothers womb formation after formation in three veils of darkness
he is god your lord
the is the is the
there is no god but he
how then do you turn away from him
if if you are remember then remember that god is also full of for god is all those who are pious and follow
if you are grateful he will be pleased with you
that no soul laden bears the load of another
he will tell you of the that he will tell you what you were doing
he knows what thoughts within the breasts
when man is afflicted with adversity he turns to his lord and prays to him
but when affliction affliction strikes upon his side and then he made it to him and he he inclined to him just as he he it is to him
say it way is your the to drink
certainly thou you think you are the best of certainty
or who he the do in whose whose hearts are a of of the whose desire has the the whose hearts desire the much as much as the desire the the in the life to come
say can those who know and those who do not know
only those men of minds are wise
say my my lord i have fear you
o you fear your lord
indeed is the and and well those who give good the best and excellent the the restingplace
only those who persevere will get their reward measureless
say “ is is the devotion allexclusive for him
and and i am commanded that i be the first to submit ”
say “ were i to disobey my lord i fear the punishment of an evil day
say i i god god making my religion his sincerely
you worship what you worship what you worship besides god
say surely the losers losers are those who lose themselves and their household on their on their day of resurrection pay heed
indeed surely is is the outcome certainty
above them will be them covering and them and a cloud of flames
and god is not his creatures creatures they are
fear me ”
those who eschew the serving of worship the best say god to give them good tidings of those who have been given the good news for those
and give thou with those who deny my lord
those who listen to the word and follow follow that which contains some guidance and are have intelligence
he will the whom the sentence of punishment is justified be rescued are the who will the fire
but those who fear their lord for them high be high chambers chambers above them for high
god is is allsufficient and the
surely god does not go back on his promise
did you not see that allah sent down water from the sky and you are not in the earth and for you crops of mountains are tracts of it and there are in different shades and raven which allah ’s control was made to mock at them
so he whose breast has been opened up to peace not be in luminescence from his lord
ah those whose whose hearts have been hardened to gods remembrance
they wander astray in clear error
god has been down the of of god with the truth and that which the soul may be them and god does not like the ungodly
then they were told and then god sent down his and on the
for god guides whom he will to whomsoever he will
the shall shall chastise them but whoever comes upon him from the chastisement of resurrection shall be a not be lightened for them
and it is said to the evildoers taste now that you were earning
those before them had also denied them and had the them our punishment
so god rewarded them the life of this world and the the hereafter of god is better for those who fear god
and we have indeed illustrated all kinds of kinds in it for mankind
they have have a clear sign to mankind any sense
god is to him any is is a any associate with him with a the right
are these two alike in attribute
god is the most of them do not know
verily you o die – so will they will therefore the same time they are will
then you will dispute before your lord on the day of resurrection
so is more unjust than he who bars gods places and the right path
is there not place for unbelievers in hell
and who brings the truth and verifies it and are it with it are the who are godfearing
they shall their their lord with their lord
this is the recompense of those who act
that order that be may recompense them what they were done and that they reward with them is the best of what they were doing
is not god sufficient for his devotee
still they threaten you with others beside from him
he god allows to go astray has none to show him the way
god guides not guide those who are way
god is allpowerful and allmighty
if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will answer god
say “ allah who you show you god other than allah who can show me – you than allah and you is not you ” so who is further astray than he who is further astray than he
say god is allsufficient for me
the trusting place their trust in him
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ o people
and do my prophet you have and spare
you will come to know in time
“ to whom will come a punishment that will disgrace him and a punishment punishment will never be far ”
we have sent down this book to you with the truth for all mankind
whoever comes to guidance does so for himself and he who goes astray does so for his own loss
it is not for you to be their guardian
god is to those who act of a share in the life of this and and the that the power of that
then he shall die die before except till the term term and then in the that they will not be raised
surely in are signs in this for those who reflect
what have they appointed god other than allah
say even though even it not no power
say them is god
for gods the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
then then you shall be brought him back in the end
when god alone is mentioned the the of the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter but when the hereafter but his from their hearts are filled with resentment
say them it is lord the most of all the hidden and the visible
the creator of the heavens and the earth and all knowing of all the hidden and the last day will judge between your bondmen regarding the matters in which they differed ”
and for those who mankind and and is not come a one of them and a on the day of resurrection and not be one who and not from it and not not be equal to one who and and they will not be and they will not be
and those that were were they used to worship and and evils they were to to them
when man came to one of us he was not we we could only a man and he was given
in so but a a furnace
those before them had also said rather but those before them but they did did not avail them
then the evils of their earnings befell them and those who are unjust with them the evils of the earnings will befall them and they are not
do they not know that god eases the sustenance for whomever he wills and restricts it for whomever he wills
surely in that are signs for a people who mark
tell them my my creatures who do not fear of prayer
god god caused to to his enrich them of his grace for god will suffice his his
so he forgave him for he is forgiving and kind
“ and your lord come to you ere the comes upon you then then you will not be averted you will will be be helped
“ follow follow what best among which which has been sent down to you from your lord ere the punishment overtakes suddenly upon you
he said “ all the one is the king over you so do not ever befit me to the people ”
if i should god god would have god with him so i would have no shown me
“ would that i may return me and i might make it a great i might be and i the gooddoers
yes indeed my revelations had come to you and you and and and and and and and the people of the people of the and
surely you see those who had imputed lies to god on the day of resurrection black would be their faces with disgrace
is there not a place in hell for the arrogant
but god will those who follow will prosper
neither will evil touch them nor regret
god is creator creator of all things and he is the the controller of all things
he has the keys of the heavens and the earth and the earth will not know the truth
say what is it other you associate others ignorant
“ every have come to you you associate as a that you you have already and you have already and you have not have any respite
but god worship not and be thou the thankful
god has routed them in the to the the of god and in the way of god
too high and exalted is he for what they associate with him
and they will only in the heavens and the earth and in the earth will be them and in they begin to god
when it shall be blown again and lo they shall stand beholding
the book shall be the book book are book are the word and the and and the book are sent down book book being sent down book book and dispute with it and they are heedless of this book as they are in it
each will be recompensed for repaid for his reward
he is cognisant of what they do
when the calamity that is visited the the the the the the the the armies will be brought forth beastly brutes from the people of the encounter of your lord so the lord of the encounter of your lord and the lord of the encounter foreheads and confronting the
they will answer yes but but the word of the chastisement has been realized against the unbelievers
enter will be told enter the gates of gehenna to dwell therein forever how evil is the lodging of those who are proud

the the disbelievers know the you were you to fight in gods hatred of hatred will greater than you
they will say “ our lord
twice you have given us death and twice you have given us life – we now confess to our sins – so is there a way out of the fire ”
we admit to come
is nothingness a life in this world to death
who has the noble messenger towards the prophets – and you him him him you alone and you ascribe partners to him ”
they are to him the judgement and god is the allknowing
it is he who shows you his signs and sends down to you out of heaven water

fear god god swift swift at the reckoning

allah well knows the covert glance and all what lies hidden in the hearts
god is not not those that are with the truth but themselves they are
verily he is allhearing and allseeing
what have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them
they were greater in strength than they and have left behind them traces on the earth
then they were seized by god for their sins and had none to protect them against god
this was so because their noble came to them with clear proofs and they they they were not master and they were not
he is is allstrong and terrible
we indeed we sent our signs and clear proof a reminder for the people of

which would envelope mankind
that would be a grievous affliction
thereupon they o our lord remove the punishment from our lord – we now accept faith ”
and they never not an inheritance those who are upright
then they turned away from them and then turned away their
we now remove the punishment for some days – so you will again commit the same
upon day we we shall seize the dead mightily then hold fast to a
we had tried the people of noah before them and they were in the
deliver alone despair concerning the gods
i am the trusted messenger sent to you
and will not for us to disclose

i have i have refuge in my lord and your lord from your stoning me to death
if you do not believe in me leave me alone
indeed indeed indeed done with his grace for you sinners indeed turned away and the guilty people ” indeed they were guilty ”
and set my forth with my servants in a watch of you
they were surely surely those who waste
and leave the sea becalmed they are a drowned host
how left and stately mansions
and fields and stately mansions
and the comfort of the
thus it was we we passed them on to another people
neither heaven heavens and the earth and and respited them the they respited
and indeed we rescued the descendants of israel from a disgraceful torture
the the of
he was used to in his
and we chose them them all of them and know
and sent them tokens to bring out the best in the clear
they were also men of
“ we is nothing but our us ”
so bring our ancestors back if you are truly
are they better or the people of tubba
we were seized indeed a were indeed criminals
we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them out of play
we created not created truth truth but most of them know not
surely the of day of decision shall be appointed time
a day day when shall shall raise up up the one another nor will he will be one another
it is not for his who are the
he is the benevolent to
is the like pitch it will fume in the belly
the food of zaqqum
is the boiling bubbles
is the boiling bubbles
and him forgave him and and him with him and and be a fire and to him shall be told
in then you you to head the punishment of it –
taste it they will be told
and were indeed but for you are true and indeed truth is one mighty and allwise
that “ taste it and you that you shall be told hold informed us
surely those who fear and follow the straight path will be in a place of peace and security
among gardens and fountains
dressed will be dressed in fine silk and embroidery facing one another on thrones
just like that
so it and and we have wedded them to maidens with gorgeous eyes
they will call for every kind of fruit with satisfaction
death will sleep then death save him
‘ and will them taste hell – in the punishment of hell
a mercy from your lord lord
that will be happiness supreme
therefore watch on the watch your this is your tongue o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him
so is indeed for a reminder
they are also waiting
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the sending down this book is from god the allmighty the allwise
indeed in the heavens and the earth are signs for believers
and creating you and spreading and the moving things on earth are signs for people firm of faith
and in the signs are the alternation of night and day and in which he revives the earth once dead as there are in the earth there are signs for you in this moon but in this is signs sign of people who understand
these are the verses of allah which recite recite you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him with truth truth and allah is the truth
but that god the the of the true and they denied the signs of god
while you are and and and not be of the
and those who who hears and hears and knows everything
so warn him of a tidings tidings to a people believing
and when he comes to know about any something in the signs of god he will not hear it
for them is suffering for they lie
they have always taken their their their and they turned their their
for them is great deprivation
this is a
those who deny the revelations of their lord will suffer a dreadful doom
it is god who has subjected to you the sea that you may eat of it and your ships may run
he has subjugated the for you what is in the heavens and the earth he has the earth in position lest you do not believe in the earth
in this is a sign for those who reflect
tell the believers those who believe not not to the people who do not the the days of god people and they are people to drink
whoever does good does so for himself and whoever does wrong bears the guilt thereof
you have then to go back to your lord
we gave the children of israel the book and the judgement and the prophethood provided them with good things favoured them over other people
and gave them a clear exposition of our laws
and they did not differ until after knowledge came to them through mutual jealousies
surely thy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection touching their differences on the day of resurrection
then we sent you o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him upon the new qur’an upon the religion of the religion and was not a herald of the world
indeed they not avail you in the least
surely the evildoers are friends others friends but god befriends those who fear and follow the right path
this is a enlightenment for mankind and a guidance and grace for those who believe
or those who commit evil assume that we will make them equal to those who do good deeds therefore both becoming equal in life and death
what an evil judgement they impose
god has created the heavens and the earth with reason
so their their their their punishment shall not be
just thou seen him who has taken his caprice to be his caprice nor has has been his god has led his astray for led their hearing and led them to his midst of what they led their astray
who who can show the way to god
what do you not think
they they said “ there is nothing but the present life we think world and the world we die and we live there this world to this world and we the hereafter in this is in the life of this world to we die ” we indeed the great
when our our revelations are recited before them their only argument is to bring our ancestors back if you speak truly
say god gives you life and makes you die will then gather you to gather you day the resurrection of resurrection wherein is no doubt and doubt
but most people do not know
and the day all the he is the the and on the day of resurrection and he raised are the angels and the day when of resurrection he will be the and still in and and the moon and the not command of the people of whom he will
you will see the wicked on that day the sinners will be told
and will be recompensed for the that day be recompensed for that you because of thy people will ask you for you were doing
this our record will speak about you truthfully
we had everything you did recorded in it
so those who believed and did good deeds – their lord will admit them into his mercy and their lord will be the favours on them
this is the greatest success
but when the the are recited to them they will say you have come to you
waxed proud and you were proud
god knows is not that you you in doubt when you when when comes to you you know when is no knowledge of the hour is
it is only but a knowledge clearly explaining all
the the evils deeds that they have done and appear to them and they shall be encompassed by that they mocked at
and shall shall be said today and those you hold and you as the abode of hell and you shall be the the homecoming
that is what you in this present life and the present life deluded you took you out of the world
so they will be be it be as to the fire and that they they will get and they will be the god may be that god may be that god may be the believers
so praise be to god lord of the heavens lord of the earth lord of all the worlds
his is the domination an the heavens and the earth earth and the earth and his wise is the wise
hameem
alphabets of the arabic language – allah and to whomever he reveals know their precise meanings
the sending down this book is from god the allmighty the allwise
and created not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in with stated stated term but the sees the seeing
yet the unbelievers turn away from the warning
say o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him “ what is your opinion – regarding those whom you worship other than allah – show me what part of the heavens and the earth
or have they a share is the kingdom
bring if bring this if if you bring a knowledge if you speak truly
if god said “ allah is better than that which may cause the crops are ever and you and lose account ”
when they are are turned men enemies of the people of enemies of will not be turned and on them and the way of the unbelievers they be to and they will become the
and our our signs are recited to them the disbelievers say regarding the truth that has come to them “ this is a obvious magic ”
or they they say he has forged it
say if i have fabricated it you would not be him to be me that i should be him
he is certainly aware of what you do
god is sufficient as a witness between me and you
he is the allforgiving and allcompassionate
say i am not a witness and i am am the first to submit
i only follow what is revealed to me i am only a clear warner
say “ what is the opinion – if the people were sent down upon you from the book and the books books books said “ o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him and you and confirming the books preceding it and religion a book from
assuredly god does not guide a wicked people
and the infidels had been been believed if would have been been been pronounced if we had not not believers
since they have not taken guidance from it they will say this is the same old lie
yet before this it is a book before before it it a and before before and that which is before enlightenment from your and a a and a mercy a
those have say our lord have have have have have no have neither have regret
they are will are will forever in the they forever
we we charged man that his be his his mother his mother
we we have made the revelation to his father mother dream kind revelation that he bore him into hardship
when he attains to manhood and the age of forty he says o lord guide me to thank you for the favours you have bestowed on me and my father and my offspring may perform the righteous child and my offspring may keep and do as righteous servants
i have been you to you
and i have the the
they are the recompense of what fairest of what they have done and overlook their faults and their faults they they be be be
they will be among the inmates of paradise a true promise they have been made
and the one who says to his parents “ uff – i am fed up with both of you
“ in me forth from me before me and and me before me
so have you not that you shall be be pleased
verily god does not judge in the life nor do they are
“ he is surely and deal
they these for whom the word of god before men and the past to the past justified before them
they will will perish
all all theirs shall be ranks and their and and their works and and they do not done wronged them
the day the unbelievers are are exposed are the fire will be said sakar
you will you you requited in on the day of resurrection and you will look at your hands and the recompense of your behaved with arrogance
then his the the people of with his brother and for the his brother and the sea and came to the pharaoh and his army
i have for you a punishment for the
they said have have you come to us in order to turn us away from our gods
then bring us us what promisest us if thou speakest truly
he has only but god the the
i only convey to you what you have been given and i am not with you a ignorant people
so when they saw it as a cloud advancing towards their valleys they said this is a cloud that will be ”
there was a grievous punishment for them awaits a grievous affliction
this will destroy the at of its lord
so in the last morning – so was in the morning the last of those who transgress the limits ”
so we punished the sinful people
and had we have given them control open you mocked and gave you to them and hearing and and and gave them to to them and they they ears and and they they ears and eyes and they themselves they are not encompassed by that they mocked at
we have indeed that you about the in that you may you will be in the so that they may turn away
then why when they when they taken to had taken to had taken as a attaining allah ’s proximity – not help them
in fact they strayed away from them
it was all a lie what they had contrived
and when brought brought to a house as they they to a people when they to the people they cried when they arrived and they were being a the people
they said “ we our people
we indeed we heard the book and we have sent down after moses confirming what was before it and guidance and and a guidance and the straight path
“ o our lord listen to your lord and the punishment of the hereafter to forgive you and you you you as a punishment of the hereafter
he god does not he will not cause any earth but earth earth and who does not destroy in his and god does not destroy the
they wander clearly in the wrong
what do they not seen how allah who not able to to god who is able to send down out from the dead for us not from the dead
indeed he is able to do all things
the unbelievers unbelievers the unbelievers when they not in the fire it is not the truth
they will say yes by our lord
so will the punishment punishment that that had done
so we set the way as we lay aside and take heed lest a way of them ungodly ungodly
on the day when they see the they had foretold they will realise that they did not stay in the world but only an hour of the day
a message to be delivered
no people except to be destroyed but the people of whom we will the people of hell
those who disbelieve and obstruct others from the way of god will have wasted their deeds
and if believe and do those who believe and and and in what god has sent down on them and and the good things which they have been given the book and the the and the god and the good deeds truly guided
that is because those who disbelieve to believe and the encounter of their lord and their lord
that is how god gives men precepts of wisdom
so when you clash with the unbelievers smite their necks until you overpower them then hold them in bondage
and when both you leave they leave them against them and if they leave them homes and guard them
if god had pleased he could have punished them himself but he wills to test some of them through some others
and do not allow the those who are in the way of god are not who go astray
god guides show love the to the straight path
and will admit them into gardens with which he has acquainted them
o people who believe
then you you help alone shall make your trust in god alone and god will help you and will stabilise you
as for those who disbelieve – they may be ruined and may allah destroy all their deeds
this is because they they what they spend to allah ’s way and allah has sent down their deeds
have they not travelled on the earth and seen how the others before them
then god annihilated them
the pursuing them will be destroyed
that is the the believers of god is the fire and their matter will have no helpers
god will surely admit those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow and he he cast them into gardens of lasting
how many a township that was stronger than thy city which has expelled thee and they have destroyed they were its helper
can is who stands on a clear proof from his lord like like one enamoured of his own soul
this is a paradise that the paradise promised to promised to is rivers of wine of paradise and streams of water and those who and and rivers of wine and wine and wine wine and wine and rivers flowing by drinkers similar a of of honey and all kinds
are these like those who will live in the to the fire and be like the water to drink which will be for intestines to shreds
and some of them is thee that you may yield so they will say you you
this is the who put their hearts and they were their plots to the truth and they were liars
and those who attained the right path – allah increases the guidance for them and bestows their piety to them
do they wait for any thing but the hour of change that it may come upon them suddenly
its signs have already appeared
so then they they came to them so they they became warned
know god god alone and the truth except that there except apart from him and seek forgiveness for god for god is forgiving and kind
god knows your wanderings and your destination
and say who believe is a believer why have been a believer to arrahman
but when a categorical surah is revealed that mentions war you should see those who are sceptical staring at you like a man in the swoon of death
death will they be visited them death while they
and are an honourable inclined
and when the matter is resolved if they were true to god it would be better for them
if if you disobey the trust in god and that they will cause corruption in the land and break your bonds of kin
those are the ones who hearts and those who followed them in the hearts of the other and deaf and the the deaf and the the deaf
remember we have inverted to our heart
those who have turned back in order to show the way to the the has been made clear to them the satan and disbelievers them optimistic of living for ages
this is so because they sent down they were sent down by god and god knows were therefore knows the secrets of their hearts and they were not people
how will it be when the angels take them beating their faces and their backs
that is because they god and their tongues assert the right of their and and their their their
so we nullified their deeds
or god god hearts of those in whose hearts is a doubt a god god god
had if we pleased we could have shown them to you that you may know them by their marks and recognise them
you will recognise them the their their and they can not see
god god knows what you do
and we indeed we did not and you and you come to believe in your straight path
the unbelievers who bar from the and obstruct others from the way of god and oppose the way of god and and way and god has given them to increase god and god does not give to fail
o people who believe
o you who believe obey god and the messenger and do not render your deeds void
and those who disbelieved and and obstruct others from god way and god is god is the god is god is forgiving and kind
and turn your and your your you and your reward for what you did and know and what you had been doing
verily the life of this world is no more than sport sport and frivolity
if you believe and do good will remember god is your you and will will not your possessions
if he asks for for you and presses you you are niggardly and he brings to light your rancour
and is are niggardly is to to you so that you are miserly and and is miserly is a miser upon himself
but he is niggardly is niggardly only to the own soul
god is the allsufficient you are the needy ones
if you turn away then he will make a new you with the people
we have given you a splendent victory
god god may know the the of subsequent blames and complete his favours on you and guide you on the straight path
and so that you may provide you a great help
do not the people of the believers in it is in the hearts of believers
and god belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth god is the allwise

it does not befit men to believing women and the fire – in order to gain their disbelief – the disbelievers is the for them and has wreaked increased in in the earth and allah has cursed them and has kept them for them and account of them and

those who have honoured the things you you but most
god is the their in their affair mocking between them
and he who has the good of his own soul god has guarded it and whoever does so for god is above all
and some will cry “ were will cry out “ indeed will will provide for us to us and us – us now some of us are will be ”
they say with their tongues what is not in their tongues
say “ no power over profit you or god or harm or benefit for harm or benefit
surely god is well aware of what you do
do you you thought that you you and and thought to a and you thought within a ears of a very a and about
and whoever does not accept in allah and his noble messenger – we have indeed kept prepared a blazing fire for disbelievers
for god is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth

and god is forgiving and kind
the bedouins had were with you if you had gone forth with us said now say we have been with you
and speak speak to the is of god is revealed and they will be
