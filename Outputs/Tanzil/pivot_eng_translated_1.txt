but god surrounds them from all surrounds all things
and is is is nemesis of
preserved on the guarded tablet
i oath to witness the and and the night star nightly arriver
and what you you what sijjin is

so do you infidels with submit and disbelievers
so then they had them to with earned
glorify the name of your lord most high
who created and proportions and then then proportioned and
who determines one directs
the one out when pasture
and reduces them to upon the sky a
we shall make you you desire the tidings and us will be forget
unless god wished to perfect his if he but to you will dead
he he knows visible and knows aware what very
we shall may find you slowly towards you

who one burn in the fire
then which he neither neither die nor nor any nor
indeed surely will will will be ever
except recites the name of his lord and serves offered devotion
so no you prefer the life of the of
though the life to come is better and abiding
this was of earlier the earlier books
and he ibrahim disavowed and and and
we showed given to to you o you
many faces will will contrite on that day
and they are of the requital
there in be of inmates of hell
given water from the boiling spring to drink
they will have no grievous for them in none
neither neither he nor left hand
on that day which will that that day separated will categories
and they are of the requital
in high empyrean
but hearing idle talk

and thamud thamud thamud carved rocks in rocks in
the the of of of of
full of thamud who carved rocks in the valley
and multiplied corruption
so your lord poured a hard and punishment of them
for he is certainly in the lord
so whenever man whenever you on warning a lord then says him says “ says says says says says says says my me
but he he tries him by restraining his means he he pleased to despises me
no
in do you to the

he punishes whatsoever he will have mercy on whom he please
but god is and and kind
give you who believe do not be in your your own and your own own who who who who
if the of of what is not not in goodness
keep away from the fire prepared for the infidels

and hasten towards of pardon of the lord for for the paradise extending the the and and and for for for for who who who for for
they who in in joy and and and happiness and who gave words apprehend who and
god is good good who to do good good good
and for they not been but of whilst of sin and some sense think they so think they they they do not sense sense
surely god is severe for requital
they they not not perverse about their doings knowingly
he recompense is pardon by by lord and and with streams of running water where they will abide for ever
how fair fair the recompense of who did
many things the you has been you
travel over earth earth of what land and the the accused the apostles of
this is a a declaration for mankind and a an a a warning those who preserve themselves
and do not be worship to do
“ he you may you are if those are
if you time that a which now of you a a a a among you from a
we has sent surely you jews and like the the of god who mankind mankind mankind like and the like like like like like like like like like like like like and like does like does like does like does like like boastful
and is so be believers purify to those who are differing and their truth to god god
do you not not yet a you or you yet not known you you known
and will you to to what to believe in this
that she therefore him it by a back to
nothing some of the is the the
so they apostles had had had it was you
so you become long out work along or are or and in turn to you will not not own
but if one do turns after will will it transgressor
but god will reward those who give thanks and are grateful
god does not burden the soul beyond capacity
and a a have is a a place of time
he who to more desires a hereafter we shall shall give him to him who desires a desires a a who world to who who

god god will you this this for the life best god and
god god is provision god who righteous
o believers if you listen to the infidels the will will make you you your backs and you you turn turn your backs backs then so order go you you
certainly god lord your god and he he surely
we we strike terror for the hearts of unbelievers for ascribing compeers for god for which he has sent down down which he god has sent no down of
hell is their residence the abode destination of the unjust
only it you like a go or in god growth for you bring you by god god god all all your
it you god you as good for god favours doing prophet but the the among among others among you another to you you you having to to you having having
he he will you it flight before us in order to try you

and will will guide the hardship
remember as you as rushing and hill look at the land battle look against the from the from from from from from from the was from you you you were you fight you you you you you you and you and you and and fight you fret for opportunity
god is aware aware of what you do

o you who believe do not like like those who unbelievers disbelievers say disbelievers to to the land like to to to not not like like like us we like like like we and not not not of not not been been of
so does not find god may to them hearts
the the the the one of the need of everything
and god aware all all you you do
if you are are in the and god then then then will be the of for god better better god that you
and indeed god god to god

thus the same way attractive have been to the unjust
even had not learn the the and their to before before clear proofs had they clear proofs to them
so is how we requite the who
then then we you you towards you you why
and our clear messages are recited to them those who do hope hope expect to meet say say one one one one one to to

then then they will then except worship will
so where do you turn away
thus the word of your lord about those who disobey concerning true lord is they will be not
say it is there among those first then and then then then him originates then reverts it reverts
say it is god alone one first creates and then reverts it
how how can you turn how
ask them is there among those you associate ascribe god god can can the can show the the the
say it is god who shows the way to truth
is it more more one who whole the who is is better the better who who who who act better right not in better
that is what judgement that you
many of them other nothing but illusion yet illusion can not replace the reality
god knows what what they do
this is not the for of for except except god but far
it confirms what has done with peace and
all be to the lord lord the the worlds
do they say of the prophet that he has composed it
say then bring bring other chapter like this and call anyone can help can help you you you say you say truthful say you
in fact they deny hour in beyond the hour of its
so had the people of denied
so we the wicked end of the wicked
there men lost of believe in it it will come to him in
your lord lord the the of and benevolence
if they they you you you and so had not to me have have you yours me me you
you are surely answerable for what you for what you do
some of them the some of prophet know and make the the the of of but you in in
some of them is one of you you not not you the the blind even blind and they they they say they they they they you
surely god does not wrong eyes
and them were not them them a them day day the day that for them not on the day day of of day of
and surely who will not in the meeting with their
but those make they did not guidance
every we we to to them the the the the the of of of them gather them gather all gather gather them them reckoning
but god said to the for them
for have a for for and over
yet all sentence is given passed with justice and one who is done and come come wronged wronged
surely promise those promise promise promise this promise affair you will be the
say god dear god a none to you have no other nor nor nor any
every time a a certain term
when their they is neither there will not a a nor
say “ the thought of your your if he is doom doom would to to to the the
do you will make hasten the the of
if you then you makes then to him the the again and after it to the
so will the the punishment they taste the had denied
to them is things of life life this world world to theirs
yet they ask you to is if to believe
and by the of surely lord the truth
you can not invalidate it
even if once all to earth sinned possessed whatever is on the earth would be be be to it
and those of least and needy
yet the sentence would still not be to all
to recites that promise god is true true the is the supreme
he is the giver of life
he is no benevolent
o men you warning to has to your your lord a remedy for the doubts of doubts doubts of and and
say gods is the the of the and in this idolaters
say to is warner warner been a and messenger
or ask have been god his own own is imputing to to god god
but listener lies lies god in of the lies
but they can wish to goodness this various for them them most people men men men men
what is known him or or or hunger or the the
not have not the the the in the heavens and or earth or and or the the the the the which there not to less less
god has for not those who regret fear the evil
those who who and and pay and and not their their their
for them is good news in the life of the world and in the life to come to to
god is begotten of god
and that be greatest great great
so should not grieved by by what they say
he is the protector and knows
remember that only is the the heavens and the earth to god god god the
so they holy prophet who prophet is they follow god follow him who are who are are are god god god
they had not nothing of any nothing but themselves
that is he who made the night for you to rest and day that day that day haply
indeed in in signs in this for those who
they say god has begotten a son a son
too immaculate is he
whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth earth belongs to him by whatever all belongs to him
that advise this have but
did not not know that god sees all things
say he who is god about the truth will succeed
approach give of the the slandered of a people of this after after shall shall shall them them after land we
when when when returned gods the the the account said said to said o my god and the and the the and the and and and and the and the deities and and and pride pride pride with
they he shall be up incumbent returned
yet in the ‘ relatives and come to me me me to me and and to to me me
if you have me me me after me then deliver me i how leave me the you me me me me me me me me me
yet many other they will the
so we saved him and those those him the him and in and and in the ark and the the the the who who who
and some we denied the signs and signs signs and and sea
look then the fate of those who who were warned
afterwards we sent many the to to to their
still they were to to what the who who what been denied
that is how we seal hearts the hearts hearts hearts the ignorant hearts
then we sent aaron our and and aaron with people your people people on people full that
but they denied and a remained sin
thus when the truth had come to them from us they said surely this is nothing clear
said say this what you speak the moses manner regarding has come to you has come to come
how man is the will was and himself
so that our and to to us back our our us we found our fathers our
we shall shall to you in you you
and the cleverest magicians to to doom you pharaoh
so when the magicians arrived moosa said to them cast cast spell you have to cast
when when they had to moses said for what they are magic are our our
he him put him the a him place the place drink
when they said to the the truth of the sinners
thus did the people of pharaoh people that the that they the the them them them them and them and and and and and and a the
indeed he is the the
moses said o your people and if you are what you place place your people not kill you are kill
they will say “ our lord our lord

when we the armies against the family
but the pharaoh and of and of pharaoh and the magicians and firaun they
said the disbelievers people people of them other other witness other other other with them other said said said you i and and not said said said i
yet they were you would never believe at to to

when when our word our we rescued hud hud by our grace and those who believed with him and grace and saved them a a a a dreadful doom
these were the people of ad signs lord the signs of of book and the of against apostles apostles apostles and their their and and the bidding of every of
so they curse accursed them and world and they of the damned of the day of resurrection resurrection
so the they they turned the lord of lord lord lord of their lord
so ad turned to their ad
be the thamud thamud the lord of their lord

such the lord the habitations when your lord the punishment seizes his people their the people
the say is is surely is the
it is indeed one a of doubt
for we prepared a day for a place

wherefore we him him and family his family
and and my
and left his his for posterity
when noah are nooh nooh been all
that is how we reward the virtuous
he who among among is faithful high
then we destroyed the others
and left also abraham the his
when he came to his
when people people asked to to and people people people worship
god and not witness to god whatsoever
what can you the the lord of the worlds the
then he turned to rest
he said i am sick of what you worshipped
so indeed they they disavowed
so their brother with their towards you said do you not eat yourselves your offerings
what is wrong with you that that speak that speak
so a striking striking with which
and one of dwellers of on
why do you you these you carve yourselves he asked
“ neither had come you and him you

he who among among is faithful high
and the was indeed indeed the apostles
wherefore we saved him and his family
but they woman who backs on an brothers behind she a stayed behind
then we destroyed the others
you pass by their you in in
or at night then how that then do do not understand
to jonah the the the the apostles

who have seen though their had and schismatics who had
and thamud thamud the thamud

in fact they they certain
do they possess the treasures of your

or do a proof of our generations have have or some of some who who free free
has god daughters and the sons and sons sons to
or do you prevail of many any that fear they

or do they planning a conspiracy against
verily the will is of of ultimate
have do other have any other god besides god
he is too exalted for what they associate him
and they should see a segment falling from the heavens they they will say is a a massive cloud

how fact man is a a of himself
and be excuses
i not forestall the you judgement so that
so we chose reveal it it whole it
so as we recite it follow it reading
the exposition to its meaning details rests on us
none you you but you do not

he admits whosoever he will to his benevolence
but for the evildoers he has prepared a painful punishment
i call to witness that who are sent consecutively
and those that strike violently

when the oceans surge are swept away
when the graves are laid
and the little girl buried alive is asked

indeed the of of your lord is most
the is second creation created come from the
he is surely near
the lord the the glorious throne
he he whatsoever he pleases

the the disbelievers disbelievers are
but god surrounds them from all surrounds all things
and is is is nemesis of
preserved on the guarded tablet
i oath to witness the and and the night star nightly arriver
and what you you what sijjin is
it was the star that shines with a piercing everything

i call to witness the heavens sky the sky

glorify the name of your lord most high
who created and proportions and then then proportioned and
who determines one directs
the one out when pasture
and reduces them to upon the sky a
we shall make you you desire the tidings and us will be forget
unless god wished to perfect his if he but to you will dead
he he knows visible and knows aware what very
we shall may find you slowly towards you
then you you the the
surely is the way of god
the the wretch of
who one burn in the fire
then which he neither neither die nor nor any nor
indeed surely will will will be ever
except recites the name of his lord and serves offered devotion
so no you prefer the life of the of
though the life to come is better and abiding
this was of earlier the earlier books
and he ibrahim disavowed and and and
we showed given to to you o you
many faces will will contrite on that day
and they are of the requital
there in be of inmates of hell
given water from the boiling spring to drink
they will have no grievous for them in none
neither neither he nor left hand
on that day which will that that day separated will categories
and they are of the requital
in high empyrean
but hearing idle talk
there is a stream of running water in it
and within it high couches placed on high
goblets keeps
cushions arranged
from those to of from

so how how little how how how a
and the ark spread in

you are not a warden over you
other than him who turns his
and will know know they has punished the by with with greater severest punishment

and thamud thamud thamud carved rocks in rocks in
the the of of of of
full of thamud who carved rocks in the valley
and multiplied corruption
so your lord poured a hard and punishment of them
for he is certainly in the lord
so whenever man whenever you on warning a lord then says him says “ says says says says says says says my me
but he he tries him by restraining his means he he pleased to despises me
in fact means deny yourselves be
nor urged you urge one any poor
and you devour others inheritance greedily
and love wealth with all your heart
and the when is the able to powder grounded pounded to dust
and when the when of angels and of
on day day it remembers all that he of good remember that that good what he will that be be

that does not show the iniquitous
crude and above all and and infamous
