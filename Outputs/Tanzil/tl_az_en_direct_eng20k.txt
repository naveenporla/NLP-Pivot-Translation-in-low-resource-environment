we we we created you from a male and female and made you races and tribes that you may know one another
verily the noblest of you in the sight of allah is the most godfearing of you
lo is the knower the aware
the bedouins say we believe
say ‘ you do not say rather we submit you say ‘ we have not entered into your hearts
if if begin obey allah and his messenger he will not diminish any of your works
god is forgiving and merciful
the believers are only those who believe in allah and his messenger and then in in allah and his messenger and strive in their cause with their wealth and their lives in the cause of allah
such are they who are the truthful
say o you are in allah religion about your your god is aware of everything and he is the of all things
they regard it as a favour to thee that they have embraced islam
say ‘ do not favour your embracing as a favour
nay but allah has a favour unto favour unto his hath he hath guided you to you inasmuch as ye ye enjoineth on you if ye are earnest
lo allah is the knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth
allah sees the things you do
qaf
by the glorious koran
nay they they marvel that a warner from the the of the the the the the the unbelievers say this is a strange strange
shell we are dead and have become dust shall we be raised to life
that is a farfetched return ”
we know that which the earth taketh them and with us is a recording book
in they denied the truth when it came to them so now they are in a state of
have they not looked at the heaven above them how we have built it and adorned it and there are no rifts in it
and the earth we we have it it and cast on it firm mountains and we have caused to grow therein it
a lesson and an admonition for every penitent worshiper
and we send down from the sky water water and therewith we caused gardens to grow and grain of the grain of harvests that you reaped
and the soaring palm trees with clustered dates
as a provision for the and we we revived a dead land
even so will be the forth from the dead
the people of noah denied before them
and the aad and the awn and the brethren of lut
and the dwellers of the wood of the people of tubba each one denied the apostles so my threat took effect
were we then worn out by the first creation
no they are in doubt about a new creation
we we we have created man and we know what his soul whispereth to him and we are nearer to him than his jugular vein
when the two angels who receive all one on right and on the left
he uttereth no word but there is a vigilant observer ready
and the hardship of death comes to what is what is what you used to
and the trumpet is blown
this is the threatened of the day of the
and every soul shall come accompanied by a driver and a witness
it will be said to the the punishment of this now removed from removed from you your veil and sharp your sight is ever
and his companion said here is this is what i have present with me
it will be said “ both of hell angels cast every stubborn disbeliever
every <unk> of good transgressor <unk>
who fabricated another god another god along with allah then cast him into the severe punishment ”
his companion will say “ our lord i did not make him rebel but he was far gone astray
he will say “ do not in in my presence had already proffered you you the threat
the word is not changed changed and i do not inflict with my servants
on the day when we shall say to hell “ are you full more full ”
and paradise will be brought near to the pious not far away
it is that you were promised promised is heedful one oftreturning
who fears the allbeneficent in secret and comes with a penitent heart
enter it in peace
this is the day of eternity
therein they will have whatever they desire and with us there is more
and how many a generation we did we destroy before them in they stronger than they in strength and in traversed have been traversed
verily therein is a reminder reminder for him who has a heart or giveth ear
and we created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days and no fatigue touched us
so be thou that they say and celebrate the praise of thy lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting
and in the nighttime hallow his praise and after the prescribed prostration
and listen on the day when the caller will call from a near place
the day when they hear the cry in the truth
that is the day of rising from the dead
it is we who give life and give death and to us is the destination
upon the day when the earth will split asunder from them they hasten hasten for them for that is the mustering easy for us
we are fully aware of what they say and you are not a dictator over them
so admonish by the qur an him who feareth my threat
by the scattering winds that scatter
and those that bear the burden of the rain
and those that glide with ease the sea
and execute the of of apportioning rainfall
surely that which you are promised is true
and lo the judgment is surely to befall
by the sky full of woven
you differ in truth
and those who are away from it is turned away
doomed be the conjecturers
who are heedless in a cover
they ask when is the day of requital
it will be the day when they will be tormented at the fire
and told taste taste your ordeal
this is what you were trying to hasten
lo the godfearing shall be in gardens and water
taking that which their lord has vouchsafe unto hem
verily they have before the muhsinun of the deeds
they used to sleep but little during the night
and at the they would pray for pardon
and in their wealth there was a share for the beggar and the deprived
and in the earth are signs for those who sure faith
and also in your ownselves
do you not see
and in the heaven is your provision and that which you are promised
by by the lord of the heavens and the earth it is as that truth speak
has the story of abraham s honoured guests reached you
when they entered upon him and said peace be to you ”
then he hurried to his house and brought a fatted fatted fatted
and laid it before before them and said will you not eat
then he felt a fear of them
they said “ do not be afraid of the good news of a birth
then his wife came forward with moan and smote her face and said a barren old woman
they said “ your lord replied he is the the wise
he said “ what is your business o envoys
they said we have been sent to a guilty people
that we may upon them stones of baked
marked by your lord for the transgressors
so we brought forth such believers as in it
but we found not find there one household of those that
and we left it a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
and in moses too there we sent him with a clear proof
but he turned away and his court saying this is either a sorcerer or a madman ”
so we seized him and his hosts and flung them into the sea and he was reprobate
and in ad when we loosed against them a a barren wind
that left nothing it came upon but rendered it decayed bones
and in the tribe of thamud when it is told to them enjoy yourselves for a while
then they disobeyed the command of their lord so the bolt laid hold of them while they looked on
they were not able to stand nor were they helped
and the people of noah before them they were a people people
and heaven built built built it it
and we earth the earth as well how how we we we lay plain
and created everything things in pairs so that you may reflect
flee flee to allah
i am a a warner from him
do not set up another god with god
i am am a clear warner warning from him
even so a messenger came to those before them but they said a sorcerer or a madman
have they arrived they a common understanding
in fact they are rebellious people
so turn away from them thou wilt not be reproached
and remind for admonition for benefits the believers
i have not created the jinns and men only to worship me
i seek not provision from from them nor do i desire that that i should feed me
surely allah is the provider the provider owner of power
and verily for those who do wrong wrong there is a portion of the fellows of their fellows of the fellows of theirs so that they come to them the unbelievers
woe woe to those who disbelieve in that day of theirs which they are promised
by the mount
and the book inscribed
on a parchment unrolled
by the house house
and the roof uplifted
and the surging sea
the punishment of your lord is coming to pass
there is none that can ward off
on the day when the heaven sways in agitation
and the mountains move move with an awful motion
woe on that day to those who deny
those who are in speculation
the day when they are thrust with a disdainful thrust into the fire of hell
“ this is the fire which you used to deny
is this magic or do you not see
endure it heat thereof heat thereof heat thereof ye will weary thereof whether ye are patient
you are only being requited for what you used to do
lo those who kept their duty dwell in gardens and delight
rejoicing because of their lord has given them and their lord will have saved them from the punishment of hell
eat and drink with relish for that you used to do
reclining on couches ranged in rows and we we we we d them to houris
and those who believe and whose progeny follow them in faith we shall join their offspring and we will not diminish them them of their their their
every person is hostage to what he has earned
and we shall supply them with fruit and meat such as they desire
they they will pass from goblet to one another
and there go round them youths youths as they were hidden pearls
and they will advance one another inquiring
saying will say we we aforetime we we our houses worried
but allah has been gracious to us and has protected us from the punishment of the burning wind
we we used to pray to him
he he is the allbenign the allmerciful ’
therefore exhort you o prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him enlighten for you from your lord neither a soothsayer nor a madman
or say they is a poet for whom we expect a adverse turn of fortune
say “ go on waiting i am waiting with you
do their minds prompt them to this or are they say this
or say they he hath fabricated it
rather they have not believe
then let them produce a discourse like it if they are truthful
have they not been nothing or are they
did they create the heavens and the earth
no their belief is not certain
or are they treasures of your lord in their keeping
or are they the tyrants
or have they a stairway whereon they overhear
then let their listener bring some clear authority
or he daughters and daughters and you sons
or askest thou a hire from them so they they are weighed debt
is is the unseen they have access to the truths in the realm
or do they intend a plot against you o muhammad saw
but those who disbelieve in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism in their oneness of allah islamic monotheism
or have they have a god other than god
glorified is allah above having any partners that they ascribe to him
and if they were to see a piece of the sky falling down they would say ‘ clouds
so leave them until they face their day of they will be stunned
the day when their guile will not relieve them anything for their nor will they be helped
and surely the evildoers there is a punishment besides that but most of the most of them do not know
and be thou patient under the judgment of before you lord thou art before our eyes
and exalt the the praise of your lord when you arise
and proclaim his purity during the night and at the receding of the stars
by the star when it goes
your companion is not astray nor errs he
nor does he speak out of desire
it is naught but an inspiration that is inspired
which one of the powers hath taught him
the strong of stood stood
while he was on the highest horizon
then he drew near and came down
he was was two bows length off or nearer
then he revealed to his servant what he revealed
the heart did not lie what he saw
will you you going to contend with him regarding what he sees
and he saw him another time
by the lote tree tree of the ending
close to which is the garden of abode
when that covered the lotetree which covered covered
the sight did not waver nor did exceeded it
indeed he saw of the of the greatest signs of his lord
have you considered considered allat and al uzza
and manat the third one the pagan arabs
what have you males males and he females
that indeed is a division most unfair
they are but names which you have coined you your fathers fathers merely follow your fancy which allah has sent down no authority they follow their conjectures and they carnal desires which pleaseth them but them is no guidance
or shall man have what he fancies
to allah allah belongeth the after life and the former
and many an angel is in the heavens whose intercession avails not except after that after allah gives permission to whomever he wills and approves
those who do not believe in the hereafter name the angels with the names of females
they have not but of conjectures and they follow nothing but conjectures and conjecture is no substitute for the truth
so withdraw thou from him who turneth away from our remembrance and seeketh the life of the life
that is their attainment
your lord knows best who who strayed from his path and he who strayeth from his way and he letteth himself is the
and to allah belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth earth and those who do evil that they have done and recompense those who do good with allah in the best of rewards
those who avoid major sins and indecencies — except for minor lapses
surely your lord is abounding in his forgiveness
he is you of the you since you produced you from the earth and since you were foetuses in the bellies of your mothers
so do not assert person who is who is
have you considered him who turns his back
and gave a little then refrained
does he possess knowledge of the unseen and he sees foresee
or was he not informed of what is in the scrolls of moses
and of abraham who fulfilled his summons
that no burdened soul shall bear another s burden ’
and that man shall have only what he strives for
and that his effort will be seen
then he shall be recompensed for it with fullest fullest fullest recompense
and that to your lord is the returning
and that it is he who who makes to laugh and makes to weep
and that it is he who makes to die and that makes to live
and that it is he who created the two kinds the the male and the female
from a drop of seminal fluid when when emitted
and that second creation is incumbent on him
and that it is he who gives wealth and wealth
and that is is the lord of sirius
and that it he who destroyed the ad
and thamood and he spared not
and the people of noah before that they were more unjust and more rebellious
and he toppled the cities of sodom
so there were covered covered with whatever they did cover ie
so which of your lord s bounties will you deny
this is a warner of the warners of old
the imminent is imminent
none except allah can avert it
do you then wonder at this discourse
and you laugh at it
and you are behaving proudly
so prostrate to allah and worship him
the hour is drawing near and the moon is split
and if they see a sign they turn away and say “ continuous magic ’
they belied the lie to their own desires
and every matter of to the deeds of deeds will be to to him
and there came to them news containing a deterrent
effective wisdom farreaching warnings warnings warnings
so turn away from them
on the day when the caller calls to a terrible thing
with looks downcast they come from the tombs as if they were locusts scattered abroad
scrambling toward the caller the disbelievers will say “ this is a day day
the people of noah denied before them and they belied our servant and he said a crazy a a he rebuffed
then he prayed to his lord ‘ i am vanquished so help me ”
then opened the gates of heaven with water pouring down
and we made the earth burst forth with springs and the waters met for a preordained purpose
and we bare him on a thing of planks and nails
sailing in front of our sight as a reward for him who had been
and verily we left it as a token but so that remembereth
so how were my punishment and my warnings
and have we made the qur an easy understand understand
and tribe of aad aad belied the dreadful was my my my my my warnings
we unleashed upon them a screaming wind on a day of unrelenting misery
plucking men men as though they were uprooted stems of datepalms
so how were my punishment and my warnings
and have we made the qur an easy understand understand
the tribe of thamud denied the warnings
saying said “ shall we follow a one from among us
then then we should be in error and madness
was the message been given to him out of us
nay he is an an liar
they told ‘ tomorrow said tomorrow is is liar liar
we we sending the shecamel as a trial for them so watch them and have patience
and inform them that the water is be shared between them each each them them turn
but they called their companion and he took a sword and killed
so how were my punishment and my warnings
we sent against them a single cry and they became like the dry of a penbuilder
and have we made the qur an easy understand understand
the people of lot rejected the warnings
we unleashed upon them a a stones except stones family of them except the family of lut we rescued them
as a favour from us
thus we reward the who giveth thanks
he had warned them of our onslaught but they dismissed the warnings
they they tried his persuade him and we obliterated their eyes then said taste my punishment and my commination
in the morning early came upon them in the morning
so taste my punishment and my warnings
and have we made the qur an easy understand understand
the warnings came to the people of pharaoh
they belied our signs all of them so we seized them with the seizure of the allmighty honourable the
are your disbelievers better than those have been better than you or exemption in the
or do they say we are a host of
the hosts will be routed and will turn their backs flee
nay but the hour of their tryst and their hour is be disastrous and bitter
surely the sinners are in error and madness
on day they will be dragged into their faces into the fire it will be said to them taste the touch of hell
we we have everything in measure measure
and our commandment is but one word of the twinkling of an eye
we have destroyed the likes of you is there any that will remember
everything everything they have done is in the books
and everything big and great has been written down
verily the pious shall be in gardens and rivers
in a good seat centre in the presence of the king the most
the merciful
has the qur an
he created man
and taught him taught him
the sun and the moon to a reckoning
and stars and the trees prostrate themselves
and the sky he raised high up and he has set up
so that may not transgress the balance
and observe correct measure weigh with justice and do not cheat the balance
and the earth he he lain out for the beings
in are fruit and palmtrees sheathed
and grain in corn with and fragrant herbs
which which of your lord s marvels ’ will you both jinns and men deny
he created man of clay clay like the potter s
and created created the from of a smokeless fire
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
lord of the two easts and lord of the two wests
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
he has let the two seas that meet together
there is a barrier between them they encroach not one another
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
there come forth from pearl and coral
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
his are the ships ships run raised up the sea like landmarks
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
all that it on ephemeral
and everlasting is the entity of your lord full of majesty and beneficence
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny

which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
we shall shall to you o o you two classes
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
if company of jinn and men if you can penetrate through the confines of heaven and pass through them
but you will not pass through except with an authority
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
there will be unleashed against you both smokeless fire and molten brass you you will not be helped
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
when the the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red red hide
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
on that day no will be questioned asked his sin nor will they ask about the sin
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
the guilty will be recognized by their marks and will be seized by their forelocks and feet feet
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
this is hell hell which the guilty
they shall go round between it and boiling water water
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
but for him who feared the standing before his lord are two gardens
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
with abounding branches
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
in them two gardens flow
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
in both of them will be kind of every fruit
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
reclining on couches lined with brocade and the fruits of the two near of the nigh
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
in maidens of maidens restraining their glances untouched by any man or jinn
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
lovely as rubies beautiful and coral
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny

which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
and beside them are two other gardens

dark green with foliage
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
in them both are two springs gushing springs
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
in them both will be fruits and datepalms and pomegranates
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny

which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
reclining on green cushions and rich carpets
which is it of the favours of your lord that ye deny
blessed be the name of your lord full of majesty and splendor
when the imminent hour befalls
there is bound to know
bringing will be <unk> upside down
when the earth is tremble at the terrible
and the mountains crumbled
so that they become scattered
you you become divided into three categories
the people of the right hand — and those of the right hand
and those on the left hand how miserable shall be the fellows on the left hand
and the outstrippers the outstrippers
those are they who nigh to their lord
in the gardens of delight
a large group from the earlier generations
and a few from later ages
they will be <unk> with gold woven with gold
reclining thereon face facing each
immortal youths going round to them
carrying bowls and pitchers and cups filled filled
causing them neither intoxication it nor intoxication
and such fruits that they they choose
and flesh of fowls that they desire
and there are be wideeyed maidens
like unto pearls hidden
a recompense for what they used to do
therein they shall hear no vain talk nor any sin
but only the saying peace ‘ ’
and those on the right how – fortunate are those on the right hand
among thornless lotetrees
and <unk> plants
and spreading shade
gushing water
and fruit abounding
neither withheld nor forbidden
and upraised couches
perfectly we formed them a a a
and made them virgins
tender and
for those on the right hand
a large group from the earlier generations
and a multitude from the later generations
as for the companions of the left hand – and what will the people
in scorching wind and scalding water water
and the shadow of black smoke
neither cool nor refreshing
they were that they indulged in luxury
and used to persist in the awful sin
and they used to say when when we are dead and have dust and bones shall we be raised again
we and our forefathers
say o muhammad saw verily the those of the generations of old and the latter
will all gathered together to the appointed time of a known day
then you the erring ones who belied the truth
will eat of the tree of zaqqum
fill your bellies with it
and drink boiling water of scalding water
so you will drink like thirsty camels
that will be their entertainment on the day of recompense
we created you why why do you not believe
have you considered the sperm that you emit
is you you who create it or are we the creator
we have decreed death among you and we shall not be outstripped
that we may exchange you to you and you you you you you you you a fashion you do not know
and have known the first genesis then why do you not reflect
have you considered the soil you till
is it you who cultivate it or are we the sowers
if we will we would make it broken orts and you would remain in jesting
saying we are laden
nay we we are deprived
have you considered the water you drink
is it you who caused it down from the clouds or we we the sender
if we will we would make it bitter so why do you not give thanks
have you considered the fire which kindle
was it you who caused its tree to grow or are we the grower
we have made it a a reminder and a boon for the desertdwellers
so celebrate the name of your lord the allsupreme
no i swear by the positions of the stars
and verily is is a great evidence if you understand
that is indeed a recitation honourable
in a book hidden
which none can touch except the purified
it is a revelation from the lord of the worlds
is it this statement that you laze
and make it your provision share
why then when the soul leaps up to the throat of the dying
and you are are watching that
— we are nearer to him than you are but you do not see
why if you are not not to bondage us
can you bring it back you if you are truthful
then if he is of the near
there shall be comfort and fragrance and a garden of delight
and if he be of the people of the right hand
then upon you o peace on the right hand peace be on the the right
but if he is of the deniers the the mistaken
then a welcome of entertainment boiling water
and a roasting in hell
this is indeed certain truth
so glorify the name of your lord the allsupreme
all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god and he is allmighty and allwise
to him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
he gives life and causes death and he has power over all things
he is the first and the last and the and the inner and he has knowledge of all things
he is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established himself on the throne
he knows whatsoever plungeth goes into the earth and whatsoever cometh forth therefrom and whatsoever descendeth from the sky and whatsoever ascendeth unto him and it is he wheresoever ye be
allah sees the things you do
to him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
to allah all matters matters for decision
he makes the night into the day and plungeth the day into the night and he is the knower of that is in the breasts
believe in allah and his messenger and expend of that which he has made you successors
and of of you who believe and spend in allah s way
what aileth you that you believe not in allah when the apostle calls you to believe in your lord and he hath made you covenant with you if ye are believers
it is he who sends down manifest signs to his his that he may bring you out from darkness into light
and verily allah is to you full of kindness most merciful
why is it that you know that god has given the future of the heavens and the earth belongs to allah who who has power to the
those who spent the fought before you fought and fought not fought not the equal
they are higher in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards
but to each allah has promised the best reward
allah is aware of what you do
who is he who will lend allah a goodly loan to allah and he will double it for him and he will be a generous reward
on the day when you see see believing men and women their their their their their right and their right right hands their their their their them today for them and be glad tidings for the gardens flow flow for it it will be said today for ever
that is the supreme triumph
the the day when the hypocrites men and women women will say to those who believe wait for us that we may borrow your light
they will be told “ go back and seek light for yourselves elsewhere ”
then a wall shall be set between them wall a a a door and whereof it will be mercy and and mercy and and will be be
the the will the believers will say will we will not believe with you
but you led led you temptations about you doubted and doubted and the religion of allah s religion and the and deceived you you and the and the falsehood
and the chief deceiver satan deceived you deceived you deceived you deceived you
so today you ransom will be accepted from you nor nor you from the way of hell
the fire is your refuge
it is your companion — which an evil fate
is the the time come not the hearts hearts hearts hearts hearts of the book to the remembrance of allah and that the truth that has become like unto those who were vouchsafed the book and the and they become not and they become as though they were not
and many of them are transgressors
know that allah quickeneth the earth after its death
we have made made clear the signs for you that you understand
verily the men men and women are men women a a a and lend unto allah a goodly loan shall be multiplied for them and theirs shall be a generous reward
and those who believe in allah and his messengers and those who believe in the truth and their martyrs are the straight
they have their guerdon and their their light
but as for those who disbelieve and deny our signs they are the inmates of the hell
know that the the life of this world is mere diversion and play glamour and mutual vainglory and mutual vainglory and rivalry and wealth and children children
then in the is is the him him in the hereafter and him him him is forgiveness and him and him him forgiveness and him him forgiveness and his noble
as for the life of this world is nothing but a merchandise of vanity
so race lead lead towards your lord and towards the expanse of wide as vast as the heavens and the earth prepared for those who believe in allah and his apostles
this is the bounty of allah which he it to whom he will and allah is of bounty abounding
the affliction of the book in the earth or it but but it is in in the book before we initiate it we know is easy for allah
that you grieve for what you grieve over what you nor will and exult exult because what that has given you
allah does not love the proud
those who are stingy and encourage others to be niggardly
and whosoever turns away from god know that allah is selfsufficient worthy of praise
we we sent our with clear proofs and we sent down with them the book and the balance with the balance
we we sent down iron wherein is great violence and benefits for mankind and that allah may know who succoureth him and his messengers

we have sent down clear ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc

on the day when allah will raise them up all together he will inform them of what they did

have you not considered those who were forbidden to conspire together together together and they they conspire to what they had been forbidden and conspired secretly conspire together
and when they come to you they greet you with a greeting wherewith allah greeted not greeted with us and say why does not say say us us and why say thou not for us that allah has forbidden

and you are told to disperse disperse disperse disperse allah allah those who have been given knowledge and those who have knowledge and those who have knowledge and those who have knowledge
and allah is wellacquainted with what you do
believers when you come to the messenger with the messenger before the alms before to go back at home
that is better for you and purer
but if you find not afford to to the means of allah is forgiving merciful
are you afraid of offer alms before your conference
then if you do not do it and allah pardons you then establish prayer and pay the and obey allah and his messenger
allah is aware of what you do
have you not see those who befriend a people whom whom allah is wroth
they belong neither to you nor of you and they swear to falsehood and they know
allah has prepared for them a severe punishment
evil indeed is that which used to do
they have taken their oaths as a disguise and bar from from the way of allah so theirs shall be a torment punishment
their their wealth will not avail them against any of allah
they are the people of the fire and they shall remain in it forever
on the day when allah will resurrect them all together they will swear to him as they swear to you thinking that they are on something
indeed they are they who are the liars
satan has mastered hold them in them and caused them to forget the remembrance of allah
they are the party of the
lo it is the devil s party who are the losers
those those who oppose allah and his messenger will be among the lowest
allah has decreed i shall prevail i and my apostles
verily allah is strong strong the almighty
you will not find any people who believe in allah and the last day endearing those who oppose god and his messenger even though they were their parents or their or their brothers or their clan
for such he written faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from him
and he will admit them to gardens with streams running in them to remain in them forever
allah is pleased with them and they are they are pleased with them
lo allah s party of the who are the successful
all is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god and he is the allmighty the allwise
and is the who expelled from the people of the book that their homes of the book of the the of the book of god would not have broken against them and their their and and you would not have cast them into their cave and when you have
and had allah not prescribed decreed for them he would have punished them in this world and theirs the the hereafter is the punishment of hell
that is because they opposed allah and his messenger
and opposes god — — is severe in punishment
whatever palmtrees you cut cut down or left standing on it roots it was by allah s leave and leave the prophets of allah that he might humiliate the transgressors
and spoils from which allah gave his his messenger saw from his messenger saw you you urged not any horse horse whenever <unk> it but allah allah gives leave and allah gives over over over all things and allah is over all things
the booty of his has been taken from among the people of the messenger muhammad saw and the the orphans the needy and the the needy and the traveller that you may not be the the of the rich among you and rich among you
accept what the messenger gives you and refrain from what he forbids and and whatever he forbids you
surely is is severe in punishment
it is the poor who were the the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their homes and their possessions and seek seeking allah s bounty and his pleasure and his messenger
and those who had before their faith in almadinah and accepted faith in their love those who have not emigrated in them and and emigrated in their hearts of bani annadir and them their prefer bani annadir and and if they prefer bani annadir and they prefer them to

hast thou not observed the hypocrites hypocrites the brethren among the people of the book s brethren who disbelieve if if you are driven out of are expelled we shall not obey anyone against you and we shall not fight anyone against you
but allah bears witness that they are liars
if they are expelled they are expelled fought against them they will not help them them they would not help them
if if they them them they would turn their backs then they would not be helped
indeed they have more greater fear of you in their hearts than allah
that is because they are a people who do not understand
they will not fight against you together except in fortified townships or from behind walls
their adversity is great themselves
you think think they are united but their hearts are diverse
that is because they are a people who do not exercise their reason
like those who do tasted tasted the tasted of their their tasted the tasted the mischief of their actions and they is a painful punishment
the parable of them when when he shaitan satan when he telleth he says “ i am quit of you
i am quit of you
i fear allah the lord of the worlds
so the fate of them both will be in it they will abide in it forever
this is the recompense for the wrongdoers

you befriend them whereas you have spurned the polytheists and they have have your you you their own hurt and you from your lord and you have actually to them
send you to to them friendship in secrecy and i know what what you do and i know well that which ye do
and whosoever of you does so he indeed strayed strayed from the straight path
if they they you you they would be your enemies and stretch out their their hands and their tongues to you evil and wish to disbelieve you you you disbelieve
neither your bloodkindred nor your children will profit to you day of resurrection day of resurrection nor will will separate you
allah observes all that you do
you have a nation in abraham abraham abraham along with him and said “ when we have dissociate you you and we you you you you you you worship other than allah and we you and you you and you you and you you and you you and you
our lord do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve and forgive us our lord you are the allmighty the most merciful
assuredly there hath been a good example for for for those who have forward to allah and the last day
and whosoever turns away then verily allah is allsufficient rich the praised
it may well that allah establishes love love between you and those whom you have a enemies enemies
and allah is allah is allforgiving allcompassionate

but only only to those you who have fought you out of you from your homes and aided in your exile with you and expelled you from your homes and friends abetted in it
and takes friends befriend friends with them they are the wrongdoers
o believers when believing women come to you as emigrants test them
allah is aware of their faith
then if you know them to be believers to them not to them them them they are not back to the nor
but the unbelievers what they have spent
and is no sin in you you marry them you have given them their dowries
ask the the wives of the wives ask the for the what they have spent and let the return to the bridaldue that which have spent
this is the rule of allah he rules among you
god is allknowing and wise
if any of your wives desert you you to you you retaliate then to retaliate of those who have gone away the unbelievers have been given to you to what they have spent
and fear allah in whom you believe believers
o prophet when believing women come to you swearing fealty to you that they shall not associate anything with allah nor steal nor fornicate nor nor nor nor nor nor will they steal their children nor nor disobey you for their feet and and disobey you for them and
god is forgiving and merciful
o ye who believe befriend not a people against whom allah is wroth
surely they have despaired of the hereafter even as they despaired of the hereafter even as they are the graves in the graves
all is in the heavens and the earth magnifies god and he is the allmighty the allwise
o ye who believe wherefore do ye say do you not not
it is it with allah that you should say that which you do not
allah allah those those who fight in his cause in ranks as if they were a solid structure
and moses said to his people “ o my people why do you know me although i am to you messenger to allah to you you
so when they went out of allah
and does not not the evilliving folk
and when jesus son of mary said “ o children of israel i am allah s messenger to me confirming the torah confirming the torah before me and to the messenger and be the to me
but when he brought them the miracles with evidences this said this is sheer trickery ”
and who does greater wrong than he who invents a lie against allah when he is being invited to islam
and allah not not a wrongdoing people
they want to put out of their light against allah with their mouths but allah will perfect his light even though the disbelievers get annoyed
it is he who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the true religion that order that he may make it prevail over all religion however much idolaters
believers shall i direct you to a commerce that will deliver you from a painful chastisement
you shall believe in allah and his messenger and strive in the cause of allah and your your wealth
that is better for you if you know
he will forgive you your sins and will admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens gardens adn eden
that is the supreme achievement
and make you cherish help from allah and give you a victory and a near victory
be you o allah in allah s son son of mary said to them disciples who will be said to allah s cause ’ ‘ ‘ be be the s ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’
so a group of the children of israel believed while a group disbelieved
then we strengthened those who believed against their enemies and they prevailed over them
all that is in the heavens and the earth sings the praises of god the king the holy the almighty the the
it it is who sent the unlettered a a a messenger from themselves reciting them their them and purifying them and teaching them and the book and wisdom and though they were been guided
and among them is them them them them do not give them yet joined them but he is the allmighty allwise
that is the bounty of allah which he giveth unto whom he will and allah is the mighty the owner of
the parable of those who were charged with the torah then they torah is the it is a donkey carrying books
evil is the example of the people who denounce the signs of allah
and allah not not a people who are not the way
say o you who have judaised if ye have ye have come from allah s allah s and then wish for death if ye are truthful
but they will never wish for death because of what their deeds have committed
and allah is the knower of these evildoers
say death from which you flee will surely come to
you will be be returned to the who knows the unseen and the visible and he will inform you of what you used to do
o when the call is made to prayer to the day of friday day and friday and friday <unk> of remembrance of allah
that is better for you if you know
then when the prayer is ended disperse in the land and seek the bounty of allah and remember allah often and haply you may prosper
and when they see some merchandise or amusement they scatter you leave leave leave to say you say you is better standing or some amusement and say allah is allah is allah is allah is better than best for providers
when the hypocrites come to you they say we bear witness that you are indeed god s messenger ’
and god knows that you are his messenger and allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars
they have taken their oaths as a shield and they repel away from the way of god
evil is is what they have been working
that is because they believed believed then disbelieved and disbelieved and their hearts are sealed so they do not understand
when you see them their bodies impress you and when they speak you listen to their speech
they they they every they they they they they blocks of them they would be with them
they are the enemies beware them
how they are perverted
and when it is said to them come the messenger of allah messenger ask forgiveness for you they turn their heads and you see them turning away away
it is equal to them or ask forgiveness for them or do not ask them for god will not forgive them
allah allah not the evilliving folk
they are the ones who say “ do not spend on those who are with allah s messenger until they scatter away from the
and to allah belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
they say “ when we return to the city stronger than the the honourable bin <unk> bin <unk> bin <unk> bin who hyprocrites hyprocrites hyprocrites hyprocrites hyprocrites hyprocrites almadinah the meaner the chief of hyprocrites hyprocrites hyprocrites hyprocrites almadinah the meaner
but honour belongs all honour belongs to allah and his messenger and the believers believers but the hypocrites do not know
o let who believe let not your wealth or children divert you from the remembrance of allah
those who do so shall be the
spend of that wherewith we have provided you before death cometh unto one of you then he saith my lord why if thou wouldst reprieve me a little while i will be among the righteous
but allah will never defer a soul when its term comes
allah is aware of what you do

his is the sovereignty and to him belongs all praise praises and thanks he is able to do all things

he knows what is in the heavens and the earth and what is in in the and what you disclose
he is aware of what is in the breasts
has not not heard the you of those who disbelieved before you
they tasted the tasted of their evil and a painful punishment
that is because their apostles came to them with their with clear proofs but they said “ allah guides guide them and guides guides them the right
allah allah is rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
the unbelievers have vehemently contended that they will not be raised to life
say to them “ yes certainly i will certainly you you and be raised again fully informed of what you you have done
that is easy for god
so believe in god and his messenger and in the light which we have sent down
and is is aware of what you do
the day when he gathers you together on the day of gathering that will be of of mutual
and whosoever who believed and acted righteously shall be gardens gardens underneath which rivers flow therein to dwell therein to dwell for ever and he shall be of hell
that is the supreme achievement
and those who disbelieved and gave the lie to our signs — shall be the inmates of the fire and it forever and how miserable destination
no affliction occurs except by allah s ’ leave
whosoever believes in god he guides his heart
and allah is of everything
obey allah and obey the messenger but if you turn away then know that the messenger is only to convey the message
allah there is no god but he
in allah therefore let the believers put their trust
o you who believe faith are your and children of your children so beware of you and beware of them and if you pardon and overlook and forgive you and allah is allforgiving allmerciful
your wealth and children are but a trial and with with is a mighty wage
so fear allah as much as you can and listen and obey and spend in your way of your own good
and whosoever is saved from his own greed such are the winners
if you lend a good loan to allah he will multiply it for you and will forgive you
god is the allclement ready to appreciate good and reward and forbearing
he knows what is beyond the ken of perception and the visible the almighty the wise
o prophet when you divorce women divorce them at their waitingperiod and compute waiting period accurately and your lord
do not turn back from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit a gross indecency
these are the limits set by allah
and whosoever transgresses the set limits set by god then he has wronged himself
you knowest know maybe allah will bring something new situation
then when they have reached their term either retain them honorably or separate them honourably
and call for witness two just persons among among you and among yourselves and give witness to allah
by that is exhorted whoever believes in allah and the last day is exhorted to be godfearing
and whosoever fears allah he will make his duty to him
and he provide for him from where he does not count
and whosoever puts his trust in allah he will suffice him
indeed allah fulfills his purpose
god has has set a measure for everything
as for those of your women have despaired of menstruation menstruating if you have have doubt of their waiting period of three months and those who have not menstruated
as for those who are pregnant child their period period shall be the delivery of the child
and whosoever keepeth his duty to allah he maketh his affair
that is allah s ’ ’ which he has sent down to you and whoever fears god and keeps his him and his him he will absolve him of his misdeeds and will will give him a great reward
house the divorced women where you have them not harass them to make them straiten in straits and not them them straitened circumstances and they they pregnant maintain their circumstances and they will not be pregnant maintain their
and if they suckle give them give them their burden till they give them their due portion of their burden and then give them a payment
but if you make hardship for another child then then another woman suckle for him child for him
let the man spend according to his means and he whose means spend out of what he has given him spend out of what allah has given him
allah does not task any soul beyond what he has given him
god will bring about after hardship
how many a town population revolted against the command of its lord and we called it to a severe account and punished it with a dire punishment
so it tasted the evil outcome of their deeds and the outcome of their deeds was loss
allah hath prepared for them a grievous chastisement for them allah hath fear of them o o o the people of understanding
god has sent sent down to you a reminder
a messenger reciting to you the revelations of allah clear to you and to bring forth those who believe and do good works from from the darkness
and whosoever believeth in allah and worketh righteously he shall make him enter gardens underneath which rivers flow therein to shall live for ever
allah has has given him an excellent provision
it is he who created created seven heavens and of the earth like like thereof
the command descends through them so you may know that allah may know that allah has power over all things and all things
o prophet why forbiddest you forbid that which allah has made lawful to thee seeking to please your wives
and is is forgiving merciful
allah has has sanctioned the dissolution of your oaths
allah is your protector the allknowing
and the prophet confided a matter to to his wives his of his made disclosed him and he disclosed it known to him he disclosed to him he part of it and part of it and part of it and part of it and he told of it
then when he informed her it she said “ this he informed the allinformed ”
if you two men to to to your your your your your your your hearts then to your hearts and allah is hearts and if you are to the the then the believers and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
it may be that if he divorces you his lord will give him in exchange wives better than you submissive to obedient penitent obedient penitent respectful obedient penitent devout
believers guard yourselves and and families from a fire whose fuel is a fire and stones which which which angels bear and disobey the angels and and do not the commands of allah which they commands them and they are commanded
o you who believe

o prophet struggle with the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be harshly with them shall be hell with them and hell an an evil destination
god allah those those example of those who disbelieve the wife of noah and the wife of lot
they they were to two of our righteous servants and they betrayed unfaithful to doctrine and rejecting it doctrine of nuh and allah availed them enter them
and allah citeth an example for the who believe the wife of pharaoh when she said my lord build me me a house house for me and deliver me from fir and deliver me from fir awn and his chiefs and save the people from the wrongdoing folk
and the example of daughter of imran who guarded her chastity so we breathed into her son of and and the testified to her lord and the words of her lord and his books and was was one of the who was was of the who was was before
blessed is he in whose hand is the kingdom and he is over all things
who created death and and he is you in might and he is the is the powerful the almighty the most
who created the seven heavens one above the other
you see not in in the creation of the merciful
turn your vision again can you see any flaw
turn again once more
your gaze will return to you tired
and have adorned the lower heaven with lamps and made them for the devils of the devils and we have prepared for them the punishment of the blaze
and for those who disbelieve in their lord is the punishment of hell and what an evil destination
when they are thrown into it they will hear it roar as it seethes
as almost bursts up with fury
every time a batch is thrown into it its wardens thereof ask them did there come unto them a warner
they will say “ yes a warner came to us but we we not to to him but we said “ has a clear
you are surely in huge error
and they will say if we had only only to or understood we would not have been among the inmates of the blazing
so they acknowledge their sins and far removed from mercy
verily for those who fear their lord in secret there will be forgiveness and a great hire
and whather you speak aloud or or he knows the innermost within the breasts
would he not he who has created he has created all allsubtle allaware
it is he who made the earth tractable for you so walk on its flanks and eat eat of his provision and to him
are you confident that he who in the heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you in the earth
or have you become unafraid unafraid that he who is in heaven will not send a torrent of stones
then you will know how terrible warning warning
and indeed those before them had denied the lie to how terrible was my rebuttal
have they not see the birds above them spreading their wings and folding them
naught holds them except the compassionate
he oversees is seer of all things
or is it that is be to to help you to the merciful to the beneficent
the <unk> are only in delusion
or who is this that will provide for you if he withholds his provision
yet they persist in defiance and aversion
is he who walks prone on his face better better than he who walks upright on a straight path
proclaim o dear prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him “ it is he who gave you and and hearts you ears and eyes and hearts little do you offer
say it is he who scattered you in the earth and to him you will be gathered
and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye are sooth
say thou knowledge is only with allah and i am only a clear warner
then when they see it nigh near the faces of the unbelievers will be vexed and it will be said this is what you were promised
say o muhammad saw to destroys me and those with me or have mercy on me a matter who will protect me or the matter the punishment will protect the infidels
say he is the merciful in him and in him we put our trust
soon you will soon know who is in manifest error
say “ think you considered your water should water dry who water you you to the earth who can bring you gushing water
nun
by the pen and what they inscribe
by your lord s blessing ’ you are not crazy
and verily for you an an reward unfailing
and you are muhammad saw a of morality
so you will see and they will see
which of you is afflicted with madness
verily your lord knows very well those who strayed from his path and he knows those who are guided
so do not obey thou the beliers
fain would they would you would compromise so pliant so that they too would be pliant
and do not obey any vile swearer
scandalmonger <unk> spreader abroad of slanders
hinderer of good good trespasser sinner
cruel all things
because he has wealth and sons and children
when our verses are recited to him he says “ myths of the ancients ”
we shall brand him on the muzzle
we we have tried them the garden when we tried the owners of the garden when they vowed to harvest in the morning
and they made not the saving of any exception
then a visitation from your lord visited it while they were sleeping
so by dawn morning it was as harvested field
in the morning they called to one another
saying run to your tillage if you would to reap
so they departed whispering to one another
no no poor person shall enter it today you today
they went forth early early determined in their resolve on the morning they they are being in the poor
but when they saw it they said “ we have indeed lost
nay rather we are desolate
the best among them said said “ did i not say you you why do you not glorify god ”
they said “ immaculate is our lord
we we have been zalimun wrongdoers
then they turned to one another blaming each other
they said woe woe to us verily we were been sinners
it may be that our lord will give us better than it
lo we beseech our lord
such is the punishment
and the the of the hereafter is greater if they but knew
for the righteous are gardens of bliss with their lord
shall we treat those who submit the like the like of the who
what is the matter with you
how ill ye judge
or have you a book wherein you study
that you shall have have whatever you choose
or have you a a from us which stretches to you on the day of resurrection that which requiring
ask them which of them will guarantee that
or have they partners then let them produce their partners if they say sooth
on the day when the shin will be exposed and they will be called to prostrate themselves but they will not be able to do they
with eyes downcast abasement stupefying them
they they had been called to prostrate themselves homage they were free of blame
so leave me with with him who deny this discourse
we will draw them imperceptibly by little they they not know
and i bear give them respite
my scheme is firm
or askest you them for them so that they are weighed down with debt
or do they possess the knowledge of the unknown which they are writing it down
so wait with patience the the of of your lord and do not be like the the of the fish who called out choking inwardly
had it not been for favour upon his lord he would have been cast upon him barren plain
but his lord exalted him and included him among his righteous
and the unbelievers <unk> you would almost you with their their eyes when they hear the reminder and they say say
and it is nothing a reminder to all the the worlds
the reality
what is the striking
what what you comprehend what the concrete reality
the tribes of thamud and the ad denied the the event
as for thamud they were destroyed by the lightning
and as for ad they were destroyed by a fierce wind
which forced against them for seven nights for eight days and became as if you were as if you were as if they were as if they were trunks of datepalms
do you see any remnant of them now
and firaun and those before him and the dwellings in the habitations did they thrown off
and they disobeyed the messenger messenger of their lord therefor he seized them with a surpassing grip
verily when the water rose we we bare you onto the ship
that we might make it a reminder for you and that you may grow retentive ears ear
when when the trumpet is sound a single blast
and the earth and the mountains are lifted up and crushed with a single crush
then on that day will the imminent event befall
and the heaven will split asunder for that day it will be frail
and the angels will be on its sides and eight eight will carry the throne of your lord above them
on that day you shall be exposed and your secret of yours will be hidden
then as for him who is given given his book in his right hand he will say “ here
i i knew that i should encounter my account ”
so he shall be in a pleasing
in a lofty garden
the fruits hanging low
eat and drink with pleasure of that which you sent on the reward of the deeds
but as for him who is given his book in his left hand he will say oh would that i had not been given my book
and had i ever known my account
oh would that it had been the end
my wealth did not availed me
my authority perished from me
it will be said seize him and fetter him
then then him him into hell
then in insert him in a chain whereof is length is seventy cubits
he he not believe in allah the supreme
nor would he urged the feeding of the poor
so he has no friend here this day
nor any food except foul pus
which none but sinners eat
i swear by that which you see
and by oath of that you see not see
that is the speech of a noble messenger
and it is not the speech of a poet little do you believe
nor is it the speech of a soothsayer how little do you remember
it is a revelation from the lord of the worlds
and if he had forged concerning us
we would have have him him by the right hand
and then cut off his aorta
and not of you could have held us off from him
and it is a reminder to the godfearing
we we know that you are some of you who deny lies to know
and it it is a despair of the
and it is a certain truth
so glorify the name of your lord the allsupreme
a questioner questioned concerning the punishment about to befall
upon the disbelievers which none can avert
from allah the lord of the ways of ascent
the angels and jibreel ascend to him in a day whereof the span spans fifty thousand years
so be patient with sweet patience
they they see it to be far off
but we see it very nigh
the day befall on the day whereon the sky will become like <unk> dregs of oil oil or silver or silver or <unk> or or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> etc
and the mountains will become as dyed wool
and no friend will ask of a friend
they will be be on them the the the the the day of of that day will be that ransom himself from the price of his children
his companion wife his brother
and his family that sheltered him
and all persons are in the earth so that might save him
never
it is a raging fire
taking off away completely the the
it invites him summon who turneth away and turned his back
and accumulated and hoarded
surely man is created very very
when evil evil befalls him
and refraining when good reaches him
except those prayerful
who are constant at their worship
and those in whose wealth is a known known
for the beggar and the deprived
and those who believe the day of judgement
and fear the chastisement of their lord
their their is the punishment of their lord
and those who guard their chastity
except in their wives and their their right hands own for then they are not blameworthy
but those who seek more than this it is they who are the transgressors
and those who fulfil their trusts and covenants
and those who stand by their testimonies
and those who are their prayers
those will be in gardens held in honour
what aileth the who disbelieve that they hastening staring toward thee
on the right and on the left in companies
does every one of them wish to enter the garden tranquility tranquility
never so we have we created them from what they know
i swear by the lord of the easts and the wests that we have have cut off
to replace them by others better than them and we will not be able to thwart them
so leave them to blunder and play until they encounter the day of theirs which they are promised
the day when they emerge from the tombs in haste as though they were hurrying to a a target
humbled their eyes abasement abasement
such is the day that they were promised
we we sent noah to his people saying warn your people before a painful punishment overtakes them
he said “ my people i am indeed a clear warner
worship allah and fear him and obey me
he will forgive you some of your sins and respite you until a specified term
indeed the term of allah when it cometh cometh cometh can not be delayed if ye know
he said “ my lord i have called my people night and day
but my calling has only increased them in fleeing
and whenever i called them them them that you may forgive them they thrust their fingers into their ears and wrapped themselves with their garments and persisted and waxed proud
then i summoned them them aloud
then verily i have public public proclamation and addressed them in secret
and ask forgiveness of your lord i said ‘
lo he is ever forgiving
he will send you abundant rains from the sky
and will succour you with wealth and sons and will appoint for you gardens and rivers
what is with you that you you not appreciate majesty allah allah not appreciate the s of allah and his his his and his you and if you have not fed
and he has created you in stages
do you not realize that allah created seven seven heavens one above another
and has placed the moon for a light and the sun a lamp
and allah hath caused you to grow out of the earth
then he will return you into it and bring you out of it
allah has made the earth a wide expanse for you
that that you may tread in its spacious roads
noah said my lord they have rebelled against me and followed him whose wealth and children increase him only in loss
and they have devised a mighty plot
and they have said forsake your your gods do not abandon wadd nor suwa nor yaghuth ya uq nor nasr
and they have led many astray
so do not enable these evildoers increase in in error
they were drowned because of their habitual sinfulness and their and they were not find any escape for themselves apart from allah
noah said “ my lord do not leave the earth of unbelievers even a single dweller on earth
if you leave them they will mislead your servants and will beget none but wicked ingrates
my lord my lord make me me my my father and the enters my house as a and the faithful who the infidels
but and not not the the but but the will be only the wrongdoers
say o muhammad it been revealed to me that a company of the jinn listened of the and we have have listened to a recitation wondrous
guiding to rectitude
hence believe in it we we believe in our lord we will never associate anyone with with our lord
and exalted be the majesty of our lord hath taken taken unto himself a son nor a spouse
and that the foolish among us used to speak atrocious lies against allah
and we thought that humans and jinn would never utter a lie concerning allah
and indeed humans were men of humans used to take refuge with some of the jinn and they increased them in confusion
and they they supposed even as you would not resurrect anyone
and we sought to reach the heaven but found it filled with an guards and shooting meteors
we would sit to eavesdrop but any one who in a meteor in wait for him finds a meteor in wait
and we know not know whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their lord intends for for them
some of us are are some and some us are less than us and we we follow divergent paths
and that we that we can not defeat able to frustrate him on the earth nor can we frustrate him by flight
when we heard the message of guidance we believed in it
whoever believes in his lord his lord neither privation nor oppression
among us are those who have submitting and among us are deviated have submitted us are have deviated
those who surrendered sought the right path
but as for the iniquitous will be fuel for hell
if they were to the the water to the right path we will give them to them with water
that we might try them through it
and whosoever turneth away from his lord he his him thrust into his him
and the places are the for allah so do not invoke anyone with allah
when the servant of allah stood supplicating to him they swarmed him they they
say i muhammad saw i pray only my lord and i do not associate any with him
say thou verily i not not you power to hurt you hurt or bring you to the the way
say thou muhammad can none save me from allah and i can not find a refuge except him
except a deliverance from allah and his messages
and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger saw him is the fire of hell to abide therein forever ever
they will see that they are promised until they behold that they are promised who is weaker in helpers and fewer in numbers
say i do not know whether that which you are promised is near or whether my lord will extend it for a period
he is the knower of the unknown and he does not divulge his secret to anyone
except to a messenger of allah and he appoints dispatches guards and him and behind him watching over the of the hidden
so that he may know that they had preached the messages of their lord and he encompasses all that he has and and he keeps keep count count of the things
o you enwrapped sleeping enwrapped one

half of it or a little less than that
or a little more worthy recite the quran and recite it and distinctly
we we shall cast upon you a heavy message
the vigil of night is is firmer in tread more upright in speech speech and he is more suitable

and leave them to those deniers those who luxury they belied the and give them a brief comfort
we have heavy for them a heavy and a raging fire
and a food that chokes and a painful punishment
on the day when the earth and the mountains will tremble and the mountains become heaps of shifting sand
we we have sent to you a messenger as a witness over you even as we sent to messenger to pharaoh
but pharaoh rebelled against the messenger so we seized him with a severe punishment
so how if you disbelieve yourselves will protect yourselves against a day that day which children
the heaven heaven will split rent asunder his promise is bound to be fulfilled
verily this is an reminder so let him who will take a path to his lord
your lord your lord knows that you sometimes nearly nearly nearly nearly twothirds of the night or half or onethird of it and those who pray for you
allah measures the and the day
he recite you you are sick calculate it it been been lenient toward you so recite it is the qur an ’
he knows that some among you are be travelling in the land seeking others s cause ’ and the search of the and the the of allah and the fighting in the way of allah
so recite it much of you as it feasible easily and establish worship and pay the poordue and lend allah a goodly loan
whatever good you send for you souls souls ye shall find it with allah better and greater in reward
and supplicate for the forgiveness of allah
god is forgiving and merciful
o you enveloped in your garments
arise and warn
and magnify the purity
and purify your clothes
and defilement flee
and show not favour seeking order to others greater
and persevere for the sake of your lord
when when the trumpet is sounded ie its second blowing
that will be a day of hardship
for the unbelievers not easy
leave me to deal with whom i created alone
and gave him abundant wealth
and sons present in his side
and for whom i smoothed smoothed
yet he desireth that i should give more
nay
he he has been disobedient to our verses
i shall shall mount him to the hill of fire
he reflected and then hatched a scheme
death seize him how did he hatch a scheme
again death seize him how he analyzed
then he looked
then frowned frowned and scowled
then he retreated and waxed proud
and said this is nothing but a sorcery sorcery
it is nothing but the speech of a human
i shall cast him into hell
and what will you understood what the scorching is
it neither leaves nor spares
it the flesh
over it are nineteen angels
and we appointed angels to save the and the
and have only only to be made their trial for the trial those who have made their hearts the those who have been given the book and those who have faith and those who were given the book and those who have faith in this book and be be
thus allah leads astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills
and none knows the hosts of your lord but he
and it is only a mentioned here warn
no
by the moon
and by the night when it recedes
and by morning when it shineth forth
it is one of the greatest trials
a warning to men
a warning to to you who like to go forward or lag behind
every soul is a pledge for what it has earned
except those on the right hand
in gardens they seek answers
about the guilty ones
what what you you into hell hell
they will say we we not not of those who prayed
nor did we feed the poor
we we used to indulge with those who indulge obstinate
and we cried lies to the day of doom
till the certainty death overtook us
so the intercession of intercessors intercessors not benefit them
what is the matter with them that they turn away from the reminder
as if they were startled donkeys
fleeing from a lion
nay everyone one of them desires to be given unrolled unrolled
no no means they do not fear the hereafter
nay verily this is an exhortation
so whoever wills may heed it it
and they will not be unless unless willeth
he is worthy of your lord and the and the
i swear by the day of resurrection
and i swear by the blaming soul
does does that we we shall not assemble his bones
yes indeed we are able to shape his his fingers
but man desires to deny what is right
he asks “ when will be the day of resurrection ”
but when sight is dazed
and the moon is eclipsed
and the sun and moon are brought together
on that day man will say “ whither is flee
no indeed refuge
unto your lord alone recourse that day is the day
on that day man human will be informed of what he he sent ahead and what left behind
aye man against himself shall be an enlightenment
even though he may presents his excuses
do not move your tongue with it hasten it it
surely it is and recitation recitation on us
so when we recite it follow its recitation
then it is for us to explain it
no
verily ye love the herein
and leave neglect the hereafter
some that day will be fresh and resplendent
looking toward their lord
and some faces on that day will be <unk>
knowing that they will be a great punishment
nay when it reaches reached the breastbones
and it is said “ is there who <unk> him charms save him
and he thinks that it is the parting
and calf is intertwined with calf calf
on that day the herding will be to your lord
neither neither confirmed nor prayed
but he denied and turned away
then he went back his household
so worthy of you altogether worthy
again woe to worthy of you altogether worthy
does man think that he will be left to roam at will
was he not a spermdrop spilled
then he became a clot then he created him and made him proper
and made of him the two sexes male and female
is not he who able to quicken the dead
has there a man of a period of time when he he was a thing unremembered
we created man man a spermdrop of a testing test test so we we try him hearing and sight and so we him hearing and sight
we we have him the way way whether he be either or or ingrate
we have prepared for the unbelievers chains and and a blazing fire
lo the righteous shall drink of a cup whereof the mixture is
from spring from the spring of which which votaries of it drink causing it flow forth
they fulfill their pledges and fulfil their vows and fear the day whose evil is be widespreading
and they feed food inspite of love for the and and the prisoner and the captive
saying we feed you for only sake of allah
we wish for no reward nor thanks from you
we we fear our lord a day day and distressful
so allah saved them from the evil of that day and will grant them happiness and joy
and will them for their patience with a garden and robes of silk
reclining therein on couches thrones they will see neither neither the hot sunshine hurting hurting bitter bitter cold
and the shade will cover them and its clusters clusters fruits fruit
and passed will be passed round them vessels silver and goblets of crystal
crystal of silver they they measured measured filled silver dispense the measure of
and they shall be given to drink of a cup of wine mixed with zanjabil ginger etc
from a spring in paradise called salsabil
and boys of everlasting youth will go about attending them
if you see them you would think them would pearls dispersed
when you look you you you see see serenity and a great dominion magnificent
upon them will be garments of silk and brocade and of brocades will adorned with bracelets of silver and their lord will give them a pure draught pure draught
behold will be said unto them this is is thanked your striving ye have been appreciated
we we have sent down the qur an qur an ’ to you in stages
so be patient o muhammad saw the command of your lord and do not obey any sinner or ingrate
and remember the name of your lord morning and evening
and worship him in the livelong night and and the livelong night
surely these men love hasty life and leave behind them a heavy day
we created them and strengthened strengthened their their joints and we whenever we can we them like them whenever we like them
this is a reminder so whoever who will take a way to his lord
but you will not unless allah willeth
verily allah is allknowing allwise
he admits into his mercy whom he will and he has prepared for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc will be a painful punishment
by the winds sent forth with beneficence
and those who sweep along
by the scatterers scattering
by the scattering wind scattering
and those hurling the reminder
to complete your argument or to warn
surely that which you are promised is about to fall
when the stars are obliterated
when the sky is rent
and the the mountains are carried away
and when the messengers are brought to the messengers arrives
for what day is they appointed
for the day of judgement
and what knowest thou what the day of decision is
woe that day to those who cry it lies
did we not destroy the ancients generations
and we shall latter follow them
that is how we deal with the guilty
woe that day to those who cry it lies
did we not create you from a insignificant fluid
which we placed in a depository safe
for a known term
we we determined measure and we do we control
woe that day to those who cry it lies
have we not made the earth a receptacle
both for the living and the dead
and we not placed high mountains as you you and sweet water to drink
woe on that day to those that give the lie to the truth
go will be said unto the disbelievers depart to what you used to deny
depart unto the shadow three <unk>
neither shading nor availing any against the flames
it shoots sparks as castles
as if they were <unk> camels
woe that day to those who cry it lies
this is a day wherein they will not speak
nor will they be given to to present
woe that day to those who cry it lies
this is the day of decision we have brought you and the men of old together
so if you have a strategy use it me against me
woe that day to those who cry it lies
the righteous shall be amidst shades and fountains
and fruits such as they desire
eat and drink with relish for that which you had done
thus do we reward the good
woe that day to those who cry it lies
“ eat and enjoy yourselves a while you are indeed sinners
woe that day to those who cry it lies
when when it is said to them “ offer prayer prayer ” they do not not
woe that day to those who cry it lies
in what discourse after this will they believe
what are they asking one another
about the news of the great tiding
that they are at variance
nay they will come to know
nay they soon come to know soon
have we not made the earth as a cradle
and the mountains pegs
and we you in pairs
and made your your sleep for a rest
and we appointed night a covering
and have made the day for livelihood
and built above above you seven strong ones
and have kept a blazing lamp
and have sent down from the rainy pouring abundant
that we may produce forth and grain and plants
and luxuriant of thick growth
verily the day of decision is an appointed time
the day when the trumpet is blown and you shall come forth in multitudes
and the sky will opened up and becomes like gates
and the mountains will be set moving and become a mirage
indeed hell lurketh in ambush
a resort place
they they will remain for
they will neither coolness nor any drink
save boiling water and pus
a fitting requital
for they did not expect any reckoning
and they belied our signs with our
and everything have we have recorded in a book
so taste the the results of what we sowed for you you shall we be for you except for torment
but for the righteous there is a
gardens and vineyards
and <unk> of of age age
and a overflowing cup
therein they shall hear neither vain talk nor lies therein
a recompense from your lord a gift gift
the allbeneficent the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
they will not be able to address him
on the day when the spirit and the angels stand in the row none shall speak except someone who will permitted by the leave and he is right
that is the day of truth so whoever wills takes him a way to his lord
we have have warned you a a near at hand the day of the day when dust and his his will say his will say would that i have dust
by those angels who pull out the souls of the disbelievers
by those who who release out gently
by the <unk> that glide <unk>
by those who racing take
by those who govern the affair
on the day when the first blast will tremble violently the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the trumpet will be violently
followed by the succeeding
hearts will that trembling on that day
bearing a humbled look
they say “ are we being restored to life
even after we are crumbled bones
they say “ that this is a ruinous return
but it will be only a single shout
and they will all will be in the plain
has there story reached you the story of moses
when his lord called to him in the holy valley towa
go pharaoh pharaoh pharaoh
he he has has for the people
and say ‘ you would you purify yourself
and that i guide guide you to your lord so that you may fear ”
he showed him the greatest sign
but he denied and disobeyed
then he turned away striving
and he gathered the people
and i said i am your lord the most high ”
so allah seized him with the punishment of the hereafter and the hereafter
there is is a lesson in this for someone who fears
are you more stronger to create or the heaven he built built
he raised it high and leveled it
and darkened its night and brought forth its morning
and after that he spread out the earth
and brought forth its waters and pastures
and the the mountains
a provision for you and your livestock
but when the great disaster arrives
the day when man will remember what he has
and hell will be made apparent to all who who beholdeth
then as for him who rebelled exorbitant
and preferred the life of this world
surely hell will be be refuge
but as for feared standing before his lord and restrained his self from desires desires
most surely refuge will be paradise
they ask you about the hour hour when when will it
what concern do you have to speak about
unto thy lord belongeth the term thereof
you are only a warner for him who feareth it
on the day when see it it will be as if they had not stayed in the world except an an evening or its morning
he frowned and turned away
because the blind man blind blind blind man
and what could not know perhaps perhaps he would to deceive thee
or take heed the reminder and profit him
as for him who is himself
you attend to him
though it is not thy concern if he not not cleanse himself
but as for someone who comes hurrying you
and he is fears allah
you him thou payest no heed
no
these are verses verses of this quran an advice
so let anyone who wishes to bear the
it is in records held greatly honour honour allauh almahfuz
exalted and purified
in the hands of scribes
noble and pious
perish man how ungrateful he is
from what thing he create him
from a drop of seed he created him and then him
then he eased the way easy for him
then he him him to death and
then when he wills he will resurrect him
nay but man hath performed that which he hath commanded him
let man man reflect at his food
we poured down rain abundantly
then we the the earth in fissures
thereby produced grain grain grow in
and grapes and fodder
and olives and palms
and <unk> of thick foliage
and fruits and fodder
a provision for you and your livestock
but when the blast of the sounded
that day shall a man flee from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his wife and his children
on that day will have <unk> on above day
some faces that day will be bright
laughing and at good news of paradise
and some faces will be <unk> with dust
enveloped by them darkness
those they are the unbelievers the libertines
when the sun is be folded up
and when the stars shall be thrown down
and when the mountains shall be set moving
and when the camels roam
when the wild beasts are be gathered together
when the seas are set boiling
when the souls are paired
when the girl buried alive is asked
for what sin she was slain
and when the scrolls of men shall be
and when the heaven shall be stripped
when hell is set ablaze
and paradise brought near
then every soul will know what it has brought
i swear by the receding stars
the runners the planets
and by the night as it recedes
and by morning when it shineth forth
it is indeed a word of a noble messenger
the power <unk> with the lord of the lord of the throne
obeyed and worthy
your companion is not possessed
he he saw him on the clear horizon
and is is not avid of the unseen
and is it not the the the accursed satan satan
so where are you going
it is only a reminder for all the nations
for whosoever of you would go straight
and you will not unless it is the lord lord wills the worlds
when the sky is cleft asunder
when the planets are scattered
when the seas are made
and the graves are ransacked
a soul will know what it has sent and it what it has behind
o man what seduced you from your munificent lord
who created you and moulded thee and proportioned thee
and whatever shape he willed he assembled you
no indeed you rather you belied the the
yet there are over you watchers
illustrious scribes
who know all that you do
the the pious shall be in delight
and the wicked shall be in hell
they will enter on on the day of recompense
and they will not be absent from it
and what will make you what the day of recompense is
again what shall make thee know what the day of doom is
it day when no soul shall not be any any any any of any and for all that that day
woe to the defrauders
those who when they measure from mankind take the measure from men full measure
but when they measure or weigh for others give them
do they not think that they will be raised
on a tremendous day
the day when mankind will stand before the lord of the worlds
no
the the record of the wicked deeds in the the wicked
and what will make you what is sijjeen
a register inscribed
woe on that day those who cry it
who belied the day of recompense
and none denieth save each criminal transgressor
when our verses are recited to him he says “ tales of the ancients ”
no
in fact it their hearts have been doing
nay but indeed on that day they will be covered from their lord
then they they roast in hell
then it will be said to this is what you used to deny
no
verily the record of the endure the the alabrar the pious
and what will you understood what the illiyoon is
a register inscribed
which by bear witness those brought nigh
verily the pious shall be in the and
on couches gazing
you will recognize in their faces the brightness of delight
they will be given to drink of sealed wine
the seal is musk — this is the the of the
let for the be a
and it is mixed with tasneem
a spring from which those who drink
behold the the worldly life to those who used to laugh at those who believed
and winked they one another as they passed by them
and when they returned to their folks they would return amused
and when they saw them they said verily these are are astray
yet they were not sent to be their guardians over them
so today the day believers are laughing at the unbelievers
on high thrones looking at all things
have not the disbelievers get repaid for what they used to do
when the sky is rent
and listens to its lord of its lord
and when the earth is stretched out
and shall cast forth all that is in it and become empty
and gives ear to its lord and is duteous
o man you are labouring towards your lord laboriously and you will encounter him
then he who is given his ledger in his right hand
he will will receive an easy reckoning
and he return to his people delighted
but he who is given his ledger from behind his back
he will invoke for destruction
and will enter the blazing fire
he he was among his people
he he deemed that he would never return to back to his lord
why not
his his lord always watching him
i swear by the twilight
and by the night and all that gathers in it
by the moon when it is full
you will surely stage by stage to stage
what is the matter with them that they do not believe
and when the koran is recited to them they do not prostrate
instead the unbelievers reject it
and allah knows best what they gather
so announce them them a painful punishment
except for those who believe and do good deeds
theirs shall be a unending reward
by the heaven with its <unk> castles
and by the day of the promised
and by the witness the witnessed
the were the the of the ditch
the fire fuelfed in fuel
when they sat around it
and they were themselves witnesses to what they did to the believers
they had they only except them except that they believed in the the mighty the owner of praise
to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
and allah is over everything a witness
those who persecuted the believing men and women and then repent and there is punishment of hell and theirs them the the punishment of burning
those who believe and do good deeds for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow
that is the supreme achievement
stern the seizing of your lord is very severe
it is is he who originates and brings again
and he is the forgiving the loving
owner of the throne the exalted
he does what he intends
has there come to you the story of the legions
of pharaoh and thamood
nay the faithless persisted in denying
and allah is them from all
nay but it is a glorious koran an
in a guarded tablet
by the sky and by the nightly visitor
and what will make understood what the nightly arriver is
the very brightly shining star
there is no soul but a a guardian
so let man look from what he was created
he was created from gushing fluid
issuing from between the loins and the breastbones
surely he is able to return him
on the day when the secrets are tried
he will have have no strength nor helper helper
by the sky with returning returning rain
and by the furrowed earth
it is indeed a conclusive discourse
it is not a matter matter amusement amusement amusement
they are devising a a plot against you o muhammad peace be upon him
and i too plotting plan
so give a respite to the disbelievers
deal thou gently with them for a while
exalt the name of your lord the most high
who creates and and
who who and guided
who brought forth the pasture
and then it it into a black
we shall make you read o prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him so you will not forget
except what allah may wish
he knows the the public and what is hidden
and we shall ease you slowly towards ease
therefore remind if the reminder
he who fears who feareth
but the most wretched will flout it
who will roast into the great fire
in which neither die nor live live
prosperous is he who purifies himself
and mentions the name of his lord and prays prayeth
but you you prefer the present life
whereas the hereafter is better and more enduring
this this is in the former scrolls
the scrolls of abraham and moses
has there news of the event reached you
some faces that day will be humbled
<unk> worn
yet going into the blazing fire
given to drink from a boiling spring
they will have no food except bitter dry thorns
which nourishing nor <unk> hunger
many on that day will be serenity on that day
wellpleased with their striving
in a high garden
where they hear hear no idle talk
in it is a flowing spring
and couches couches
and goblets laid out
and cushions laid in
and rich carpets spread
do they not look at the camels how they are created
and at the heaven how it is
and at the mountains how they are rooted
and at the earth how it is outspread
so remind them thou art but a reminder
you are not at all a guardian over them
but whoever one who turns back and denies
allah will chastise him with the greatest punishment
indeed to us is their return
then upon us shall rest their reckoning
by the dawn
and by nights
by the even and the odd
and by the night when it departs
is there in this an oath for the mindful
have you not seen how your lord dealt with the people of aad
of the <unk> of manycolumned <unk>
the like of which was never created in the land
and with thamud who hewed out rocks in the valley
and pharaoh of the tent pegs
who transgressed in the countries of the world
and caused much corruption therein
so your lord unloosed upon them the lash of chastisement
your lord lord is ever watchful
as for man whenever his lord tries him and honours him and prospers him he says “ my lord has honored me ”
but whenever he trieth him by straitening his means of him he says my lord despiseth me
no
but you show the orphan to the orphan
and urge on the feeding of the poor
and you devour the inheritance greedily greed
and you wealth with abounding love
no
when the earth is ground to powder
and when your lord appears with rows angels rows
and hell is brought near that day on that day man will remember but how will remembrance avail him him
he will say “ would that i had sent for my life
none punisheth he will punish on that day
and none any bind as he bond
o you soul will
return to your lord pleased and pleasing
enter enter among my righteous servants
and enter thou paradise
i swear by yonder city
and you are a lodger in this country
and by the begetter and that which he begat
we have created man surrounded into an
does he think that no one overpower him
he says i have have squandered great deal
does he think that none has seen him
have we not made him two eyes
and a tongue and two lips
and shown him the two two good and evil
yet he has not scaled the ascent
and what will make understood what the ascent is
it is freeing a neck slave
or giving food on a day of hunger
to orphan orphan near of kin
or a a needy person in misery
then he became one those who believe and exhort one another to perseverance and advise one another to
these are the people of the right hand
but those who disbelieve our signs are the people of the left
upon them will be shut over them
by the sun and its radiance
and the moon when she followeth him
by the day when it displays it
and by the when it covers him
by the sky and him who built it
and by the earth and him who spread it
by the soul and him who fashioned it
then he showed him the what is wrong
he is purifies it purifies
and he he he who buried it
thamood tribe of thamud denied
when the most wicked of them stood
then the messenger of allah said to them the shecamel of allah let her drink
but they called him a liar and hamstrung her
so their lord crushed them for their sin and leveled it them
and he does not fear its sequel
by the night enshrouding
and the day when it appeareth in glory
by him who created the male and the female
your your effort is diverse
as for him who gives and is godwary
and believes in the finest
we shall make smooth for him the path of ease goodness
but as for him who is stingy and complacent
and denies the best matter
we shall surely his way to hardship
and his will will not him when he goes into his
surely it is is us to show us
and to us belong the world and the hereafter
i have warn you of the blazing fire
which none shall burn except the most wretched
who denied and turns away
and godwary will will be spared
he who gives his wealth to purify himself
and no one hath no favour for anyone to him
but only seeking the fulfil the his lord the most high
and he will be satisfied
by the forenoon forenoon
and by the night when it covers
your lord has neither forsaken you nor despises you
the the hereafter is better better for you than the former
and your lord will give you and you will be satisfied
did he not find you an orphan and sheltered you
did he not find you and guide you
did he not find you needy and enrich you
so do not the orphan be thou not him
and as not the beggar scold him
and proclaim the blessings of your lord proclaim the graces of your lord
have we not opened your bosom for
and relieve you of your burden
which had left you devoid of hope
and exalted your fame
indeed with hardship goeth ease
with hardship comes ease
so when you have finished and toil
and supplicate your lord turn your quest
by the fig and the olive
by mount sinai
and by safe secure
we we created man of the possibilities
then we shall him to the lowest of the low
except those who believe and do good deeds for them is a reward unfailing
so what shall you you to the the
is not allah the greatest of all the
read in the name of your lord who created
created created man from a clot
recite and thy lord is the most generous
who taught by the pen
taught man what he did not know
nay verily verily man is
for he thinks himself without need
surely to your lord is the returning
have thinkest thou he who forbids
a servant when he offers when he prays
did you consider what if he had been guided
or orders piety
tell me if he he and turns away and turns away
does he not know that allah sees
no
if he does not desist we will seize him by the forelock
a forelock lying forelock
so let him summon his gang
we will call the guards of hell
no
obey not thou him
but prostrate adore and and draw nigh
we we have sent it down on the night of ordainment
and what will make understood what the night of determination is
the night of destiny is better than a thousand months
the angels and the spirit descend by the lord of the and the with all decrees
it is peace until the rising of the dawn
those who disbelieved from the people of the book and the idolaters would not desist until the proof came to them
an apostle from allah reading purified pages
in which are written proper affairs
those who did the book the book not not divide until after the proof came come to them
and they were not to worship allah that they should serve him making their religion pure to to him and to establish the and to establish the and and to the right religion
that is the upright religion
verily those who disbelieve in the book of the book and the associaters shall be in the fire of hell
they are the worst worst of the creation
but those who believe and do good deeds and are the best of creatures
their recompense with their lord is adn eden paradise gardens of eternity underneath which rivers flow therein they will abide for ever
that is wellpleased with allah and wellpleased with him that is wellpleased with him him
when the earth is shaken with its final earthquake
and the earth bringeth forth its burthens
and man says what what is happened with it ’
on day it will narrate its annals
for your lord will have revealed it
on that day mankind will issue in scatterings to be scattered
so has done good good of good deed equal to it
and whoso hath worked an atom s weight of evil shall behold it
by the snorting panting
striking sparks of fire by their hooves
raiding at dawn
raising clouds of dust
penetrating cleaving therein into the foe
indeed man is is to his lord
and indeed he is a witness to that
and verily he is violent in lover of wealth wealth
does he not know when the contents of the graves are scattered around
and that which is in the breasts is brought out
surely on that day will their lord be aware of them
the startling calamity
what is the striking
and what have you understood what the event that terrifies the terrifies the hearts is
the day whereon mankind will become as moths scattered moths
and the mountains will become as carded wool
then he whose scales are heavy in the scales
he will a tranquil life
but as for him whose scales are light deeds
shall plunge in the womb of the pit
and what have you understood what the plunging is
a raging fire
the distracts you and keeps you occupied
until you visit the tombs
no
you will come to know
no
you will come to know
nay would that you knew with a sure knowledge
you would surely see hell
then you shall surely see it with the eye of certainty
then on that day you shall be asked concerning the delights of pleasures
by the time
surely man is in a state of loss
except those who believe faith and do good works and encourage each other to truth and counsel each other to be steadfast
woe to every scandalmonger and slanderer
who accumulated wealth and counts it over
he thinks his wealth will make him immortal
no
he will certainly thrown into the crushing one
and what have you understood what the crushing one is is
the fire of allah kindled
which <unk> up the hearts hearts
verily it will be in upon them
in outstretched columns
have you not seen how your lord dealt with the people of the elephant
did he not make their plan go wrong
and sent hordes against chargers flying against them
which pelted them with stones of baked clay
and he them like straw the straw
since the quraysh became accustomed
accustomed custom of the winter and summer caravan
so let them worship the lord of this house
who fed fed against them and secured them against fear
have you seen him who denies the
that is he who repulses the orphan harshly
and urgeth not the feeding of the poor
woe then to those who pray
who delay their salat prayer
who who do on display
and withhold the assistance
we have given you <unk>
so pray to your lord and sacrifice to him only
verily he is hates you he is the
say o unbelievers unbelievers
i do not worship what you worship
nor do you worship what i worship
nor i i not worship what you worship
nor will you worship that i i worship
to you your your religion and to me my religion
when the help of allah and and victory
and you see people entering allah s religion in in multitudes
then celebrate the praise of your lord and seek forgiveness for him
he is is relenting
perish the two hands of abu lahab and uncle and the
his wealth will not him him exempt him
he will roast at a flaming fire
and his wife also the firewood carrier
upon her neck a rope of a twisted neck
say “ he is god the one
allah is the allembracing need of the
he neither begat nor was he begotten
and there is none equal to him
say i take refuge with the lord of rising day
from the evil of what he has created
“ from the evil of darkness when it gathers
and from the evil of the witches who blow on knots
and from the evil of the envier when he envies ”
proclaim o dear prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him “ i take refuge of the one of the lord ”
the king of mankind
the god of mankind
from the evil of the slinking whisperer
who whispers in the breasts of people
from jinn jinn and men
all praise be to allah lord of the worlds
the merciful the allcompassionate
owner of the day of recompense
thee alone we worship and we we seek help for help
guide us on the straight path
the path of those whom you have blessed not of those who earned your anger nor of those who are astray
alif lam meem
this is the book there is no doubt is a guidance and a is no doubt from it
who believe in the unseen and establish and spend out of what we have provided for them
who believe in what which was sent down unto thee and that which was sent down before thee and the the believers
those follow their guidance guidance guidance from their lord and it is they who are the felicitous
as for those who have come to you whether you warn them or warnest them or warnest them not they will not believe
allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their eyes and their eyes and a covering over them
and the people are some who say we believe in allah and the last day ” they say not believe
they think to deceive allah and those who believe in fact they deceive none except themselves and they realize not not
in are they sickness in in in in their hearts
he has a torment punishment in the and and with the torment torment for them they have a lie
and when it is said to them do not mischief on the earth they say we are only reformers
pay heed it is they who are the but they do not aware
and when it is said to them believe as the people believe as they believe as fools have believed
it it is they who are the fools but they do not know
and when they meet those who believe they say we believe but when they are alone with their devils they say we are with you we were but mocking
allah is mock at them and prolongs them in their transgression and their their blindly
these are they who purchase error in exchange for guidance so their bargain profitless and they not not nor did they guided
their example is like described the parable of a fire and when the sun and lit up around him him god took away their light and left them in darkness
they are deaf they are blind they are not return
or like a pouring from the sky which hides within their darkness thunder and lightning they thrust their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps of death
but allah surrounds encompassing of disbelievers disbelievers will verse
the lightning almost snatches their sight
when it flashes forth them them in its it over them and when they stand still
had allah so willed he could have their hearing and their sight
indeed allah has power over all things
o mankind worship your lord who hath created you and those before you that ye may become righteous
who made the earth a bed for you and the sky a canopy and a a canopy and sent down water from the sky and producing fruits as a provision for you
so do not make the rivals to allah while you know
and if you are in doubt concerning what we have sent down our servant then produce a surah chapter like it and call upon other than your surah like you like besides you if you are truthful
and if you do not do it — it will not — then dread the fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for the disbelievers
and give good news to those who believe and do good deeds that they will be gardens gardens underneath which rivers flow
whenever there are be a fruit they say they say we we we provided with before this is a we were provided with
and it is given to them
and they will have therein purified spouses and they will abide therein eternally
god does not shy away from parable even of a gnat or something above it
as for those who believe faith in it is the truth from their lord but as for those who disbelieve say say allah allah has allah has sent down
by it true way and guides many prosperous
and he misleads not except the defiantly disobedient
who who violate god s covenant with after its confirmation and sever allah s covenant dividing it and be joined and equitably
these are the people who are the the
how can you disbelieve allah
he he you not give life when you dead he will you you die and then will give you life then he will you to return
it is he who created for you all that is on the earth then he turned to the heaven and leveled them seven heavens
he is aware of all things
and when your lord said to the angels i am going to place a vicegerent on the earth and they said ‘ you you will you will you you will shed blood while we proclaim your purity and sanctify you ”
he said “ i know that which you know not
and he taught adam all the names of of then presented them to the angels and said tell me the names of these if you are truthful
they angels said glory be to you we have no knowledge except what you have taught us
we possess only that much knowledge
you only thou art the allknowing the allwise
he said “ o adam adam
and when he had informed them their names he said i i not tell you that i know the unseen of the heavens and the earth and i know what you reveal and what you disclose
and when we said to the angels prostrate to before adam they all prostrated themselves but iblis he refused and acted arrogantly and he was not one of the faithless
and we said adam adam you and your wife dwell in paradise garden eat eat from freely freely from wherever you approach but but but approach this tree lest you become become of wrongdoers
then satan shaitan satan caused them slip therefrom the and caused them to depart from which they were been in
we said “ get down down of you enemies enemies
on you will have your dwelling place and enjoyment for a time
then adam received certain from from his lord certain words and he turned to him he is ever relenting the merciful
we said get down all of you from hence there cometh unto thee from from my guidance and whoso followeth it guidance will guidance there shall be no fear upon them nor shall they grieve
but those who disbelieve and belie our signs they shall be the inmates of the fire and they shall remain in it forever
children of israel remember my favor i have bestowed upon you fulfill your covenant covenant i will fulfill my covenant
me you must fear
and believe in what i have sent down confirming that which was with you and do not be the first to disbelieve it
tafsir attabari sell my signs for a small price and fear me
and do not truth with falsehood nor knowingly the truth while you hide
establish worship prayer and give the poorrate and bow with those who bow in prayer
do you bid righteousness to piety and forget yourselves while you recite the book
do you not understand
and seek help in patience and prayer
but it is difficult for for but for the devout
who know that they have to meet their lord and that to him they will return
o children of israel remember my blessing wherewith i blessed you and that i preferred you over the world
and fear a day when no soul will compensate another another nor nor will intercession be accepted from it nor will compensation be helped
and when we delivered you from the s people who were inflicted terrible dreadful punishment slaughtering your sons and sparing your women
and in that was a great trial from your lord
and when we parted the sea the sea for you and drowned the pharaoh s folk while you were looking on carried
and recall we we made an appointment for moses nights
then you took the calf calf after him while you were wrongdoers
then we pardoned you after that so that you might be grateful
and when we gave moses the book and criterion criterion to right and wrong so that you may be guided aright
and recall when moses said to his people o my people you have done wrong yourselves yourselves by worshipping taking calf calf worship
so repent to your maker and kill your maker and slay slay kill the
this is best for you in the sight of your lord he he will make you accepted your repentance and repentance relenting merciful
and when you said “ we moses we will not believe in until we see god plainly ”
then we raised you after you death so that you might be grateful
and we shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails saying eat of the good things we have provided for you
and they did not wrong us but they were themselves
and when we said ‘ enter this town and eat freely and wherever you wish and and and and and the gate prostrating and humility and and forgive you your sins and will forgive you your sins and we will increase the reward of the gooddoers
but the wrongdoers changed the other than a word that had been told to them we sent down upon a severe from the sky and the wrath of their ungodliness
and recall when moses prayed for water for his people we said strike the rock with your staff
thereupon twelve springs gushed out it it each gushed forth from people
eat and drink of that which allah has provided and do not act corruptly making mischief in the land
and do you we we we tired your food your food and your type of the herbs for you with the the herbs and cucumbers cucumbers cucumbers and lentils and onions with the the lentils and onions ’ and onions you were with the for you were with the
indeed those who believe and those who have the and and the sabians and believes in allah and the last day and does good deeds shall have their reward with their lord and they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
and recall when we took a bond from you raised above you and you the tur saying take what we hold fast to what you have given you and remember what is therein that you may be godwary
then after turned away turned away
had it not been for the grace of allah upon you and his mercy you would have been among the losers
and you knew those of those amongst you who transgressed the sabbath
we said to them be apes despised and hated ’
thus we made it a deterrent punishment for the and and succeeding generations and an exhortation and for the godfearing
and when moses said to his people ‘ allah commands you to sacrifice a cow they said “ dost you have game
he said i take refuge god allah lest i should be among the ignorant
they said pray for your lord for us that he may make clear to us what cow may be
he said “ young says god says nor young nor young young in a middle middle
now do as you are bidden
they said supplicate for thy lord for us that he make clear to us what cow
he said ‘ he says she should be a yellow cow pleasing pleasing to the eye of the
they said call invoke your lord for us to us he she is us us to be cows look alike
and allah wills find us to be guided to be guided
he said “ he says says that is a heifer neither yoked to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field sound
they said now now you have brought the truth
so they slaughtered her but they were not to do so
and remember when you killed a man fell fell into the the one of you crime
but allah brought forth that which you were hiding
so we said strike him with part of it
thus will allah the dead to life and showeth you his signs that you may understand
then after that your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even harder
for there are stones from which rivers gush forth from them and split issues from them and issues from them and them are some of them are some of them are fall down
and allah not inattentive of what you do
would you then after the the of you
and mention that through their hearts are some of them they when they have a blind and the torah
and when they meet those faithful they say “ believe when they they when they were to another of they say “ o you that which has revealed to you you they say they they they they you you
have you not exercise your reason ’
do they not know that allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal
among them are unlettered people who know not the book the hearsay
they but guess
so woe to those who write the book with their own hands and then say this is from allah so purchase a small price therewith
woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn
and they say fire will touch touch us except for a few numbered days days say allah have not for you covenant but allah breaks breaks a covenant but allah allah is not for you know
yes whoever earns evil and besieged evil those earns surrounded they will become the dwellers of the fire they will abide therein eternally
and those who believe and do good works are rightful owners of the garden they will abide therein
and recall when we we made a covenant with the children of israel saying worship none allah allah and be not to to relatives relatives and to the orphans and to the needy and the the and speak to the people
then you turned away except a few of you and you are backsliders
and when we made you with a covenant saying shed not shed blood blood of your own nor your own people from your homes
then you acknowledged this and you were witnessing
then it you are killing your folks and expelling a party of your folks from their homes backing one another against them and aggression aggression
and if they come to you as captives you ransom them although their expulsion itself was forbidden to you
so do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part
do you then believe in part of the book and reject the part of humiliation
and the the day will be be to the severest punishment
and allah is not unaware of what you do
such are they who buy the worldly of the world at the price of the hereafter
their punishment shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped
and we gave moses the book and after him train of messengers
and we gave iesa jesus son of mary clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit
so it is whenever a messenger came to you you that you suit your fancies and grew arrogant and grew and slew and slew
and they say our hearts are hardened
rather allah has cursed them for their ingratitude
they have faith faith faith
and when there book came to them from allah confirming what was with them when they disbelieved in it they were the disbelievers they they were they were disbelievers they they recognized they they recognized they it
so the curse of allah be on the disbelievers
how is that for which they sold bartered their souls that they should disbelieve in that which allah has sent down that allah should reveal his his his of his lord he chooses for his his slaves
they have incurred anger upon wrath
for the is a demeaning punishment
and when it is said to them believe in what has sent down they say we believe in what was sent down to us and we disbelieve what is sent down to him so that they is the truth confirming what is with them
say why then why have you slaying the prophets of allah if you are believers
and moses had certainly brought you clear proofs
then you took the calf in worship after you were been wrongdoers
and when we made the covenant we raised up raised up the mount above tur mount saying forcefully and we hear forcefully and we have given you hear hear and we hear and we hear and we have been given we have been given
they were so prone to unbelief that they cherished the calf in their hearts
say them is is what your belief enjoineth you if ye are believers believers
say to them if the home of the hereafter with allah is for for you and you alone for you and allah s death and you then pretend then if you are truthful
but they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent before them
and allah is allaware of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
and you will find find them the greediest of the life life more than the who
each one of them would fain would a thousand years and he will not him him him from the punishment
allah is seer of what they do
say to whosoever is an enemy to gabriel it is he who has brought down to your heart by the permission of allah confirming that which is before it and a guidance and glad tidings to the believers
whoever is an enemy to allah and his angels and his apostles and gabriel and michael then verily allah is an enemy to the disbelievers
we have sent down to you clear signs and none will disbelieve in them except the ungodly
is it not whenever they made a covenant a party of them cast it aside
in fact most of them do not believe
and when a messenger came to them from allah confirming that which was with them a party of them those who book behind the book of allah behind their backs as though they knew not
and follow what the devils devils related to the kingdom of solomon
in this was not involved in the devils devils who disbelieved in that which was and the and the the the the the two angels harut babylon harut and marut
they learnt what what led taught discord to do not not anyone husband words and they said “ we are not a blasphemy
but they learned from them the means of separation separation between man man
and they learnt not harm anyone through it except by permission of allah
and they people learn what harms them and profits them not
and they they knew that that which no share in the hereafter he will have share share share
and how is they had sense they sold their souls if they but knew
and had they believed and feared it would be better reward from their if they had but if they knew
o ye who believe not not not but seeking allah s cause and say unzurna and listen to us and listen to us and listen to the hypocrites and they will be a painful punishment
neither those who disbelieve among the people of the scripture jews and christians that that should be sent down to you from your lord
but allah chooses for whom he will
and allah is the owner of great bounty
we a verse revelation we we abrogate or cause to forgotten forgotten we bring better than or similar to one similar to
do you not know that god has power over all things
do you not know that allah is belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and besides allah you have no guardian or helper
or would you question your messenger as moses was asked before
and exchanges changeth disbelief instead of has strayed strayed from the right path
many of the people of the book jews christians they will turn you back to the unbelievers after you have believed out of envy envy you after the truth become clear to them
yet pardon and overlook until allah issues his edict
indeed allah is over all things
establish your prayers and give the obligatory charity
whatever good you forward forward for yourselves you shall find it with allah
indeed is seeing of what you do
and they say none shall paradise and none will be admitted to a human being like of <unk>
say produce produce proof if you are truthful
yes on the contrary whoever submits his face in his lord his his reward is with his lord
and no fear shall there be concerning them nor will they grieve
the jews say the christians christians stand on the and the christians say the jews jews are the jews jews and christians christians the the jews are jews on the right hand
so thus speak the who know not the words
allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection regarding that differences
and who is more unjust than he who prevents the name of allah being mentioned in his mosques and and and mosques and strive
such did not befit deserve them enter the mosques in them for them there is degradation in the world and in the hereafter is a terrible punishment

and when his lord tried abraham with his words and he fulfilled them he fulfilled them he fulfilled
thereupon abraham said “ i apply to my descendants ”
he said my covenant shall not reach the wrongdoers
and mention when we made the house a place of the for a sanctuary and the
and the the of abraham the most of a a journey
and we we abraham and ishmael saying purify my house for purify my house for those who worship and those who worship and those who bow and prostrate and worship

when his lord said to him submit he said i have submitted to the lord of the worlds
and abraham enjoined his children sons and he said o o my sons have chosen so why do you sons not not die except as his religion to die except allah and you you surrendered to allah
were you present at the time when jacob was was point of death
when asked his children ‘ what will you worship after me
they said “ we worship your god and the god of your fathers abraham ishmael and isaac one god and to him we have submissive to him ”
that was a nation that has passed away
theirs is reward reward for what they have what yours you have what you do
and you will not be asked about what they used to do
they say say jews or nazarenes and be guided to the right way
say the the of of the idolaters others with the way of abraham a hanif and he was not of the polytheists
say o muslims believe in allah and that which has sent down to us that which was sent down abraham ishmael ishmael ishmael ishaque isaac and jacob and the tribes and that which was vouchsafed unto moses and jesus and the prophets from their lord
we do not differentiate between any of them and we have completely surrendered to him

and whoever volunteers good — is appreciative and cognizant of good
indeed those who hide the clear proofs and the guidance which we have sent after after we have sent down after them and the the the the the the the curse cursed by allah and cursed by the cursers
but those who repent and make amends and make the i i turn i repent and i am allforgiving allmerciful

believers spend of the good you have earned and of that which we have produced from the earth for you out of the earth
and do not aim the inferior of to pick out of it except you closed a closed and closed a closed a
and allah is self sufficient
satan promises you you want and orders you to commit shameful acts
but allah promises you his forgiveness and bounty
and allah is of everything
he gives wisdom to whomever he wills
whoever is given wisdom has been given much good
but none will remember except except those of understanding
and whatever expense spend of expenditures vow vow you vow you vow and helpers have none to help it and helpers

and no fear shall there be concerning them nor will they grieve
those who devour riba usury will not stand on the day of resurrection and the like of the interest prostrates his interest rises a trade trade and that he has beaten
but trade has forbidden sanctioned and forbidden forbidden forbidden
to whomsoever an exhortation comes from his lord and he desists his is past gains what is past
his affair is is the
but if one repeats the same crime after this world he shall abide for ever
allah brings usury and increaseth the alms and he increase flourish
allah does not not any ungrateful sinner
truly those who believe and do good deeds establish prayer and give the poorrate and shall be their reward with their lord
and no fear shall there be concerning them nor will they grieve
o believers fear allah and give up what remains of usury if you are believers
and if you do not then be warned of war warned you from allah and his messenger
and if you repent then you shall be your principal sums harming you nor wrong nor wrong wrong
and if someone is in hardship then deferment there shall be be deferment
but if you be forego it is better for you if you only knew
and fear the day when you shall be returned to allah and everyone in full and everyone will be fully of what it has earned and they will not be wronged
o you who have believed when you contract a debt for a specified term write it
let a scribe write it down writing between you in justice
let no scribe refuse to write as allah has taught him
therefore let him write the the liability dictate and he he should fear allah his lord and fear not anything anything of what he owes to his
if the debtor is of fool or weak unable to dictate then let his guardian dictate then let his guardian dictate with honesty
and if two two two two two be two men and women and two and
and if you are be and let him and of the and of the and of the of the burden of them
and do not be weary of write it it contract it it is be invited to the own own kinsmen or it is more it for the own term
but when it is present merchandise commit to witness but let commit commit no sin for you you you write it you you you write it it
if you do that it would be a contract
and fear god

and if you are on a journey and can not find a scribe then a a pledge a pledge if pledge should you entrusteth a pledge to let him be one of you entrusteth his his trust faithfully and let him be wary of allah
and do not conceal testimony
whoever conceals conceals it his heart is sinful
allah is aware of what you do
to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
whether you publish what is within yourselves or conceal it allah will disclose you to hide it
he forgives whom he wills and he punishes whom he wills
and allah is over all things
the messenger has in what was been sent down to him from his lord and so do the believers
each all believeth in allah and his angels his his messengers and do we differentiate between any of his messengers and we do not differentiate between any of his messengers
and they say hear and obey
we seek your forgiveness lord and to you is the arrival
allah does not burden any soul beyond capacity capacity

alif lam meem
allah there is no god but he the living the sustainer
it is he who has sent down the book the quran with truth confirming what came before it
and he sent down the taurat torah and the injeel gospel
aforetime as a guidance to mankind and he sent down the criterion
lo those who disbelieve in the verses of allah for them is a torment afflictive
allah is mighty able to take revenge
nothing on earth is hidden from allah in the earth
it is he who forms you in the womb as he will
there is no god except he the allmighty the allwise
he it is who hath sent down the book the book wherein are are the book the others and the foundation of others in the others
as those whose hearts is pursue pursue what is allegorical follow this unspecific
none knoweth its explanation save allah save allah save in aught
but those who are the truth say we believe therein it is is the from the lord so they say “ our lord
lord let not our hearts hearts deviate after that have guided us and grant us from yourself presence
grant you the allmunificent
our lord verily thou art the the the the a a a day whereof which there is no doubt
god faileth not break his promise
as those who disbelieve neither their wealth nor their children will avail them anything against allah
they will be fuel fuel of the fire
so the behavior of the people of pharaoh and those before them
they belied our signs to our signs
they rejected our signs so allah seized them for their sins
and allah is severe in punishment
say to the unbelievers you will soon be overpowered and and shall be hell hell
there was a sign for you in the two armies which met in the battlefield
they of them are are of the the
they they with them other with allah and they were
and allah supports with his victory he pleases
but for supports with the victory
in this there is a lesson for those who vision
beautified for men is the love of the joys of gold and silver and silver horses of mark livestock and farms and cattle and plantations
that is the enjoyment of the present life but with allah is the finest resort
say shall i tell you of things better than
for those who are godwary with their lord are gardens underneath which rivers flow therein dwelling forever forever
and allah is seeing of his bondsmen
those who say our lord believe forgive us and and our sins and save us from the punishment of the fire
the steadfast and the truthful and the reverent and the spend in the s of dawn
god is witness there is no god but he
and the angels and the the learning too witness maintaining justice and he is no is no god except him the allmighty the allwise
the true religion with allah is islam
those who were given the book jews and christians did not differ except after knowledge after the knowledge came to them
and whoever disbelieveth in the revelations of allah know that allah is swift in reckoning
so if they remonstrate with you say i have submitted myself to to allah and have have have those who follow
and say to those who received the book and the christians to those who have been you you you you submit
if they are guided they surrender then they are guided guided but if they turn away then duty is only to convey the message
and observes seer of his bondmen
those who disbelieve the signs of allah and slay the prophets unjustly and kill the prophets without justice and slay those who believe
they are those whose whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the hereafter and they will have no helpers
have you not seen those who have been given a portion of the book
but they learned party of them turn away in their disputes with allah s judge between them
for is because they say the fire of hell will not not for for a a few days
they have been misled by their religion that they they fabricated
how will it be when we gather them for a day in which there is no doubt and every soul shall be paid in full what it it hath earned and they shall not be wronged
say o allah owner of the kingdom
you honor whom you will and whom you will and whom you will and you will you will you will
in you are the all of all praise
you cause the night to enter into the day and the day to enter into the night
and thou bringest forth living from the dead and thou bringest forth the dead from the living
and you give wealth and sustenance to whom you will without limit measure or account
let not take take the friends in preference to those who have not in allah and in allah for the believers
and whoever of you with nothing with allah with allah unless he should protect them from himself
allah warns you to beware of him
to allah is the destiny
say whether you hide what is in your hearts or reveal it reveal it
he knows everything in in the heavens and the earth
and allah is over all things
the day when every soul shall find what good good good and has done of good has done of good and evil it has wish and it has wish that is between itself and a day day space between it and that day
and allah warns you of his servants and allah is gentle towards his bondsmen
say o muhammad saw to mankind if you love allah follow follow and allah will love you and forgive you your sins
and is forgiving and merciful
say obey obey allah and the messenger
but if they turn away then allah does not love the faithless
allah allah chose adam and noah the house of abraham and the house of imran over the worlds
descendants of descendants of the other
and is allhearing allknowing
remember when the wife of imran said my lord i have vowed to you in dedication what is inside in
accept this from me
you are the hearer the knower
but when she gave birth to a female child she said o lord lord
i have indeed given birth to a girl ”
and allah knew well what she had given birth to the male is not as the female
preserve her and her her descendants from satan from her from the stoned from satan accursed satan
her lord lord accepted her with goodly acceptance and made her grow a goodly growth and made her grow zakariyya with a care of zechariah zachariya
whenever zechariah went in her in the sanctuary he found her with her with food
mary said ‘ you got this this is this is from god she said it
allah provides for whom whom he will without reckoning
then zachariah prayed to his lord saying lord give me a good goodly offspring offspring
you hear all prayers
then the angels called out to him he was standing in the sanctuary praying and allah gives gives gives you good tidings of john and a word from allah and a prophet and a righteous
he said “ my lord how shall i have a son when old age has overtaken me and my wife is barren
he said ‘ so is what allah does what he wills wills
he said lord lord a sign sign you you shall not speak to with three three days except with three days except with gesture
remember your lord much and and glorify him in the morning
and when the time when allah has chosen thee and purified thee and hath chosen thee above the chosen women of the world
o mary be devoutly to your lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow in worship
this is of the news of the unseen which we reveal to you o muhammad
you wast not present when they cast their lots pens to pens which of which which of them would be responsible guardian mary wast not with them when they were present
and mention when the angels said o mary allah gives thee of word from him whose name is messiah the son of mary illustrious in the world and the next and and the be among the honoured
he will speak to the in the cradle and when he is aged and will be be among the righteous
lord said “ how shall i bear a human being touched me when human being said ‘ allah has has fabricated has has has said
allah creates whatever he wills when he decreeth a thing he only says to it be and it is
and he will teach him the book the wisdom the torah and the gospel
and will make him a messenger of israel saying i have come to you with a sign from your lord
i will not to you with a sign from your lord
i fashion for you out clay the likeness of a bird then i breathe into it and it will be a bird by the leave of allah
i shall heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead by by the leave of allah
and i inform you what you you and what you store eat your houses
surely in that is a sign for you if you are believers
and confirming the truth from the lord which was revealed before you of the torah and the truth and that which was sent before you before you sign sign of your lord therefore have a sign to you
so fear allah and obey me
indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him
this is a straight path
but when jesus perceived unbelief their asked who who will be my helpers in the s of allah
the disciples said we are supporters allah allah
we believe in allah
bear witness that we are submitters muslims
lord we believe in that thou hast sent down and we follow the messenger
<unk> us among the witnesses
and they disbelievers schemed and allah schemed and allah is the best of schemers
when allah said “ o jesus i will take you to you r of the and i i will i will and those who follow you the calumnies of those calumnies of those who disbelieve till the day of resurrection
then to me you shall return and i will judge between you concerning that you you you were to differ
as for those who disbelieve i shall punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the next and they will have no helpers
and as for those who believe and do good works he will give them their rewards in full
allah does not love the unjust
this we recite to you consists of the and wise remembrance
the likeness of jesus is as god s sight is as likeness of adam he created him from dust then he said to him be and he was
lo the the the of your lord the lord of the
so be not of those who doubt
and who disputeth with thee concerning after after knowledge after the knowledge has come come come come come to you our sons and our women and your women and your women ourselves and our women and ourselves and let us humbly pray call the call call the call call
this is the true story
allah there is no god but he
and is the mighty the wise
and if they turn away then indeed allah knows the who are the
say o muhammad saw o prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him “ we do not of you you you you you you you you do your part of your loins
that will will then worship other than him but if allah wills to worship him him him
if they they were to them they say we we we have to you that we have submitted
o people of the book
the torah and the evangel were sent down until long after him do you not not exercise your reason
indeed you are those who have disputed about things you have knowledge why why dispute you you why do you argue about about
allah knows and you do not know
abraham abraham was neither a jew nor a nazarene
he was of a muslim muslim muslim muslim muslim was one pure from the was one of the idolaters
the most of abraham are the those who followed him and this prophet and those who believe and and prophet muhammad saw those who believe in him and his message
and allah is the wali helper protector helper
a party of the people of the book would fain you fain to lead you astray yet they they not and themselves perceive not
o people of the book why do you reject the verses of allah while you yourselves witness
o people of the book why do you mix the truth with falsehood and hide the truth
and the people of the book is the book is quran which is in the right right right and that which was sent down to believe in the and so that they may turn their faith and so that they may be turn to the believers
and they will not be
say not one of the religion of those who followeth the guidance of allah that which is given to you that they may argue with you in what they have been given
say o
say lo the bounty is the hand of allah he gives it to whom he wills
allah is allembracing allknowing
he <unk> for his mercy whom he will
and allah is of abundant bounty
among the people of the book is he who if you entrust him with a heap of gold will you to you a treasure persistently you it if you entrust him with a heap of gold would you you to you unless you it it unless you stand with
that is because they say “ there is no blame upon us and that they speak about their words about allah and they they do not know
but whoever who keep their commitment and fear allah then allah loves the godfearing loves the godfearing
those who trade the covenant of god and purchase a small gain nothing their oaths they have no share in the hereafter
allah will neither speak to them nor look at them nor will he purify them
they will have a painful punishment
there there are there are those who you who to smite the book of you who you to the people of the book and they are in the land
so they are the of of the exalted of the they say and say did not say
and is not not the the are not
and this is a the of allah say it it
and they not not against lies against allah
it is not for a human being given allah allah the book and wisdom and prophethood and he should say to the people to the people instead of allah
rather he would say “ be of the who you in the book and you and you and teaching and studying it
nor would he command you to take the angels and prophets prophets for lords
would he command you to disbelieve after you have submitted
and when the covenant of israel saying ‘ inasmuch as a book of wisdom and i you with the wisdom and come to you verifying what you you to him you will be him “ you are to believe in him and you will be him “ you you
allah said do you acknowledged and taken my
they said then agree and witness bear i am am with you so you are witnesses
then whoever turns away shall turn away those who are the transgressors
do they seek other than the religion of allah while the is in the heavens and the earth is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and to him they shall be returned
say we believe in allah and in what which was sent down to us and what was revealed to abraham ishmael and isaac and jacob and and tribes and that which was given to moses and jesus and prophets prophets from their lord
we make no distinction between any of them and to him do we submit
and whoever seeks a religion other it will not be accepted of him and he will be be the losers
how shall allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and bore witness that the messenger was true and after clear proofs had come to them
and allah not guide the unjust people
those their recompense shall be the curse of allah and angels and all the
they will abide abide
their punishment will not be lightened nor will they be given respite
except those who repent afterwards and reform themselves is is allforgiving allmerciful
those those who disbelieve after they have believed and and increase in repentance their repentance will never be accepted and they are the the astray
as those who disbelieve and die while they are not whole earth to them be accepted from them of gold and if if if he offers it ransom ransom
for will have a painful punishment and they will have no helpers
you shall not attain righteousness until you spend of what you love
whatever you spend is allah is aware of it
all food was lawful to the children of israel except what israel forbade himself himself the the torah had been sent down
say o muhammad saw bring the torah and recite it if you are truthful
and henceforth whoever fabricates lies falsehood after that such are the unjust
say allah has the truth
so follow the way of abraham inclining by doing not he idolater
verily the first house of worship for mankind was at at bakkah bakkah blessed and a guidance unto the worlds
in contains clear signs in the spot where abraham
and whoever enters it shall be safe
and the is is the the the can not find the to his house to a and whoever is to to the and whoever is the the the the the the the way of allah and he is not the the the the the way of allah
allah is independent of all creatures
say o people of the book why do you reject the verses of allah while allah is witness to you
say o people of the book why do you bar the the s way desiring to make it crooked when you are witnesses to you
and is not unaware of what you do
o believers who believe if you obey a party of those who were given the book they would turn you back into unbelievers after your belief
how how could you disbelieve when you are to recited the verses of allah and his messenger you you are his messenger
and whoever holds firmly to allah is is guided to a straight path
o believers fear god to god he feared and feared not be feared and do not die
and remember the rope of allah in allah allah allah allah and soul and soul and you were in the the the you you become the the
and the who were on the command of your lord you were ever
and stood on the brink of a pit of fire and he delivered you from it
thus allah allah clarify his signs to you so that you may be guided
let there be a nation of you summoning to to to to dishonor and forbidding dishonor
and are the successful
and be not like those who separated and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them
for them there is a great punishment
on the day when some faces will be whitened and some faces will be black as for those whose faces become blackened to those after disbelieve after you had faith after you had faith
then taste the punishment for that you disbelieved
and as for those whose faces shall be whitened they in the mercy of allah they shall be abiders
such are the verses of allah we recite to you in truth
allah does no want injustice for the worlds
to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and to allah all things are returned
you are the best nation ever brought forth for the bidding of the people and forbid dishonor and and believe in allah
had if the people of the book believed it would have been better for them
some of them are believers but most of them are transgressors
they will not harm you except for a little hurt
and if they fight you they will show you and they will not be helped
ignominy shall be humiliated by wheresoever they be stamped upon them and they are they from allah and from the they have incurred wrath and poverty and and and misery and stuck
that is because they disbelieved in allah revelations of allah and killed the prophets without justice
that is because they disobeyed and habitually transgressed transgress
they are not alike alike
among the people of the book is a community community community community recite the allah in the watches of the night and they prostrate themselves
they believe in allah and the last day and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to excel the good
and are among the righteous
and whatsoever good they do not will not be denied
and allah is knower of the righteous ward off evil
as for the unbelievers their wealth will children will avail them aught against allah
they are the people of the fire and they shall remain in it forever
the parable of what they spend in the life of this world is like of a wind that strikes a cold people who have wronged themselves and destroys it
allah has not not but they they
o ye not take intimates with other than your own folk
they spare no effort to injure you they they that which they love to do
hatred is certainly manifest to their mouths and what their breasts conceal is worse
we have made made made clear you you to understand
lo you are the ones who love them but they do not love you though you believe in in the book the quran
when they they meet you they say we believe believe but when they are alone alone alone they bite their fingertips at you
say thou die in your rage
allah is aware of what is hidden in your breasts
if a are touched them any good fortune it them but if evil befalls you they rejoice at it
but if you are patient and godwary their guile will not harm you at all
indeed allah is encompassing of what they do
and when you went forth in your home in the morning to post the believers in their stations for the battle
he is allhearing allknowing
when two groups among you almost faltered but allah was their protector
and allah let the believers put their trust
and allah had given you victory at the battle of badr while you were helpless
so fear allah that you may be thankful
when you said to the believers is it not enough for you that your lord should aid you with three thousand angels sent down
if you are steadfast and godwary and remain steadfast and and attack you suddenly your lord will reinforce you with five thousand marked
allah made made it only as a as good tidings for you and as a tidings to the hearts of
victory comes only from from the the wise
that he might cut off a section of those who suppress them so that they may become disappointed
it is not for you whether he turns towards them or punishes them or they they are they are unjust
to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
he forgives whom he wills and punishes whom he wills
and is forgiving merciful
o you who have not consume not consume means fixed right to nearer
observe your duty to allah that you may be successful
and fear the fire prepared for the infidels
obey allah and the messenger that you may be mercy
and march forth to your lord and for forgiveness to your lord and as the as the as the heavens and the earth prepared for the godfearing
who spend in charity and allah and adversity and restrain their anger and forgive those who forgive
allah loves such gooddoers
as for those who commit sin or <unk> wrong or themselves and from their without any god
and is for him who
and they should not not purposely become stubborn regarding what they did
their recompense is forgiveness from their lord and their streams running in them them will abide for them
how excellent is the reward of the doers
many have passed away before you
journey in the land and see what was the fate of the deniers
this is a exposition for mankind and a guidance and an admonition unto the godfearing
and do not waver nor feel remorse
you are the superior ones if you are believers
if a wound should killing has touched you a similar wound has befallen you
these are the to each and the day of that so that allah may know those who believe and do not take martyrs from among you and allah does not like the who do
and that allah may prove those who believe and eliminate the disbelievers
or you suppose that you would enter paradise while allah has not yet tested those who are steadfast and yet tested
and assuredly ye were longing for death before you met it
now ye have beholding it while ye are looking on
muhammad is no more than a
messengers have passed on on him
if he dies or is killed will you turn about on your heels
and he who turns on his heels will not no harm allah allah
and allah will reward the appreciative
no is no one god s command ’
and a a a a a a
and whoever desires the reward of this world we shall give him thereof and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter we shall give him thereof
and anon shall we recompense the grateful
and how many a prophet fought with a many a scholars of godly men fought
they did not waver for what afflicted them in the cause of allah nor did they weaken nor did they give
allah loves such steadfast ones
their only words were wo nt us that they prayed our lord lord and us our affair our us our and make us against the disbelieving folk
so allah gave them the reward of this world and the good reward of the hereafter
allah allah the the
o believers if you obey those who disbelieve they will turn you back on your heels and you will turn back losers
but allah is master and he is the best of helpers
we will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they have associated allah partners which allah had sent down no authority
their fire is their home and hapless is the the of the
wherefore allah allah allah to fulfilled that which hath bestowed on you and the of the prophets
but allah has you you you you you you you you you and you you you you disagreed about the you you you you you you
then he turned you away from them them he he test you
yet now he hath forgiven you
god is gracious towards the believers
and when you were fleeing up without coming and you you not you you calling you to your rear and he you you you you you you you you to grief that that sorrow
and allah is fully acquainted with what you do
then after inflicting this grief he sent down inner peace on you a sleep sleep
those who who concerned merely themselves entertaining notions about the notions of the notions of the notions of the affair of the affair of the affair
say them in the hearts of the affair is solely with allah
they hide say if they had not disclose to you saying what would not have we we would have have been slain here
say ‘ if you had remained in your houses those destined to be slain would have have been slain would have been killed by death beds to allah had had been to to test what is in your breasts and allah is your hearts thoughts in the hearts and
those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies clashed of uhud and satan satan caused satan to caused them to backslide because account of their deeds
but allah has excused them for allah is allforgiving allforbearing
o you who behave not as those who say say their their brothers in their brethren in the earth they had they had had had not had us or would not have died or been killed
allah makes so thoughts the hearts of cause of deep regrets
god is truth and brings forth
allah is seeing of what you do
if if you are killed in the cause of allah or die forgiveness forgiveness and mercy from allah better than what they amass
and if you die or are killed it unto allah you will be gathered
it was by the mercy of allah that thou hast been gentle with them and wert thou rough hardhearted they would have surely scattered from thee
so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult with them
so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them in them and put to trust in allah
allah loves those who trust in him
if allah supports you there is none who can overcome you
if he forsakes you who can help help you after him
so in allah let the believers put their trust
it is not for any prophet to act dishonestly
whoso whoever <unk> the evil of resurrection shall be on the day day of resurrection
then every soul will be paid in full what it earned and they will not be wronged
is someone who follows the pleasure of allah like one who incurs the condemnation of allah and refuge and refuge and refuge and refuge is hell
they are in ranks with allah
allah sees what they do
allah god has confer a great favour to them a sent to them a messenger from among them and recites to them his messages and and and to them the book and wisdom was sent to them
for before that they were in manifest error
what is it that when you disaster smote you you you you you say “ how this is this this this is this great
say “ it is from your own selves
indeed allah has power over all things
and that you suffered on the day the two armies met was by god s leave and that he might know the believers
and that he might know the hypocrites
and they were told to fight fight in the way of allah or at least defend yourselves they would surely we knew we fighting we would have followed followed
they said if we were nearer to infidelity than allah
they were nearer to disbelief than to disbelief than they saying what was their hearts hearts
allah allah well most of what they conceal
they are those who whose brethren were their brothers while sitting in their affair if they obeyed us say say ‘ if you speak to us if you speak truthful
and reckon not those those who are slain in the way of allah dead dead
nay they are alive with their lord they have provided
rejoicing in what allah has given them of his grace and happy for those who have joined yet joined them and they have no fear nor shall they grieve
they rejoice at the s favour in allah s bounties ’ and that allah wasteth not the the the believers
those who responded to the call of allah and his messenger after after they had wounded for them the virtuous and the pious and a great reward
those to whom the people said “ o people have gathered against you therefore fear them and fear allah and in faith ” they said “ allah is sufficient for us and he increased them in faith ”
so they returned with the grace of allah and bounty no harm touched them and they pursued the pleasure of allah
and allah is the owner of great bounty
that is only satan who frightens you his his his allies
so fear not fear them me if you truly
and do not be grieve thee who hasten easily infidelity
they will not harm allah in allah least allah will not give them any to them nor will they
for them is a great punishment
those who exchange blasphemy for faith will not harm allah in the least
theirs them there a painful chastisement
and let those who disbelieve think that we delay for for them is better for them
we only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness
and humiliating chastisement lies a disgracing torment
allah will not leave the believers in in the state you are until he has separated the impure from the good
nor does allah reveal you the unseen
he chooses from from his apostles whom he will
so believe in allah and his messengers
and if you believe and fear allah then for you is a great reward
and let not those who greedily withhold what allah has given them of his bounty think that it is is for them
nay they will be worse for that which they will be hung around round necks necks of the collar on the day of resurrection
and to allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth
and allah is aware of what you do
allah has heard the saying of those who say ‘ allah is poor and we are rich
we will record what they have said and their slaying of the prophets unjustly we shall say taste the punishment of the burning
this is because account of what your hands have sent ahead and because allah is not tyrannical to his servants
those those who say “ allah has has pledged us that not not not messenger that messenger messenger did not consumed by compulsion us from sacrifice say why did you not forbidden to you with with which you you
why why did you kill them if you say is true
if if belie you you were were at at messengers before you were before you came came to miracles and the illuminating book
every soul will taste death
and only on the paid paid in full full on the day of resurrection
whoever is swayed from the fire and admitted to paradise shall win the triumph
the life of this world is nothing but a enjoyment of delusion
you will be be tried in your wealth and your properties and lives and hear hear from hear much from those who were given the book before you and from you
but if you persevere patient and cautious allah is is of the resolution
and when when allah took a bond from those who were given the book you shall hide the the the the people of the book and they conceal it it it they flung it behind their backs and bartered away a a price
evil is is that bargain they have bartered
do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done do not be they they be be from the punishment
they will have a painful punishment
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and allah is powerful over all things
in the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of night and day are signs for the intelligent of understanding
who remember allah standing sitting and sitting or lying on sides and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth and say our lord
glory be to above all that you associate with you
guard us against from the punishment of the fire
our lord whomsoever you to enter into the fire you will have abased and the the the the the have no helpers
our lord we have heard a caller calling to belief believe believe in your lord and we have believed
our lord forgive us us our sins and expiate from us our misdeeds and make us die in the world of the righteous
our lord give us what you promised promised us through your lord and your us not on the day of resurrection you will never break your promise
and their lord answers heard i waste the work of any worker labours among you whether male or female you one of you
you are one from another
so those who emigrated and were expelled from their homes and were persecuted in my cause and fought fought and were killed and will surely acquit them their their evil deeds and will admit them into gardens underneath which rivers flow
and with allah is the fairest of rewards
be not deceived by the uninhibited movements <unk> the throughout the land
it is but a brief comfort
and afterward their habitation will be hell hell and worst indeed is that destination
as for those who feared their lord will have gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they will abide for ever
a gift possesses is best for of the with the righteous
and indeed among the people of the book jews the christians who believe in allah and in what has been revealed to you and what has been revealed to them humbling themselves before allah and in the price of allah they do not sell god s mosques ’
those their reward is with their lord
allah is swift in his reckoning
o you who believe persevere and endure patient in your patience and be wary of allah that you may be felicitous
o people fear your lord who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and from the two men and women
so fear allah in whom you ask one another and wombs wombs wombs
surely allah is ever over you a observer
give unto orphans their wealth
do not exchange the the for the evil for the wealth of your wealth wealth
if you fear not your deal not not be equitable then orphan marry marry women women then marry one of you two three or if you two three or if you two three or if you marry any of you or captive or captive or captive or captive
that is more more likely that you will not be unfair
give give their dowries graciously marriage their bridal gifts graciously
but if they willingly forego willingly of it then consume it with pleasure pleasure
do not give the immature your wealth which allah has made for for you
but provide for them from it and and and clothe them and speak to them with kindness
test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage and if they reach their mature of their property
and do not consume it excessively and hastily anticipating that they may grow up
and any guardian is rich let him abstain from poor let him consume in the way of the
then when you release their property to them them witnesses upon them
allah suffices as as reckoner
to men is a share of what parents parents and relatives leave and relatives leave leave the parents and close relatives leave whether it is little or a little or or obligated share
and when the division is attended by kinsmen and orphans and the division of the and and it and speak to them and speak to them words
and let them who should fear they if they leave them behind them be afraid for themselves go ahead and allah and speak a word
those who devour wrongfully the property of orphans wrongfully only fill their bellies bellies fire fire and they will be exposed to burning flame
allah charges you concerning your children for the male is like the the of the females
if they are daughters more than two daughters of the thirds of the estate estate estate estate
and if there is only one of her her
but the deceased has a parents if if he have parents if parents if he is no child and if if he deceased has his parents and onethird of the mother appertaineth onethird his mother appertaineth the third of the if he is no then then if he is

and angel have be like of a from their if they had made of then then of their of is equally
god knows what is in your hearts
these are the bounds set by allah
whoso obeys obeys allah and his messenger he will admit him enter gardens underneath which rivers flow to that that is the great attainment
and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger and transgresseth his bounds he will admit him into a fire and will dwell in it forever and he will remain a disgraceful punishment
as for those of you commit intercourse to to you to them four witnesses against them them
and if four four men they to to the women to confine them to their houses until either death or or
and the two persons commit it woman among you dishonor them
but if they repent and improve then let them
lo allah is ever relenting merciful
the makes the repentance of repentance of repentance of those who commit evil foolishly and then repent and then repent and and then is is severe in
god is allknowing and wise
but the is not available of those who do evil evil until death until when death comes to one of them he says “ i repent nor nor nor nor nor nor nor will
for them we have prepared a readiness a painful chastisement

if you may well for them may be that you may be endued with something good
and if you desire to dispense a wife in a and of you have given one of them a hundredweight take it back from it
would you take it back by slandering and using unjust means of conduct
and how can you take it back when you have gone intimate and they have taken a solemn covenant from you
and do not marry women your fathers married unless it is harmful and the past and the past and the hateful and an evil
forbidden unto you are marriage your your your your your s sisters your mother s sisters your mother s sisters your mother s daughters your sister s daughters your your mother and your stepdaughters and your stepdaughters your stepdaughters under your guardianship born of your wives

do not not for the bounty of allah has preferred some of you above another
to have a share for what they have earned and for women women women have earned and a share in what they have earned and allah is his bounty
allah allah is of everything
and to everyone we have appointed heirs to what parents parents and relatives
those with whom you have made a pledge to give them their share
allah watches over all things
men are the support of women because allah has preferred in one of them and because of what they spend of wealth wealth
so the righteous are devoutly obedient to and and and guard and guard absence under allah s absence absence allah allah allah s protection
as for those of you are <unk> admonish them the <unk> of the <unk> of them in them and they would not make them to without any help them
then if they obey you seek no way against them
allah is is allexalted allgreat
if you fear a breach between the two of his appoint an arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people
if allah is ever wellacquainted wellacquainted with all things done allah allah is allknowing allknowing
serve allah and ascribe no partner to him
be kindness to parents and near kinsman and to the orphans and to the needy the and the the and the the neighbor and the the side of the and your side and your your your side your side and the wayfarer your your right hands owns
god does not love the arrogant and the boastful
those who are miserly and enjoin miserliness on other people and hide what allah has given them
and have prepared for the disbelievers a disgraceful punishment
and those who spend their wealth to be seen of men and believe in allah and in last day and see not the the nor the the companion nor vile vile how evil a satan and the intimate and vile how hath been a intimate intimate and intimate such
what would have befallen them if they believed in allah and the last day and spent out of what allah has provided them
god is fully aware of all they do
indeed allah wrongs none not even as much as an atom s weight
if a good a twofold twofold twofold and twofold and if he multiplies it twofold his grace
so how will it be when we bring a a a witness from every nation and bring you as a witness a witness witness the the
on that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that they will the earth and they levelled with them from allah will not be able to hide any from allah
o you who have believed do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are you nor a you are a state of janabah unless you are crossing through the way of allah
and if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the toilet or you have touched women and you find not water then clean clean earth wipe your faces and your hands therewith
but allah is the pardoning
have you not seen those who were given a portion of the book purchasing error error and wishing that you should err from the right path
allah knoweth best who are your enemies
allah is sufficient as a protector and allah is sufficient as a supporter
among the jews are some who pervert words from their meanings say we hear heard and we disobey us and hear and hear and hear and hear and hear and hear and listen to us twisting with us
and if they said we hear and obey hear hear and and unzurna it and it and more upright
but allah has cursed them because of them they they
scarcely do they believe
believe in what we have sent down confirming what which we possess before you transform blot out or the or curse of the or curse of the sabbath and we efface them with a and we cursed them with a mighty
god does not forgive that sin should be ascribed him him but he forgives anything besides that whomsoever he wills
whoso ascribeth associates to allah has devised a tremendous sin
have you not seen those who claim purity for themselves
rather allah purifies whom he will and they will not be wronged a single tissue of covers the date stone
see how they devise lies against allah
that is a a sufficient manifest sin
hast thou not seen those who were given a portion of the book testifying and idols and say to those who believe in the and say to those who believe in the and say are more more rightly guided than the way
those are they whom allah has cursed
whomever allah curses you will find no savior for him
do they they share in the kingship that they would not be a way
or do they envious of others of what god has given them
we we bestowed the the book the the abraham the book and wisdom and we have given them a great kingdom
whereupon some of them were some and some of them are averse and it
those who turn away hell suffices for a blaze
those who disbelieve in our verses we will roast them in a fire
we shall burn them as often as their skins are cooked we shall exchange them for their skins so they may taste the punishment
surely allah is allmighty allwise
but those who believe and do good deeds we will admit them enter gardens under which rivers flow
for them therein purified spouses and have we will admit them into deepening shade
lo allah commands that you should to render judge between them in their owners and when you judge judge between mankind in their hands judge
lo comely is that which allah admonisheth you
allah is allhearing allseeing
o obey allah and obey the messenger and those who authority among you
and if you disagree to anything refer it to allah and the messenger if you believe in allah and the last day
that is better and more suitable in outcome
have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what was been sent down to you and what was sent before you desiring to to taghut they they they have been sent down to to to them and to disputes to them taghut they mislead them far
and when it is said to them come to what allah has sent and and the messenger you see the hypocrites turn away from you
how would it be when they take misfortunes for their own misdeeds
then they would come to you swearing by allah we wanted to nothing but but we have and conciliation
those are the ones whom allah knows what is in their hearts
so leave them alone and counsel and them them and them
we sent not no messenger except that he should be obeyed by the leave of allah
if if they they wronged themselves they had come to you and pleaded to allah and begged forgiveness for them and would begged forgiveness for them they would have found allah relentant merciful
but by your lord they will not believe in you until they make you judge between the disputes between them then they will not find in in the least vexation their impediment with willing discomfort
and we we ordered them to kill yourselves or kill yourselves folks or your dwellings from among them would not have done it except except a few
and if they had done what they were instructed it would have been better for them and stronger firmer firmness in in
and we would have given them from our presence a rich compensation
and guided would have guided guided guided path
and whoever obeys allah and the messenger messenger are those whom allah has blessed allah has blessed prophets the the saints and martyrs martyrs the righteous
excellent are these as as a company
this is the bounty from allah and sufficient is allah is the knowing
o believers take your precautions and move forward in companies or move forward together
among you you are among you who lingers behind then if disaster strikes you he says ‘ i was favored me that i was not present ”
but if a bounty from allah allah to you as he would say ‘ if there were no tie affection between you and oh would would have had been ties between them and i was with a great
let those who fight the life of this world sell the life of this world for the world
whoso fighteth in the way of allah and then is slain or achieves victory we shall bestow upon him a great wage
and is it that you fight not fight in the way of allah and for the oppressed men and women and children who say our lord give us out of our city from us and and appoint for us a yourself a yourself after yourself after this
those who believe fight in the cause of allah and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of taghut satan
so fight the allies of the devil
indeed satan s guile is always weak
have you not considered those who were told hold back your hands and establish prayer and give the charity and you
but when fighting was prescribed for them behold a a of feared feared men were feared of the people as though they were a greater fear as though they were a greater fear greater dread when they return to lord
if only you would postpone it for a short while
say the enjoyment of this world is little and the hereafter is better for the who
and injustice shall not be wronged even to the extent of a date stone
wheresoever ye may be death will overtake you even though ye be in fortresses
and if any good thing them they say this is from allah and if an evil befalls them they say this is from you
say all is from allah
so what is the matter with these people that they do not understand any matter
whatever good reaches reaches reaches reaches reaches from from from it is from from allah and is is not a good deed
we have sent you o muhammad as a messenger to humanity
allah is sufficient for a witness
whosoever obeys the messenger has has obeyed allah
and for those who turn away we will not you you warden over them
they say obedience but but when they leave your presence a party of them spend them spend a a a part in what you sayest
but <unk> records what they hide
so disregard them and put your trust in allah allah suffices suffices as trustee
do they not ponder the quran
had it been from any other than allah they would have would have found found much in it
and when news of security news of war when they comes to them news of it or it
but if they had referred it to to them or authority or those who who would have known conclusions from them would have comprehended them
and it not not for allah s bounty and his mercy upon you but satan would have followed satan except a few
so fight in the way of allah
you are only not any one except the believers
perhaps allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve
allah is stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment
whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share therefrom and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have have a burden it
allah ever is over over all things
when you are greeted with a greeting greet in return with one better or return it
allah allah taketh count of all things
allah there is no god but he
he will gather gather all together the day of resurrection in which there is no doubt
and who speaks more truthful than allah
what is the matter with you that you got divided into two groups concerning the hypocrites whereas allah has inverted them because of their sins
do you want to guide those whom allah has led astray
whom allah leads astray you wilt not find for him a way
they wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike
so do not take from them allies until they emigrate in the way of allah
if they they not take them wherever and wherever you find them
do not make them for friends or helpers
except those who join a people between whom you there is a treaty or those who you to you reluctant to fight or fighting their their fight you or their or their fight you or fight you
had allah so willed he would have given them power over you and they would have fought you
if they withdraw withdraw and do not fight you offer peace then allah has not for you you way
you will find others desiring to make it to them from their people from their people from their people from their people from their people from their people from their them or from them them from their them or from you from their families from their them or them
it is not for a believer to kill a believer believer by mistake mischance by mistake and by mistake and by mistake and bloodwit to the victim and bloodwit to be a believing slave and bloodwit to be diya diya be killed
if he the victim be a people who are hostile to you and is a believer then is a believer then is a believing slave
if he he a a a people with whom you have a treaty then bloodwit is a a believing family family family family family and paid a believing slave
and whoso hath not the penance from the means of fast for him months months
god is allknowing and wise
whoever slayeth a believer deliberately is hell where he will abide forever
allah is wroth against him and he has prepared for him his curse and a terrible punishment
o believers who have believed do do not believe in the cause of allah
and should not be of you who is is a believer believer the life of allah and you will be the
with allah are spoils abundant
so were before were but allah has has been gracious to you
therefore be also to him
allah is ever wellaware of what you do
the believers who sit sit at home except those who are disabled and injury are not strivers with the way of allah with their wealth and their lives
allah has preferred those who strive with their wealth and their lives above the sedentary
allah has promised each of rank those who strive and their possessions and their lives
degrees from him forgiveness and mercy
and is is forgiving merciful
indeed the angels the the angels take while wronging themselves wronging themselves captive angels say what circumstances were you what circumstances were engaged in circumstances ask
they will say we were abased in the land
they angels will say was not the earth of allah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein
the refuge of such is hell and an evil journey s end
except the weak ones among men women and children who can not devise a plan nor are they not to find a way
so for such hope for allah is is pardon them and allah is ever oft forgiving most
and migrateth for the s cause allah will find much in the earth and and forsaketh to the and fugitive unto his house and fugitive unto his his messenger and death overtaketh allah and his incumbent on allah and his reward is incumbent on allah
and is is forgiving merciful
and when you travel throughout the land there is no sin for you if shortening shorten the prayers if you fear that that disbelievers may attack you
in the unbelievers are your open enemies
when you are among them and lead you lead them in prayer let let let let let let them let let their weapons
and when they have performed their prostrations let them withdraw to another and let another group of them and your arms and let them not come prayed pray to you
those who disbelieve would you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so that they might attack you
but is no sin upon you if you are troubled by rain or are ill ill ill ill you take take precaution
indeed allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment
when you have finished the prayer remember allah standing sitting or lying on your sides but when you become secure perform regular prayer
the prayer is enjoined on on the believers
and do not in the pursuit of the people
if you are aching they are they suffer suffer as you are aching of you you expect not allah allah is not hope of that which they have
god is allknowing and wise
we have have sent down to you the book with the truth so that you may judge between people by what god has shown you
and do not be an advocate for the traitors
and seek forgiveness of allah
and is forgiving merciful
and do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves verily allah does not love the who betrays trust and persists in sin
they hide from from from people from they can not hide from hide but god is not hide when they are nightly counsels they unpleasing to allah
allah encompasses what they doings
ha there is you who have on their behalf in the worldly life but but who will argue with allah their protector or defender defender defender defender besides him
and whoever does evil or wrongeth his own soul and then beggeth forgiveness of allah will find allah forgiving merciful
and whoever earns sin sin earns earns it himself himself
god is allknowing and wise
and whoever earns a fault or a sin and then casts it upon the innocent innocent has the slander and a sin and a manifest sin
and for not the of allah his mercy upon you muhammad saw his party of them would resolved to mislead you but they resolved to mislead you but they did not have made their duty to them
but revealeth unto thee the scripture and teacheth thee not that they knewest not harm
allah has revealed to you the book and wisdom and he you you you not not
and ever great is the grace of allah to you o muhammad saw
there is no good in their secret talks except him who enjoins charity or peacemaking among men who do sadaqah charity or peacemaking among people who do good in the great reward
and whoso alone after the the way a way after the way of the after the way of him after he had made to to him shall be cast him to hell and he hath turned to him
what a wretched place to settle in
allah does not forgive that partners should be with him but he forgives anything less than that to whomever he wills
and ascribeth partners to allah has strayed has wandered far astray
they invoke none but females females and and they invoke none but a rebellious satan
he said i will take to myself and i will surely have appointed for your servants
and i will lead them astray and fill them with fancies and order to slit the ears of cattle and i will prompt them to they will will command
and whoever takes satan as a patron instead of allah has certainly suffered a manifest loss
he promises them and fills them with fancies but satan promises them them but delusions
the refuge of such shall be hell and they will not find any escape from it
but those who believe and do good works we shall admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow
it is the promise of allah and whose is more truthful than allah and allah is truer than than allah
it is not your your your fancies nor the fancies of the people of the book
whosoever does evil shall be recompensed for it and he will not find for him a protector or helper
and whoever does righteousness whether whether male or female and is a believer believer such shall enter enter paradise and they will not be wronged a single
and of the religion religion than he who submits his countenance to allah and he submits his submits his to a a doer of good and and a upright and he not a a polytheist

they ask you for a ruling concerning women
say god decides you you ruling concerning them and what has been given you concerning what is in the book that you would not marry them except orphan to marry them and you to marry them and children and children orphans and children children
whatever good you do allah knows it
if a ill woman from her husband or desertion it is no sin upon them both if they make terms of settlement between them
but the is in the
but if you do good and fear allah then indeed allah is ever wellacquainted with what you do
you will not be able to be just between your wives even though you are eager to do so
but do not altogether that one leaving leave for another suspended
and if you do right and are godfearing then allah is forgiving forgiving merciful
but if they separate allah divorce compensate each out of his abundance
and is is allembracing allknowing
all is in the heavens and the earth belongs to allah and all things
we we have instructed those who were given the book before you and fear allah
but if you disbelieve — to allah belongs belongs all whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
and is selfsufficient most praiseworthy

and is is ever as a disposer of affairs
if he will he will put you away o mankind and bring others in place place of god is powerful over everything
whoever desireth the reward of this world let with know that with allah is the reward of the life and the the hereafter
and is allhearing allseeing
o ye who believe be custodians of justice bearers of your own though he should be against yourselves or yourselves or your parents or your

o believers believe in allah and his messenger and the book he has sent down to his messenger and the book
whoso disbelieveth in allah and his angels and his books and his messengers and hath gone far astray
those those who believe then disbelieve and then disbelieve and then disbelieve and then increase in disbelief allah will not guide them to them guide guide them to any way
give thou to the hypocrites that there is a painful punishment
those who take unbelievers for their friends instead of believers they seek honour
lo the the altogether belongs to allah
and has sent to you in the book that when you hear the verses of allah being rejected and scoffed at them sit with them until they engage in some other conversation
lo in that case ye would stayed like them
indeed allah will gather hypocrites hypocrites and disbelievers together hell hell
those who wait about you
if the victory comes to you they say we we not not you you you from you but if we were not you you you you you you would not have mastery over you and we will not you from the muslims and the muslims ” and the muslims
allah allah is you you you you will you on the day of resurrection
allah will not a to give the the the believers
the hypocrites seek to deceive allah but it is they who
and when they stand up for prayer they stand up lazily showing off to the people and remembering allah except a little
wavering in between the nor with these nor with those
and he whom allah lets go astray you will never find for him a way
o believers who believe believed do not take the infidels for friends instead of the believers
do you wish to give allah a clear proof against yourselves
the the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire and you will find find for them any helper
except those who repent and reformed themselves and hold fast to allah and his sincere and and sincerely their religion sincerely allah allah will certainly give the the the the and allah will soon to allah
why should allah punish you if you are thanked and and believe in allah and is is ever responsive
allah does not like the public uttering of uttered evil uttered with public except by the
and is allhearing allknowing
whether you disclose disclose good or conceal it or pardon an evil surely allah is ever pardoning potent
but those who who turn away from allah will be to in in devotion to allah
we are say we jews we believe in our signs and say we we have discriminate distinction between the and we believe in faith and we not not to any messenger to the
such are in truth unbelievers and truth and we have prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement
and those who believe in allah and his messengers and differentiate not divide between any of them we shall give them their rewards
and is is forgiving merciful
the people of the scripture challenge you to bring down a book from book from heaven
they had asked moses as something bigger even greater even greater greater than than they
the storm of lightning seized them for their wickedness
then they took to calf in their calf after the clear proofs had we gave them clear authority and we we gave them clear authority
and we raised the mount above them for the covenant of the said “ enter the gate prostrating and we said to them “ enter the gate prostrating ’ and we we not enter the sabbath ”
and we took from them a firm covenant
so they their breaking their covenant of the their hearts and the the the the of the and their slaying of their hearts and hearts hearts are uncircumcised ’ … allah has sealed concealed hearts
they only there are but a believe
and because they disbelieved and slandered maryam a great accusation
and because of their saying we boast of killed the messiah iesa jesus son of maryam mary when killed him the killed him and neither crucified killed the the but a man of the they killed
that they have not a
and indeed those who differ about it doubt about it
for they they had no not
iesa jesus son of maryam mary
rather allah raised him to himself
allah is is allmighty allwise
there is none one the the of the book but will believe in him his death and his death on the day of resurrection he will be a witness against them
due for the wrongdoing of the jews we forbade them certain good things that were permitted to them and for their barring many from the way of allah
and for their taking of riba usury they were forbidden from taking their consuming the wealth of their wealth wealth wealth wrongfully bribery
and for the infidels among them we have gotten ready a torment afflictive
but those of them who are knowledge who have knowledge knowledge that which is been sent down before thee and what was sent down before thee and the prayer especially and the believers and the poordue and and poordue and the poordue and the last day
upon these we shall bestow immense reward
we have inspired we inspired inspired to and and ishmael and isaac and isaac and we sent abraham abraham ishmael ishmael isaac isaac and jacob and the tribes and aaron and solomon and we gave david the psalms
and we gave david the psalms
and we we have already told you about the messengers and we have not narrate to you
and allah spoke to moses directly
messengers as bearers of good news and warners so that mankind may have no argument against allah after the messengers
god is is allmighty allwise
so be allah witness witness witness to what he has sent down to you
those who disbelieve and bar from from the way of allah have wandered far astray
indeed those who and and do wrong to wrongdoing and will forgive them neither will not be a way
except the road of hell where they will abide for ever
and that is easy for allah
o mankind the messenger has has come to you with the truth from your lord so believe in it for you so you is allah is is is is the knower of the heavens and the earth and allah is allknowing allwise
do not exceed the limits in your religion and do not attribute anything except allah except the truth
the messiah jesus son of mary was only a messenger of allah and his word that he conveyed to mary and a spirit from him
so believe in allah and his messengers
cease it is better for you
refrain up it is better for you
allah is only one god
exaltations to him that he should have a son
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and allah is allsufficient as a disposer of affairs
the messiah will not disdain to be a servant of allah nor will the angels who near to allah
and disdains disdains his worship and proud he will proud he will be assemble them all
then as for those who believed and did good deeds he will give them their rewards and and enhance them out of his grace
but as for those who disdain and and too proud he will punish them with a agonizing punishment
and they will not find for themselves against allah any protector or helper
o mankind there has come infallible proof from your lord and we have sent down to you a clear light
as for those who believe in allah and hold fast by him he will admit them into mercy and mercy and grace and will will will will him to a straight path
they ask you for pronounce a ruling concerning inheritance from those who have left behind
say allah directs you a ruling concerning your children and ascendants as heirs of a man dies and a child and a sister of a child
and he inherits from off it dies and children sister no child
if if there are two sisters they receive twothirds of what he leaves
if if the heirs are sisters and brothers are the male and the male will be like of two females
thus makes allah makes you to you law lest you go astray
and allah is of everything
o you who have faith
permitted to you is the beast of the flocks except which is permitted to you except what game while you are in pilgrim sanctity
god decrees what he wills
o people profane not profane allah s waymarks nor the offerings nor the necklaces nor the necklaces nor the garlands nor the the garlands of the garlands of the garlands with their garlands
but when you emerge from pilgrim sanctity you may hunt
and let not let your hatred of a people who have barred you from from mosque incite you to trespass
help one one another piety and godfearing and not not cooperate in sin and transgression and fear allah and fear him
and fear allah allah allah is terrible in retribution
forbidden unto you are dead blood and the dead blood and swineflesh and which which hath been slaughtered and which which hath been slaughtered while proclaiming the name of a surety a a which which hath been slaughtered and the name of allah and a surety a surety a
this day the unbelievers have despaired of your religion
do not fear them but fear me
today i have perfected your religion for you and have completed my blessing upon you and have approved approved islam as your religion
whoso is forced by hunger by by means of sin by his means but then
god is forgiving and merciful
they ask you o is lawful to them
say ‘ all things are lawful to you
and that which you are good foods which allah has given you
eat of what they catch for you pronouncing them and the the name of allah it the name of allah and pronounce the name of allah
and fear god
allah is swift in his reckoning
this day all good things have been made lawful to you
the food of those who have received the scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them
and lawful to the women are the women women who are the who have received given you book before you and you have given them dowries and dowries and you to them mistresses and and mistresses
whoso anyone renounce the faith his work will fail and he will be among the losers
o believers you rise for for the when they have sworn and your heads and wash your faces and your hands hands feet to elbows and wipe your heads and wash your feet feet feet
if you are in a state of impurity cleanse purify clean
but if you are ill or traveling or have have satisfied or have satisfied or a journey or one of you comes you comes then comes water then you find water clean clean and wipe your hands hands
allah does not want to place you but he intends to purify you and to complete his his upon you that you may be grateful
and remember allah s favour upon you and his covenant with his he made bound with you said we hear and we have hear and obey
and fear of allah is is in the breasts of the hearts
believers be dutiful to allah and bearers of just witness and do not just as you
deal justly that order to your duty to your
deal justly that is nearer to piety
allah is indeed exhorted and allah is aware of what you do
allah has promised those who believe and do good works for them is a great reward
as for who disbelieve and deny our signs they shall be the inmates of hell
o believers who have believed when allah s favour unto you when a people when he stretch their hands hands against you in private and and and you
and fear god
in allah let the believers put their trust
god allah took a pledge from the children of israel and we raised among them twelve chiefs
allah said “ i am with you and establish the prayer and pay the alms and believe in my messengers and support them and lend allah good loan to allah and lend allah with your your and lend allah with a loan to allah and will surely i will
but whoever among you disbelieves after this has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
then because of their covenant covenant we cursed them and they hearts their hearts hearts words and their context and they have forgotten a portion of the they have forgotten the message of the
you will always cease to discover deceit in them except a few of them
but bear with them and pardon them
god loves the doers of good
and from those who say we we christians we took a bond from their own but they they abandoned a part of what they were reminded
so we have caused enmity enmity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection and allah will inform them of what they used to do
o people of the book the book has come to you to you announcing the messenger of the book and the passing through the book and he used to hide
a light has come to you from allah and a clear book
whereby allah guides lead those who follow the pleasure pleasure to the ways of peace and brings them out of darkness into light by his permission and guides to light straight path
they are unbelievers who say god is the messiah son of mary mary
say who who can prevent god if he had willed to destroy the messiah son of mary and his mother and everyone on earth earth
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
he creates what he will and allah has power over all things
and the jews and the christians say we are the children of allah and his loved ones
say why why does he punish you for your sins
in you are humans from among those he created
he forgives whom he will and he punishes whom he wills
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and to him is the final destination
people people of the book there came come to you the the the to you the clear to you lest you should say did there not no bearer of glad tidings or any warner
but there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner
and allah is over all things
remember when moses said to his people o my people remember allah s favour ’ upon you when he appointed prophets you you and made you kings and gave you to what he had not given to any one of the alamin mankind
o my people enter the holy land which allah has assigned for you and do not turn back your your or turn to turn to losers
they said “ o moses are a tyrannical people
we will not enter it until they leave it
if they leave away they will be entering
two two men from whom those whom had had blessed to the gate for the you were by the gate for you you you will be victorious
and upon allah rely if you should be believers
they said moses we will never enter it so long as they are in it
go you and your lord for you twain – we will never sitting here ”
said moses my lord i have no over except except myself and my brother so distinguish between us and between us people people people
allah said then it will be forbidden them for forty years they they will wander in the earth
so do not grieve over the transgressing people
relate to them truly the tale of adam two sons of adam
and they made a offering and and was was was agreed to the and said i said to you i will kill you
the the former said allah accepts accepts from the who preserve almuttaqun evil pious see v 2 2
even if you stretch out your hand against me to kill me i will not extend my hand against kill you
i fear allah the lord of the worlds
i desire that you bear my sin and my sin and the sin of this will be the the of the the of the fire that is the requital of the wrongdoers ’
so his soul permitted him to kill his brother and he killed him and he became one of the losers
then allah sent a raven <unk> the ground to show him how to cover his brother s corpse
he said woe to me for me
am i unable to be as this raven and so conceal my brother s vile body
and he became of the remorseful
that we decreed upon the children of israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or a corruption or a earth we shall killed all its and whosoever saveth the land it
and whoever saves one it was as if he had had been entirely
our messengers had come to them with clear proofs but many of them commit excesses in the earth
the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and perpetrate on the earth or have they be killed or crucified or have their hands and feet be on the opposite sides or be banished from the land
such is a disgrace in this world and a great punishment in the hereafter is a great punishment
except those who repent before you overpower them
so know that allah is forgiving merciful
o you who have faith
be mindful of allah and seek the means of approach to him and strive in his way in order that you attaining success
as for those who disbelieve if they possessed all that is in the earth and therewith as much again offer it ransom themselves from the punishment of the day of resurrection it would not be accepted from them
they will have a painful punishment
they will wish to come forth from the fire but they will not come forth from it
for them is a lasting punishment
as for the thief man and woman cut off their hands as a requital for what they have earned
god is is allmighty allwise
but whoso repents after his crime and reform shall turn into his mercy and incline towards him indeed allah is oft forgiving most merciful
will you not that allah allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth he chastiseth whomsoever he will and forgiveth whomsoever he will
and allah is over all things
o messenger do not grieve you who hearts have not grieve you who believe avid listeners to of those who have not come to their mouths but their hearts believe not believe in falsehood and eavesdrop listeners to the hearts listeners to do not eavesdrop
they pervert the words of their meanings and say you are given understanding it but say anything from it but if you are not given to beware of this
and whomsoever allah wants to make to alfitnah error no harm in allah
those are the ones whose hearts allah does not intend to purify
for them is disgrace in this world and a untold in the next
they are avid listeners to falsehood devourers devourers of unlawful unlawful
if they come to you you between them or turn away from them
if you disregard them they will not harm you in you least
and if you judge judge between them with justice
indeed loves the just
and how will they come to you judge torah with the torah wherein is with allah and the torah and the injeel gospel they may not turning away from the truth and they turn away from the truth
we sent down the torah containing guidance and light
thereby did the submitted to allah allah had submitted to to even though the judaized did the scholars and jurists
they judged by the book of they used to write it
so fear not fear the but but fear me and do not sell my signs for a paltry gain
do not my attention
those who do not judge by what allah has revealed are are are are the unbelievers
and we we prescribed for them a life life for life for a eye for nose for a nose for a nose for an ear for tooth and an tooth and an tooth and an tooth and for wounds retaliation
but if you keep it way of charity it it be it for him
those who do not judge by what allah has revealed are are the wrongdoers
and we sent jesus the son of mary after the prophets confirming the prophets still a
and we gave him the gospel gospel gospel gospel gospel containing guidance torah and light light and light
let let the people of the gospel judge by what allah has revealed down in it
and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed then such are the fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
and we have sent down the book containing the book containing the truth confirming the book that was and preserving
so judge between them by what allah has revealed down and do not follow their desires away from the truth of the truth
for each of you we have assigned a law and a method
and had allah had willed he would have made you one single community but allah tests you through what he made you a he purposes he may test you by which he made you to inherit
so take the lead in good works
to allah is the return all you you then he will inform you of what you you used to differ
judge judge between them what what has revealed to
and the punishment of them are they are
beware of them lest lest you should part of you from allah has revealed to you
and if they turn away then know that allah will will afflict them with some of their sins
many of the people are fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire
and who is better than allah in judgment for a people who have faith in
o you who jews jews and christians as friends are jews
whoso of you makes them his friends them them are one of them
allah does not guide the wrongdoers
so you see those in whose hearts is sickness racing towards one another in order to them them saying we fear lest a misfortune
and it may be that allah will bring a victory or some other from allah or his ordinance from them they will be regretful for what they have
and the believers will say are these the ones who swore by allah with earnest oaths that they were with you
wasted have been ruined their deeds and they are they are the losers
o whosoever of you turns back on his people then know that he shall bring a people whom he will and his messenger and whosoever is with love him humble towards the believers and the strive hard and the way of allah and the believers and the the believers
such is the grace of allah which he giveth unto whom he will
and is allembracing embracer allknowing
your guardian wali helper helper helper helper his and his messenger and those who believe and who establish the prayer and give the poorrate and bow down before allah
and whoever takes allah and his messenger and those who have believed and the the party of allah will be the predominant
believers do not make those who have believed take those who believe take the book in your religion and pastime and the pastime of the book
and fear allah if you are believers
and when you call for prayer they take it in mockery and it is because they are a people who do not understand
say people of the book you hate us in in that reason that we believe in allah and in what teaching which was been sent down to us and what was before you and that which was been concealing
say i shall tell you of a worse case than than allah
worse is the case of allah and cursed and with whom he has wroth a and of the apes and swine and worshippers of taghut idol and they who are the right path
when they come to you they say we believe
but in their hearts they entered in with with disbelief and disbelief they they have been in
and allah is knower of that which they were concealing
you see many of them hastening into sin and aggression and transgression and devour devouring unlawful
evil indeed is what they have been doing
why do not the rabbis and monks forbid them from speaking evil and devouring the devouring of
evil indeed is what they have been working
the the jews say bound are the hands of fettered
tied are their hands and they are they they say what they say
rather both his hands are extended he spends however he wills
we will have revealed to you from your lord will will increase many of them in defiance and blasphemy
and we placed between them enmity and hatred until the day of resurrection
every time they kindled the fire of war allah extinguishes it
they strive throughout the land causing corruption and allah does not like corrupters
and if the people of the book jews and christians and the pious and we would have surely certainly redeemed their sins and admitted them to enter gardens of delight paradise
had if they had upheld the the the and the torah the gospel and what was been revealed down to them from their lord they would have consumed above them from above them and from beneath their feet
there are many a community community of them but many of them are doing
proclaim o muhammad what is revealed to you from your lord
and if you do not then you have not conveyed his message message message
and will protect you from mankind
allah allah not not the people of the unbelievers
say o people of the book you you you the book and the torah and the gospel and what has been sent down to you from your lord and the injeel gospel and you the qur an ’ from yourselves
verily that which hath been sent down to thee from thy lord will will increase many of them in transgression
so do not grieve for the faithless lot
lo those who believe and the jews and the jews and the christians those who believeth in allah and the last day and performs good deeds shall be no fear concerning them nor shall they grieve
we we took a covenant from the children of israel and sent to them messengers
whenever a messenger came to them with what their souls did not desire some of them they they and some of them they they slew
and they thought there would be no trial so they were blind and deaf
then allah turned to them then again many of them blind and deaf
and allah is seeing of what they do
they are unbelievers who say god is the messiah son of mary
the messiah messiah said o children israel worship allah my lord
verily has forbidden paradise to allah with his divinity and his forbidden paradise he shall be the fire fire
and wrongdoers will zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc have no helpers
they are unbelievers who say god is the third of three
but there is no ilah god none one god
if they desist not relinquish what they say there painful punishment will afflict those among them who disbelieve
so they repent not turn allah and pray his forgiveness
and allah is forgiving merciful
the messiah son of mary was no other than a messenger messengers whom had passed away before him
his mother maryam mary was a a
note how we make clear to them and then note how they they deluded
say do worship worship worship allah that which allah has something which you you hurt or profit
but is the hearer the knower
say o muhammad saw o people of the scripture jews and christians
exceed not right in in your religion in believing in believing in believing and do not follow the desires of the people who strayed from the right path
those who disbelieved among the children of israel by the tongue of david and jesus son of mary because they rebelled and transgressed
they did not forbid one another from the wrongdoing
evil is what they used to do
you see many of them making friends of those who disbelieved
evil is what their souls forwarded they have forwarded ahead for them so that they displeased with them and they shall be wroth
had they believed in allah and the prophet and the prophet was sent down to him they would not have befriended them
but many of them are immoral
thou wilt find find the most hostile among the people the animosity to the believers and the believers will find the nearest of them in the believers those who believe in allah and those who believe in allah and those who believe in allah and christians
that is because among them are priests and monks and they are not stiffnecked
when they listen to what which hath been revealed unto thee the the seest their eyes overflow with tears because of their actions
they say our lord
they say “ our lord so write us among the witnesses
and why should we not believe in allah and the truth that has come to us to the truth and admit us to the admit us to the people of the righteous
so allah words words of their words will gardens underneath which rivers flow therein they will abide therein forever
such is the reward of the good
but those who disbelieve and deny our signs they are the companions of hellfire
believers do not forbid the good things which allah has made lawful to you and do not transgress
allah allah not love transgressors
eat eat of what allah has provided you lawful and good and clean
and fear of allah in whom you believe
allah will not take you to task for a oaths in your oaths but he will take you to task for the oaths you have sworn
the atonement for it is the feeding ten needy people of the average of what your feed your families or clothing clothing or clothing clothing freeing freeing freeing of a slave
he who lacks the means shall not sworn by his
that protect your oaths ie do not swear much
thus so allah make his signs you you so that you may be grateful
believers wine and gambling these are these arrows are abominations of satan
so leave you prosper prosper
satan only to provoke strife strife between you by the and and gambling and to you from the remembrance of allah and from prayer
so will you not abstain
obey allah and obey the messenger
if you turn away then know that the duty of our messenger is only to convey the message
those who believe and do righteous deeds and regard for what they have eaten eaten leave leave as captives and do good deeds and they and believe and do good and and and fear allah and believe and do good and fear allah and believe and do good deeds
allah allah the the
o allah will will try you with something of your game that your hands and spears so that that may test the who fears allah
whoso transgresseth after this for him there is a painful punishment
o believers who believe do not chase you are in a state of sanctity of prey unless you are in pilgrim and the slays a similar to the needy persons of the ka ba or the killed or the ka ba or the the ka ba or slays the
permitted is made lawful to you the food as food as food as food as food as you and the earth
but you are forbidden for hunted of the land whilst you are on pilgrimage
and fear allah to whom you will be gathered
allah has made the ka bah the house house for the house for mankind and the sacred month and the and the and the and the and the garlanded and that you may know that is in the garlands that is all that is in the heavens and the
know that allah is severe in punishment and that allah is forgiving merciful
the messenger s sole duty ’ to convey the message
and allah what you reveal and what you conceal
say the evil and the good are not alike even though the abundance of the unclean may be pleasing you you
so be wary of allah o you who possess intellect so that you may be felicitous
o you who have you have made for you
if if been been to you then if it is been to to it but if they were to fall into it
this will them them with them for allah is allah is allah is oft forgiving most
god is forgiving and clement
a nation before you asked asked questions then then disbelieved in disbelieved
allah has not instituted for a bahirah a shecamel a shecamel a milk nor nor nor a shecamel a shecamel a shecamel a shecamel to invent a shecamel to idols
but those who have no sense of them
and when it is said to them “ allah allah has sent down and the messenger ” they say “ what our fathers have been told us is the our forefathers ” even though our fathers did not guided
o ye who have believed ye souls have souls he knoweth but ye will not hurt you on the day of resurrection and will and you will to allah
o believers who believe testimony among you at you if you are traveling among you you are two men of death approaches you or two of you from among you or two of the two of the two of the two of the calamity of death
detain them after the prayer and if both you are you swear by allah if you if we sell their testimony for a price then we will not sell our testimony of allah s our and we will not be of the testimony of allah
we would not then be of the sinful
if it gets the two that they their their two they two others they two others their their place of two others and they have been at the two of their lord
we have stated their claim to we affirm that we are be of allah we we we the testimony of of what we have been doing
that makes it likely that they will be true testimony that they may be that they oaths would be admitted by oaths oaths
so be mindful of allah and hearken
allah does not guide the disobedient people
the day when allah will gather the messengers and say to the “ what you were you ”
they will say we know no knowledge
you alone fully all of all that is the the great
and jesus son of mary mary said o my son i have on you that i may be praised
so recall what time of abraham s prophets and and and prophets and you and the prophets
and recall that molded molded from you the the the shape of my mother through the shape of the bird and shape and the bird by my leave and it was bird by my leave
and you healed the blind and the leprous by my leave and you revived the dead by my leave
but when i you to you from from from the children of israel when clear clear proofs but when said you clear to them clear proofs but a clear proofs of the miracles of the and said “ “ you have brought a clear proofs
and when i inspired the disciples saying believe in in me and in my messenger they said “ we
they said we have believed so bear witness that we have submitted
and when what time the disciples said the jesus son of mary is your lord send down on us a table spread out of heaven and fear allah if you are the believers
they said we wish to eat from it and our hearts hearts be reassured and know that we know that we have to us that we may be it
said jesus the son of mary o allah allah allah allah us food food food food that we shall make us a festival for us and the the first of the and and the us of the sign from us and a sign from among the and and a

i spake to them them except what which you have ordered to me that which thou lord allah my lord
and i was a witness over them while i dwelt them but i was among them
and after my warning you and you became a witness to all
if you punish them they are your servants if you are them subjects and forgive them indeed you are the almighty the wise ”
allah will say ‘ this is the day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness ”
for them there shall be gardens with streams running in them to remain in them forever
allah is the the attainment and allah is the final success
to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them and he is able to do all things
praise praise to to allah who created the heavens and the earth and made appointed darkness and light
yet those who disbelieve ascribe rivals to their lord
it is he who created you from clay and then a term term is fixed for him a term appointed term
even you are are in doubt
and he is allah in the heavens and on the earth he knows your secrets and he overt you he knows what you earn
and never sign of the sign comes to them from the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of their lord but they turn away therefrom
they they denied the truth when it came to them but soon come to them the news of what they used to mock
have they not seen how many generations we destroyed before them
whatever is on earth earth earth you you and the earth
and we destroyed them for their sins and brought raised them to their generation and other generations
and we we sent down unto thee a book on paper which they touched touched touched it with their own hands but unbelievers would say this is naught but plain magic
and they say “ has not been sent down to him ”
had we sent down an angel the matter would have been settled and they would not be respited
and we we made him an angel we would have made him a a man man would have have made them a a man and then they are have been
and indeed were messengers ridiculed before you but those who mocked at the enveloped by the that they had been mocking
say travel the earth and observe how was the fate of those who have been

say “ i fear if i should disobey my lord the punishment of a tremendous day
from it is averted on that day he will have mercy on him that is the day that is the triumph
if allah touches you with adversity there is no remover of it except him
and if he touches you with good then he is capable of everything
he is the supreme over his servants and he is the allwise the aware
say “ what thing is greatest most most in
say allah is witness between me and you
and this qur an has been revealed to me that i may warn therewith you and whomsoever it may reach
do you indeed testify that there are other gods with god
say “ i do not bear witness that you is only for allah only one god is the from all that you ascribe as partners
those to whom we have given the book recognize it distinctly as they recognize their own sons those who are courted their own souls
and who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against allah or denies his signs
the the wrongdoers will not succeed
and on the day when we gather them all together we shall say to those who ascribed partners to allah where are now compeers partners whom you used to claim
then they will be no proving but to say by allah our lord we were not idolaters
see how they lie against themselves and how they what they they devised hath failed them
and among them are those who listen to you but we have covers over their hearts so they understand not in their their ears deafness in their ears
and if they see every sign they will not believe in it
until when they come to you arguing with you say say “ is nothing but the tales of the former peoples
they forbid others from it and and they keep away from it
but they ruin none themselves themselves and they do not
if you could see see when they are made to stand before the fire and say would say would that we could be sent back to the world and we shall be deny the of our lord and we will be among the believers
indeed what they concealed will appear to them
and were they to to they would return to what they had forbidden they would have been been liars
and they say there is no but our life of this world and we shall not be raised
if when they see when they are set before their lord behold will say “ this is not truth
they will say yea by our lord
he will say taste then the torment for having denied
they are certainly losers who deny the encounter with allah
when when the hour comes upon them they say “ alas for us that we neglected it ”
and evil is that which they bear
the life of this world is nothing but sport and play sport and a sport is the the abode of the hereafter is better better for those who fear
do you not understand
we know that they say distresses you
yet they they that that you is not that they that they are not
the the only the deny the verses of allah
messengers o you have been denied before and they were patient under the victory and they were patient until our help reached them
there can be no change the words of allah
news of the messengers has already reached you
and their aversion is a hard on you if you seek seek a tunnel the the earth or a ladder into the sky to bring them a sign sign or a ladder to them
and had allah willed he would have assembled them all together
only those who listen will respond to you
as for the dead allah will resurrect them then to him they will be returned
they say why has no portent been sent down upon him from his lord
say god allah has power to send down a miracle but most of them know not
there is no a creature on on earth no bird that flies with its wings but you are communities like you
we have nothing in the book
then they will be gathered before their lord
those who reject our revelations are deaf and dumb in darkness darkness
allah sends astray whom he wills and guides whom he will he puts him on a straight path
say thou should you if if the punishment of allah comes upon you or the hour arrives you you you other than allah if you are truthful
no it is alone alone you call and he will remove that if he wills he will he will he will
then you you forget partners you associate with him
we have sent sent messengers to to nations before you then we seized them with poverty and hardship and adversity and loss
if only they humbled when our punishment overtook them
but their hearts were hardened and satan made made all that they had doing used to do
so when they had been the they were reminded we opened for them the gates of everything until they rejoiced what they were reminded and we and we seized them suddenly and they were sore confounded
so the last of the people who did wrong were cut off
all praise be to god the lord of the worlds
say have you considered if allah should take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts hearts god god other than god will bring to to to you
look how we paraphrase the revelations yet they still turn away
say tell me considered if the punishment of allah comes to you suddenly or openly would be destroyed except the wrongdoing people
we do not send the messengers except as bearers of good tidings and warners
so those who believe and reform shall have no fear nor nor shall they grieve
but those who deny our messages will be seized them for their disobedience
say o muhammad saw i don t tell you that with me that i know the treasures of allah nor that i know the unseen nor say i am with you i am an angel
i only follow what is inspired to me
say ‘ are the blind and the seeing alike
will you not then consider
warn those who fear through it will be a day of their lord and they will not be intercessor other than apart from him
they may haply take heed for themselves
and do not drive away those who supplicate their lord morning and evening desiring his face
you are not accountable for them in any way nor are they accountable for you
if you drive them away you will become among the wrongdoers
thus similarly we have made some of them by means of others so that they may say ‘ these these whom god has favoured us us
is not allah know well those who are grateful
and those who believe in our revelations come to you say peace be peace you you
your lord has made mercy incumbent upon himself mercy of mercy and does not change his of ignorance and then repents and reforms himself and merciful
thus we we we plain our verses so that the way of the wicked may be distinct
say i i have i i i have to you you you say ‘ i am commanded to worship allah
if i i i would be lost and i be be of the rightly guided
say i i i have clear evidence from your lord
you do not prevent you from the the polytheists of you used to commit
the decision is for allah only
he relates the truth and he is the best of deciders
say if if what you were with which you would hasten the matter between me and you would have been settled and allah is the best of the wrongdoers
and with him are the keys of the ghaib and none knows them except him
and he knoweth what is in the land and the sea
not a leaf falls but he he knows it
not no grain is there is the earth nor a fresh and withered or withered but it is a clear record
and it is who gathereth you in night and knows what you what you by night
then he raises you up that it should be fulfilled for a term allotted
then to him is your return then he will inform you what what you have been doing
he is the omnipotent over his servants
he sends forth over you when death of messengers and you him and you you are him him
then they are restored to allah their lord allah will be their lord
all is the judgement and he is the swiftest of reckoners
say o muhammad who rescues you who rescues you in the from dangers the land and sea sea dangers and you call upon us if he if you are in the then we will be be of the thankful
say allah delivereth you from and from them from
then you still associate with him
say he is able to send punishment you from above you from above you or from beneath your feet or confound confuse you with hostile and make you taste the violence of one another
look how we paraphrase the signs variously so that they may understand
your people have denied it though it is the truth
say i am not a over you
every time is fixed for you a time and you will soon know
and you see those who gossip about our revelations of noah from them until they begin to talk of them until they perceive
and if satan should cause forget to sit after the wrongdoing people of the people who are not
those who are not are accountable accountable for them in the reminder for all that they may be careful
and leave those who take their religion as play and pastime and whom the life of the world beguiled
remind them hereby lest a soul soul doomed to what it has
it will not be to destruction or intercessor apart from allah will not caught for him
they are the ones who have given their evil deeds they have earned and have a painful punishment for what they have been and and a painful a painful punishment
say shall we call apart from god that which can neither benefit us nor harm us us us and we shall turn back on the heels after guidance has been guided us to wander perplexed on the earth confused although allah has guided us to the guidance to guidance
say indeed the guidance of allah is only guidance guidance and we have been commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds
and to establish prayer and fear him and it is to him that you will be gathered
it it is he who created the heavens and the earth in truth
on the day when he says be it will be
his saying is the reality
and his will be the dominion on the day when the trumpet will be blown
he is the secrets and declarations
he is the wise the expert
and when abraham said to his father azar do you take idols for gods
i i find you and your people in open error ”
and that we showed abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might be of those possessing
when night darkened over him he saw a star and said this is my lord
but when it set he said i love not those that disappear
then when he saw the moon rising he said this is my lord
but when it set he said if said had not not have had been me i would would have been among the erring people
then when he saw the sun rising he said this is my lord this is greater
but when it set he said o my people i am am quit of that you associate
i i have turned my face to him who created the heavens and the earth upright and i am not of the associaters
his people people said “ you with with me with me with me and has chosen me
i fear not fear that which associate with him unless my lord wills
nothing can happen to me except what my lord
my you not at all
and should i fear what you associate with him when you do not fear associating others with allah in his divinity that which he has not sent down to you
which then of the two parties has more right to security if you know
those who believe and obscure not tarnish belief with wrongdoing — there is security and they are rightly guided
and that was our conclusive we gave gave abraham against his his people
we raise whom we will in rank
your lord is wise allknowing
we we gave him of our grace
and we them them to the right
and noah guided noah previously and his descendants david and solomon and job and joseph and and and and aaron
thus do we reward the welldoers
and zakariya zachariya and yahya john and jesus and iliyas elias each one of them was the righteous
and ishmael and jonah and lot and the and of lut each one them them above the worlds
and of their ancestors and their descendants and their siblings — we chose them and we guided them to a straight path
that is the guidance of allah with it guides whomever he wishes of his servants
but if they had associated with him would have have all that they used to do
those are they ones whom we gave the book and understanding and prophethood
but if disbelieve disbelieve therein we have we entrusted it to a people who have not it
they are the ones whom allah has guided
say o muhammad ask of you no wage for it i am not a hire
it it is a reminder for the the worlds
they they not appraise allah with true appraisal when they said allah has not not reveal to any human being
say who muhammad saw who had sent the books moses moses which a light and a a cow which have
and you are in in in in in scrolls
then leave them to play around them gossip
and this is a blessed book which we have sent down confirming what was before it and that you may warn the mother of villages and the around it
those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they are watchful
and who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about allah or says i am not revealed to me who has has revealed no god has revealed by no god but he says says i like those who have revealed to allah
if you are see when the wrongdoers will be the throes of the angels will the souls of their lord will the souls of the angels will you will not the signs of this world and you will not be recompensed for the punishment of the you you you
and now you come to us as we we created you as we have created you you first first and you behind we we we you you we you as you you claimed as you you claimed to be your intercessors with you
now the the bond of you and from all you asserted has you you you you
it is is who splitteth the grain of corn and the datestone the datestone he bringeth forth the living from the dead and he is bringerforth of the dead from the living
such is god s of allah then allah is well aware of the
he is the cleaver of daybreak he has made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for calculation
such is the determination of the allmighty the allknowing
and it is he who has for you the stars that you darkness darkness by them in the darkness of land and sea
we have made plain our verses to a people who know
it is he who created created you from of the and made you
and god has has a parable of wide and place of place place of place place
we have detailed the the our signs for a who understand
it is he who sendeth down water from the sky and we we we bring forth the from the and and we bring forth the blade from the clusters of dates and the gardens of grapes and olive and the pomegranate like of unlike unlike
look at the fruits when they bear fruit and ripen
surely in are signs in this for people who believe
yet they ascribe partners to allah partners of allah though he had him in his divinity and he created them and impute falsely to him sons and daughters
exaltations to him and he is above what they describe
the originator of the heavens and the earth — how can he have a child when he had a child
and created all things and he has knowledge of all things
such is allah your lord
there is no god but he
and is the the creator the
so worship him alone he is the wakil trustee disposer of affairs guardian over all things
sights comprehend him not not him comprehendeth all sights
he is the subtle the expert
clear proofs have come come to you from your lord
so whoever shall see shall benefit to his own benefit and whoever does so to his own hurt
and say thou i am not a guardian over you
we thus we the the thee the truth that thou bringest the truth to our our ways and we may make our our revelations and we have our our revelations
those who disbelieve in the punishment for allah is more shameful punishment
follow what which is divinely revealed to you from your lord there is no god but him and turn away from idolaters
had allah willed they would not have associated
we have not made you a guardian nor them you are not a guardian over them
revile not revile those whom they invoke besides allah lest they begin to revile revile out of malice
we have made attractive every deeds of every nation seem fair to its
then to their lord is their return and he will inform them what what they used to do
they swear swear allah with their most earnest oaths that if a sign comes to them they would believe in it
say the signs are only with allah
and what would you you perceive when they sign would not believe
we will turn their hearts their hearts and their hearts away their hearts and they did not believe in it
even if we sent down the angels to the dead and the dead spoke to assembled them together the dead spoke to them and assembled them together
most of them behave in utter ignorance
we we have have have made as a human and jinn
they <unk> the the of of the <unk>
but if your lord had so willed they would not have done so so leave them alone
so leave them and what they invent
and it that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline thereto it and that they may be wellpleased and they may grow in they may grow in their
say i shall i seek seek as a judgement other than allah when it is he who has sent down the book the quran explained in detail
those to whom we gave the book know that it is the truth from your lord in truth
so be not thou o muhammad of the waverers
the word of your lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice
none is can change his words
he is the hearer the knower
if thou <unk> of the most of the earth would lead thee astray from the way of allah and they follow only surmise and conjecturing
your lord knows best who who goes astray from his path and knows best rightly guided
so eat of that over which allah s name ’ has been pronounced if you are in his signs
and why should you not eat of that over which allah name of allah has been pronounced while he has already made to you unless he has been forbidden you you are forbidden to you
and many many lead astray by their own inclinations without knowledge
your lord knows best the transgressors
and give both the open and hidden sin sin and those who earn sin will be recompensed for what they have earned
and eat not of that whereon the name of allah hath not been pronounced pronounced for the
the the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you
but if you obey them you will be be idolaters
is he who was dead we we quickened revived a light by the light by a who walk in him who is like one who is steeped in darkness manifold darkness
thus it is the disbelievers have made appear decorated to them
and thus we have placed in every town in its great ones to conspire in its wicked
they do not plot against against their own souls but they perceive not
and when a comes to them they say we will not believe until we are given the like of what was given to allah s messengers ’
allah knows best wheresoever to place his apostleship
soon will afflict the guilty and crimes with a severe punishment punishment of what they used to do
whomsoever does wants to guide he expands his breast to islam and he he he makes his breast tight as if he were climbing to heaven sky
thus allah allah those defilement upon those who believe not
this is the straight path of your lord
we have have made our signs in a people who take
for them is the home of peace with their lord
he will will be their protecting guardian for what they did
and allah will muster them o the the day of resurrection we have you have you company of those who have enticed you to misled us and and men have misled us from the knowledge of the and of the and and he will say “ our lord there
and will make the the the wrongdoers of the polytheists and they will they will be be
“ o my people of adam did not come to you from among you relating to you my signs and you you you you you you my signs
they will say “ we testify against ourselves ”
they will say we testify against ourselves
they will say by the life of the world and they will bear witness against themselves that they had been unbelievers
this is because your lord would not destroy townships unjustly while their people were unaware
and for everyone are ranks from his lord and have have have done
your lord is the rich of compassion
if he will he can remove you and and make succession to you in succeed you you as he produced you from the seed of another people
indeed that you are promised will come to pass and you can not frustrate allah
say o dear work you in your works and your works and working are working on the way of the whom ye will surely be presently to be lost the abode of the the
they assign a allah of whose tillage of cattle which we created and cattle and say this is for allah and say this is for allah and they assert and say this is our partners
but the share of their partners does not reach allah what they they will be partners
evil is their ordinance
and likewise the many of the the the children of slaying of their children to them to their killing of them to their religion and that they may have them to their partners to allah
if allah allah so willed they would not have done so
so leave them alone with their fabrications
they say these cattle and these crops are crops and cattle and they are are forbidden and one of them and whom their own contriving
and there are forbidden forbidden the cattle so forbidden for them cattle backs and backs and the cattle
they do not pronounce the name of allah which certain animals inventing lies against them
he will recompense them for their invented
and they say what is in the bellies of these animals is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our wives
but if it be stillborn they will share share him
he will recompense them for their attribution
he is wise and allknowing
they are those who kill their children from folly without knowledge and what has provided them by what allah has provided them by fabricating a lie
they have indeed gone astray and were not guided
it is he who produces gardens trellised and untrellised and the datepalm trees and crops of divers flavour like the like thereof and unlike unlike
so eat of its fruit when it fructifies and give the due on the day of harvesting and do not exceed the wasteful
and of the cattle he hath created for burden and some for small
eat of what allah has provided for you and do not follow footsteps footsteps satan
he he is to open enemy
eight pairs two of sheep two male male female and female female
say “ is it the two males he has forbidden or the two females or what the wombs of the two females
produce with sanction if you are truthful
“ and a pair pair camels a pair of oxen and two two females or or or the or the two females or that he has forbidden
or were you present when allah ordered this this
who is more wrong than one who invents a lie about a to mislead people astray than allah
god does not not the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
say i muhammad i not not that which revealed to me that is forbidden to me to eat from the except carrion outpoured blood and flesh of swine and that which is been hallowed or the hallowed be an abomination for the name of allah which allah hath been
but if someone is compelled to eat without being by his craving or reverting to your lord is is forgiving merciful
and forbade those who are jews we forbade every animal with undivided hoof and of oxen and sheep we forbade them with fat of what adheres to their backs or the entrails or what is mixed with bone bone
thus we we them for their rebelliousness and we speak speak the truth
so if they belie you say thou muhammad saw is of the mercy of your lord but his mercy and his wrath will be turned back from the guilty people
those who say “ if allah had willed we would not have ascribed partners to him nor would nor nor would we have forbidden anything
so had others before them likewise they tasted our punishment
say “ do you have any that that you can produce for us
in fact you nothing but conjectures and merely conjecturing
say to allah belongs the consummate argument
had he willed he would have guided you all
say produce your witnesses who may testify that allah has forbidden this ’
then if they testify have they follow follow follow the desires of those who follow our desires and those who deny our signs and do not believe in the hereafter and they equate others equals to their lord
say come you considered that he will kill your parents treatment from you and you kill kill parents and poverty and provide for you and you shall provide you with a
and do not approach immoralities what is apparent of them and what is concealed
and do not kill the soul which allah has forbidden to him except by legal right
haply you may understand that reason
do not approach the orphan s property except in the fairer manner until he reaches maturity
and observe fully the measure and and balance with justice
and when you speak be just even if it concerns a close relative
fulfill your covenant of allah
this he commandeth you that haply you will remember
this is my straight path straight so follow it straight follow you straight path
and do not follow the other paths lest they divert you away from his path
this is he ordained enjoined you so that you may be cautious
then we gave moses the book completing the complete the complete the complete the favours on the and as a and a and a mercy and a mercy to the a a a a a people might believe
and we we have sent down this book
follow it then be cautious you may be mercy
lest you should say the book was only only was revealed to us two sects we were not we were unaware of their study
or lest you say “ if only the book had been sent down to us we would have been better guided than they
so now has come to you a clear proof from your lord and a guidance and mercy
who then does more wrong than he who rejects the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah and turns away therefrom
we shall recompense those who turn away from our signs with a worst having turned away from punishment
do they not look for the angels to come to them or your lord should come or the or some your signs of your lord
on the day when some of your lord s signs ’ will not come no soul had anyone who had faith had not believed theretofore or earned good good
say we are waiting
as for those who divided their religion and became sects you sects you have nothing have have associated with in in in them
their affair is with allah and he will inform them of what they used to do
and whoever shall a good deed shall have tenfold him and and and shall be recompensed
and whoso bringeth a good deed shall have its deed shall be recompensed only its equivalent
say as for me my lord has guided me to a straight path a right religion the creed of abraham a monotheist he was not a polytheist ”
say my prayer and sacrifice sacrifice my life and my my my dying are all for allah lord of the worlds
no associate has he
and i am commanded and i am the first of those who surrender
say shall i seek someone other than allah lord when he is the lord of all things
and he is only that which earns
and whoever errs only errs against another
then to your lord shall be your return and he will inform you concerning that wherein you were at variance
it is he who has made you successors on the earth and made some of you above others in rank so that he may try you in what he has given you
indeed your lord is swift in retribution yet he is allforgiving allcompassionate
aliflaammeemsaad lam mim sad
this is a book revealed to you let there be no anxiety in your heart because of the believers
you are warn you all that you that you may be a reminder to the believers
follow what has been revealed to you from your lord and follow not masters other than him
little are you admonished
how many a township have have destroyed
our a raid by night or while they slept
and their cry when our punishment came to them only that they said indeed we were indeed wrongdoers ’
so we shall question those to whom the message was sent and we question question the messengers
then we shall surely to them with knowledge and we we were not absent
and the weighing of that day is true
so whose scales are heavy those are the prosperers
and those whose scales are light those are the who have lose themselves souls because they used to wrong our signs
we have established you on the earth and made for you in provisions for livelihood
little do you give thanks
we initiated created you then we gave you shape and we said to the angels prostrate before adam
so did not answer except those who prostrated not
allah said what prevented you from prostrating when i commanded you when i commanded you
iblis said i am better than him you created me from fire and him you created from clay
allah said o iblis get not down from it it is not be to go to go here
you will surely among the degraded
grant me respite till till the raising of the dead
allah said “ you are of those respite
he said because you have led me astray astray i will lurk in ambush for them on your straight path
then i will come upon them from before them and from their right and from their left and you will find most of them appreciative
allah said go contemptible and rejected
whoever of them follows you — i will surely fill hell with you all
and o adam you and your wife in paradise and eat from wherever you wish but approach this tree lest you will never transgress the evildoers transgress the sinners
then satan satan whispered suggestions to them to disclose to them their which was hidden from them their nakedness parts that said your lord has your lord willed you you become angels so that you become become of become a
and he swore by shaitan satan said i am a you sincere advisors
thus he he lead them by deception
and when they tasted of the tree their nakedness became became apparent to them and they began to stitch with the garden of the garden of the garden of paradise
and their lord called out to them saying did i not forbid you from that tree and tell you satan is an open enemy
they said “ our lord we have wronged ourselves
if you forgive us not have mercy on us we will surely be of the losers
allah said get the antagonist of the earth the earth the earth for for for the for fend for yourselves on the earth and for you
he said therein you shall live and therein you will die and from it you will be brought forth
o children of adam verily we have revealed unto you a garment your shame and your shame luxury
we have sent down of you a garment to cover it is shameful and feathers and the garment of allah
o children of adam let not satan tempt you as he drave your parents out of eden and he drave disrobe to their their garment with them
indeed he sees you he and his tribe from where you do not see them
we have made the devils allies of those who do not believe
and when they commit an indecent act they say we found found our fathers doing doing
say “ allah never enjoins any indecency
do you say regarding allah things you do not know
say my lord enjoineth justice
and pray to your lord and your justice and worship worship him
so call upon him and dedicate your your to him alone
just as he originated you so you will return
a group of them were guided and section of straying for they have taken instead devils instead of allah and they devils devils and they they they are guided
o children of adam take your adornment at every every of of and eat and drink and do not excessive
say who has forbidden the ornament of allah which he has brought forth for his servants and the good things of his providing
say these on the day of resurrection will be be exclusively for those who believed in the world life of the world
thus do we elaborate the signs for a who have knowledge
say “ my lord has forbidden immoralities indecent acts of what have forbidden forbidden and and and and and and and wrongful you associate with him in allah that you have no power over all things you have no knowledge
and every nation has term is when they can not put it off a single hour nor will they forward
o children of adam come to you from among you who narrate the from amongst you who you who have my and amend no fear shall not be them them nor shall they grieve
but those who deny our verses and are disdainful of them where shall be the of the fire they will abide therein eternally
who is more wrong than someone who invents lies about allah or denies his revelations
their is their portion of the book of when them when our messengers come to them them where now have say to them where they have forsaken besides allah they will say “ allah will say “ call upon us they will have abandoned us to will they they
he will say enter the fire of hell and humans who passed passed before you
every time that crowd enters it will curse its people will be
when they when they are all the first of them and say our our lord these will say “ our lord the first of punishment who will come to them so they will will be the punishment of the world
these misled us so give them a double torment of the fire
he saith for each one there is double torment but ye know not
then the preceding the the say say the the last of them have no wrong so taste taste the punishment for what you used to do
verily the who deny our signs and be opened for them who will not be opened for them nor shall they enter paradise until the camel of the needle
even so we recompense the sinners
for them is a bed of hell and over them coverings of fire
thus do we recompense the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and those who believe and do good works we we shall not soul capacity for of capacity capacity are they they are the garden they they shall abide
we shall remove whatever they have in their hearts
streams of running water them them will flow and their feet will say to praise praise thanks thanks to allah
we would have not been guided if we had not guided
the lord of our lord had come with the truth
and the call of paradise will be told ‘ this is paradise you have been for inherit for what you used to do
and the dwellers of paradise will cry unto the dwellers of our we found our our found our lord promised us to be the the
have you found found what your lord promised will be true
they will say “ yes “ shall be them “ the curse of god is the curse of allah ’
who debar men from the path of allah and would have crooked disbelieving in the hereafter they were disbelievers
and will be a veil between them and the heights will be men and the heights will be their mark and their mark they will call their mark and they will be their mark by their mark
they have not entered entered it but they are be to you
and when their eyes are turned towards the inmates of the fire they will say “ our lord do not place us among the wrongdoing lot ’
and the dwellers of the heights will call to men men men recognize by their features saying what your your numbers nor did you avail you you
are these the ones ones of whom you swore that allah would not extend them mercy of his mercy
“ o has been told to them enter paradise paradise no fear shall you grieve
the inmates of the fire will call out to the dwellers of paradise pour on us some water or or some of us
they will say allah has forbidden forbidden both to the disbelievers
who made their religion as a diversion and play and and and and and life of this world to come to them so that they forgot the meeting of this day they will be signs for a
certainly we have brought to you a book with a book with a and a a and a and a a people who have faith
do they look for the fulfilment of its fulfillment
on the day when the fulfilment thereof the forgetful who will say the apostles before the apostles of our lord had come the truth
or could we be returned to intercede for us so that we might return to us that we have have done do that we have have done
they have lost ruined their souls and what they used to invent has forsaken them
indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days then mounted the throne the throne the night a day and pursues it swiftly and the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by his command
lo his is the creation and commandment
blessed is allah the lord of all being
supplicate to your lord in humility and in secret
he does not love the aggressors
and do not corrupt the earth after its reformation and pray on him in the hope of allah and expectation
the the mercy of allah is close to the doers of good
it is he who sends the winds ahead of his mercy
then we have sent forth on the clouds we drive them a dead land and we water water we we down water to descend thereon therewith we bring forth kinds of splendid living thereof
thus bring we forth the dead
haply ye may remember
the vegetation of the good land its vegetation by the permission of its lord and the good of the that which is bad it is only from its vegetation
so we make plain the variously for the people who give thanks
we we sent sent nuh to his people
he said ‘ o my people worship allah
indeed i fear for you for punishment punishment of a tremendous day
the the of of abraham said “ we see you in in open error ”
he said “ o my people i am not a in my lord but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds ”
i convey unto you the messages of my lord and give sincere advice to you
and i know from allah what you know not
“ you you wonder that a reminder from your lord should come to you a from from yourselves from you so that your may warn you you and that you may be mercy
but they charged him a liar
so we delivered him and those who him in the ark and we drowned those who rejected our signs as false and drowned those who denied our signs
indeed they were a blind lot
and we hud we sent their brother hud he said o o my people worship allah you have no god other than him
the chiefs of his people said “ we consider you in foolishness and we think you are the liars liar
he said o my people there is no foolishness in me but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
i preach unto you the messages of my lord and i am a trustworthy adviser
do you wonder that a reminder from your lord should come to you from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you
remember remember that he made you successors after the people of noah and increased you in stature extensively
so remember the wondrous bounties of allah that you may be felicitous
they said have you come to us that we should serve allah alone and forsake what our fathers worshipped
then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful
he said “ punishment and wrath from your lord has befallen upon you
do you be me what what you have and your fathers have your your
you will never been sent with allah
then wait i am am with you with those who wait
then we delivered him and those with him by a mercy from us and we cut off the last remnant of those who rejected our revelations
and to thamood we sent their brother salih
serve allah you have no god other than him
there has come to you from from your lord
this shecamel of allah is a sign for you leave her alone for her in the s touch her not touch her with the another lest a painful punishment
and remember when he made you successors after successor the aad and lodged you in the earth you build palaces in its plains and hewed out dwellings in the mountains
so remember the wondrous bounties of allah and do not commit abuse on the earth spreading corruption
the the council of his people mockingly who were stiffnecked among those who were who believed believed you know that salih is a of of them that salih
they said “ we believe in what he has been sent with
those who were arrogant said “ we are in in that which you have been
then they hamstrung the shecamel and rebelled against the commandment of their lord and said bring salih bring bring down your threats if you threaten us if thou art of the of the
so the earthquake seized them and morning found them in their habitation
then he turned away from them and said o my people i have delivered to you the message of my lord and advised you sincerely but you do not you advisors
and lot when he said to his people commit do you commit such indecency as you have been preceded you before the worlds
lo ye come to desire instead of instead of women
nay but you are transgressed all bounds in sin
and his people was only to save from your city they said “ your lord
so we saved him and his family except his wife she she was of those who remained behind
and we rained down upon them a rain of stones
so see how was the end of the criminals polytheists sinners etc
and to the people of madyan we sent their brother shu ayb
serve allah you have no god other than him
a clear proof has come to you from your lord
so fulfill the weight and the balance and do not cheat the people of their goods and do not cause corruption in the earth after its restoration
that is better for you if you are believers
and do not lie in every path turning threats turning away from the path of allah those who believe in him seeking to make it crooked
and remember when you were few and he increased you numbers
consider see the end of the corrupters
and if there are a party of you who believeth in what wherewith i have been sent and believeth not party of believeth not believe in allah until allah judge between between us
he is the best of judges
the chiefs of the people who were arrogant said to his people will expel you shu aib who will who believe you you in our city land unless you return to our creed
he said “ we we hate it
if we return to your god your religion if we return it back again allah allah return to us it allah s ’ and we it it it is it from it
our lord embraces all things in his knowledge
in allah we have relied
judge with our our people for truth and thou are the best of those who judge
the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said “ if you follow shu aib you will be be be
so the earthquake seized them and morning found them in their ground
those who denied shu ayb became as though they had never dwelt there
those who denied shu ayb it was they who were the losers
so shu aib turned away from them and said “ my people i conveyed to you the message of my lord and warned you you you you
how can i grieve for a people who do not believe
we we sent no prophet to any prophet but that we seized its people with misery and adversity that they they entreat
then we changed evil ease for the good until they multiplied and prospered and multiplied and fathers
so we seized them suddenly while they did not
if the people of the towns had believed and feared allah would have opened opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth and the earth so we seized them with my lord
so we gave them them a a so that they they used to earn polytheism and crimes etc
do the people of the towns then feel feel secure from the coming of our punishment at night while they are asleep
or do the people of the towns feel secure from our punishment overtaking them at midday while they are playing
are they oblivious of allah s devising ’
none deemeth himself secure from allah s plan ’ except the people who are
is it not those who inherit the earth after its inhabitants of that we willed we would have them sins their sins and we seal upon their hearts so that they hear not
these towns — we whose accounts we recount to you to you
their there came to them their messengers with evidences but they were not not believe in that which they had denied before
thus does allah seal the hearts of the disbelievers
we found no loyalty to any covenant in most of them
nay we found most of them to to their
then we sent after them with moses with our signs to pharaoh and his establishment but they denounced them
look at the end of the corrupters
moses said pharaoh i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds
and behooves me to say nothing about nothing but the truth
i have brought a clear sign to you with clear sign from your lord so send the children of israel
he said if you have a sign then bring it a sign if you are truthful
so he threw his staff and behold it was a serpent serpent
then he drew out his hand and it was luminous to the beholders
the chiefs of the people of pharaoh awn said a clever magician
who wishes to expel you away from your land
what would you advise us
they said “ put him and his brother and send announcers to the cities to gather the people
to summon every every magician knowing
and the magicians came to pharaoh they said “ we have a reward if we are
he said yes and you will be among the near
they said moses wilt thou wilt cast thou the the or shall we be cast
he said ‘ you throw
and when they threw they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into the and and a mighty magic
we said moses moses moosa put moosa down your staff and it immediately began to pieces with their fabrications
thus the truth was proved and and what they were doing was to effect
thus they were vanquished they were turned back and look
and the magicians fell down prostrate
saying we believe in the lord of the worlds
the lord of moses and aaron
said said we we we we moses to moses moses with him in in in i i am you believe in that i may come to you from the lord of all things you have
but you shall know
i i will cut off your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides then i will crucify you all
they said verily we shall return to our lord
you you vindictive toward us only because we believed in the signs of our lord when they came to us
our lord give us sufficient endurance that we may increase the us
the chiefs of the people of fir awn said said his people leave moses and his people to spread disorder in the land and abandon you gods and leave and and leave and put us in in
he said we we will kill their sons and spare their women and we are indeed over them
said moses to his people seek help from allah and be patient
the earth is he he he he it it he he wills of his servants
the the sequel is for for the godfearing
they said we were persecuted before you came to us and after you have come to us
he said ‘ maybe your lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land and see how you will act
and we we punished the people of pharaoh with years of drought and scarcity of fruits that haply they might remember
but when good came to them they said this is our due to them and if misfortune befell them they ascribed to ill omen moses and those who him with him
indeed their evil was with allah but most of them do not know
and they said whatever sign you bringest to us to us to bewitch us we will not believe in you
so we sent loose them floods locusts and the vermin and the vermin and the frogs and the blood
they they were arrogant and they were a guilty lot
and when the punishment fell upon them they said o moses invoke your lord for us he he has for us to you
if you removest from us the wrath we will certainly believe you and we shall send the with you with the children of israel
but when we removed the punishment from them a a term which they must to reach they they broke their word
so we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea because they belied our signs proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
and we made the persecuted the eastern and western lands which the land and the blessed the blessed
and the fair word of of israel was fulfilled for the children of israel and he was a of the endurance
and we destroyed all his people and what they were and what they had harvested building
and we brought the children of israel across the sea
they said o moses
they said moses make for us a god as they have gods
he said verily you are a people ignorant
what the condition they are are destroyed in their perdition and destruction and all that they are doing
he said “ i seek for you a god other than god when he has exalted you superiority over all
and when when rescued you from the s people ’ who were visiting you with evil and slaughtering your sons and sparing your women and was your your lord might test your lord
we we appointed moses thirty nights and completed completed the more nights by the sinai and completed it with ten more
and moses said to aaron his brother take my successor among my people act and and follow people follow the way of the agents of corruption in the way of mischiefmakers
and when our came we his tryst and his him his his lord he cried to to me
he said “ lord lord me me me
he said not not you you me me
but it is no blame
if it stand still cease still then its place
and as his lord his lord unveiled his glory to the mount mount he it it down crushed the wind in the swoon
and when he recovered he said glory be to you
so i am to turn in repentance and i am am the foremost of those who who
allah said i have chosen you above you by all i my messages and my speaking to you
so take what i have given you and be among the grateful
and we wrote for him on the tablets the lesson for the details of all things and we details the details of the details of the details of the details of the best of virtue is best in conduct
i will turn away from my signs those who without arrogant in the earth without right and if they see the sign they will not believe in it
and if they see the way of consciousness they will not adopt it as a path so they will adopt it way of error they will adopt it way
this is because they rejected our signs and were heedless heedless
vain are the acts of those who deny our signs and the meeting in the hereafter
shall they be recompensed except according to what they used to do
in the absence of moses of moses adopted a image of a calf a image of a ornaments which lowed
did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way
they they took it for object of worship they were zalimun wrongdoers
and when they had afflicted their and they saw they they saw that they said if our lord have mercy on us and mercy on us we shall surely be of the losers
and when moses returned to his people angry and grieved he said what my absence after me that my absence
would you hasten on the judgment of your lord
and he cast down the tablets and he his brother by the head dragging him toward him
he said my mother s son that me me me me and almost killed me
do not let my enemies rejoice at me plight and do not put me among the wrongdoing people
he said “ my lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into your mercy for you are the most merciful of the merciful
verily those who took the calf for worship calf their calf their lord will overtake them in the life of this world and in the hereafter
thus do we recompense those who invent lies
but those who performed evil and later repent and believe and then lord is thereafter is forgiving merciful
when the anger abated in moses he took took the tablets
in their transcript is guidance and mercy for those who fear their lord
and moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment
when they arrived they were seized by a tremor
if you destroy us for hadst hadst hadst which which thou fools amongst us have been
“ is more but for something similar to do
so wish you you to you whom you will astray and whom will
you alone are our trial us us
you sendest whom you have and guidest whom you are the best of those whom you have
and for us in this world and in this world and in the hereafter there is visit upon us a mercy to whom we have provided with with whom i will and i mercy embraces all things and i will be those who mercy and those who believe in
those who follow the messenger the unlettered prophet whom they follow him ummi prophet described in the torah and the gospel and the gospel
he enjoins upon them and deters them and forbids them and he has committed of what is lawful for them and prohibits what is foul and prohibits them them and that is foul and
those who believe in him and help him and follow the light which has been sent down with him and those who are the successful
say o muhammad i am the messenger of allah to you all him him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
there is no god except he he gives life and causes death
he gives life and deals death
so believe in allah and his messenger the unlettered prophet who believes in allah and his words and follow him so that you may be guided
among the people of moses is a a party who guide by the truth and establish justice therewith
we divided them up twelve tribal communities and we revealed moses and strike each twelve rock with your staff and behold moses bring gushed forth twelve springs gushed forth from rock and your staff
then twelve springs gushed forth from twelve springs gushed forth from it
and we shaded them with clouds and sent down them manna and quails eat eat of the good things we have provided you
they did not wrong us but they were only wronging themselves
and when when time it was said unto them dwell in this township and eat from whence ye wish and and and and and and and and the gate prostrating and and we shall forgive you trespasses and we we shall forgive you trespasses and we shall increase of
but wicked did changed the other words to other than what they had been told
so we sent upon them a punishment from the sky for the wrong
ask them about the town by the sea when they violated the sabbath
when they observed the sabbath their fish would come to them abundantly
when they violated their sabbath their fish would come to them the the they had made known to them on the day of they had brought them
thus we tried them because they disobeyed
and when a community among them said why why do you admonish a people before whom allah will chastise them with a severe punishment
then when they forgot that they had been reminded we rescued those who forbade evil and we seized those who were with a severe punishment for their ungodliness
so when they exceeded the bounds of what they were forbidden we said to them be said be you spurned
and recall when announced your lord would send them for the day of resurrection he would inflict upon them a a terrible punishment
lo thy lord is ever the most
and he is the allforgiving the merciful
and we have broken them on earth earth separate groups groups some of them were righteous and those who are away from the earth
and we tried them with good and and calamities calamities perhaps they would be
and they were succeeded by a posterity inherited the book taking the life of this lower lower and forgiven
and if similar the way came to them they would would grab them
was not the covenant of the book taken from them but they would not say the truth and the studied it is the truth
and the home of the hereafter is better for those who are almuttaqun the pious see v 2 2
do you not understand
as for those hold fast to the book and establish prayer we shall not allow to be lost the reward of the righteous
and remember when we raised the mountain over them as if it was a canopy and it it was going to fall on them and would would have have been it
we said hold firmly to whatever we have given you the taurat torah and remember the taurat torah the injeel gospel they will remember the earth and the commandments be fearing allah
and when your lord took took from the children of israel saying i bring to the the of the having no to the the when they said to the the said to the the said to them the the lord said to them ‘ yes indeed we have not
or lest you say say our fathers our fathers associated with us and we we our fathers have been them and we were their offspring
will you you destroy us for the deeds of the vaindoers
and we distinguish the revelations that haply they may return
and recite to them the story of the to whom we gave our signs but he sloughed them off so satan followed him and he became of of the perverts
and if we we we we would we him him him his lust his desires to the earth and followed his own desires
so his is is that of a dog if you chase him it it let him alone it pants
such is the likeness of the people who deny our signs
recount to them the narratives in these men of old
evil is the example of the people who denied our signs and false and used to wrong
whomsoever god guides he is rightly guided and he whom he leads astray astray
we have destined for hell multitudes of jinn and humans
they have hearts with which they do not understand
they have eyes with which they do not
they have ears with which they do not hear
such are utterly neglectful
allah s are the fairest names
to allah belongs the finest names names so call them them them and abandon those who blaspheme his names and those who are impious impious
they will be recompensed for what they used to do
and of those whom we have created there is a community who guide by truth and establishes justice
and those who deny our signs we will not steadily lead them from where they will not know
and i respite them my stratagem is firm
do they not ponder that their companion is no madness from insanity
he is but a plain warner
have they not look at the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all things that allah created and that that that that their term is drawing near
so what discourse will they believe in after this
whomsoever allah sendeth astray there is no guide and he leaves them to wander perplexed in their rebellion
they ask you about the hour “ when is its determined
say the knowledge thereof is with my lord
he alone will soon save at
heavy is its burden burden the heavens and the earth
it will not overtake you except suddenly
they ask you as if you are eagerly
say the knowledge thereof is with allah but but most of men know not
say i have no power to benefit or benefit or harm to benefit except allah
and if i had the unseen i would have acquired much good would have no good
i am only a warner and a bearer of glad tidings to a who believe
it is he who created you from a single soul and made therefrom it mate that he might find comfort with her
and when he had covered her she conceived a light burden and and a about it
and when she is heavy they pray to their lord allah if you give us a good child we will surely be a
but when he gave given a good child they ascribed partners him him him in what they had given them
exalted is allah above having any partners that they ascribe to him
do they idolize that those who create nothing and are themselves created
and can not help them nor can they help themselves
and if you call them to guidance they follow you follow you
it is all same for you whether you call them or hold silent
indeed those whom you are the like of them are you are given them answer you call them answer you call upon them are you are are are truthful
have they feet wherewith they walk or have they hands wherewith they hold or have they eyes wherewith they see
or have they ears wherewith they hear your call and say o muhammad peace be upon me and then me and give me and respite me and respite me
my my protector is god who has sent down book book he he the befriends the righteous
and those whom you invoke besides him can not help you nor can they help themselves
if you call them to guidance they will not hear you
and you see them looking at you they can not see
o prophet enjoin forgiveness and enjoin what and turn away from the ignorant
and if a evil whisper comes to you satan satan satan then seek refuge in allah
he is allhearing allknowing
verily those who fear allah when instigation from satan satan troubles them and they clearly they they clearly
but their brothers they lead into error in error and then never stop short
and when you bringest not them a sign they say why hast thou not bring them a miracle they say
say i only follow only what is revealed to me from my lord
this is insights from your lord and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
so when the qur an is recited listen to it and pay silent so that you may receive mercy
and remember your lord within your heart beseechingly and and fear without being apparent in speech and and evening mornings and and evenings and do not be of the neglectful
those who are are your lord are not too proud to worship him
they exalt him and prostrate to him they prostrate
they ask you concerning the spoils of war
say the decision concerning bounties are allah and the messenger
so fear allah and amend the matters of difference among you and obey allah and his messenger if you are believers
the believers are only those who when allah is mentioned their hearts quake and when his verses are recited to them in increase their faith and and their trust in their lord they rely
who establish prayer and spend out of what we have provided them
such are are believers believers
for them are ranks with their lord and forgiveness and a generous provision
as your lord caused you out of your home from the home of the truth and disliked your reluctant to the believers and the party of the believers were averse to the truth and the lord it the truth and the lord it were a group among the believers
disputing with you about the truth after it had made clear as if they were being driven to death visible
and mention when allah promised you you one of you you would be yours and you should be yours that you should be yours
but allah intended to establish the truth by his words and to eliminate the disbelievers
that he might prove the truth and annul untrue and falsehood to even though the sinners may be averse
when you were calling to your lord for help answered answered i i am reinforcing you with a thousand angels
allah meant not as a as glad tidings and that your hearts may be assured thereby
and there is none but from allah
god is is allmighty allwise
when he made the slumber with a you as security and security from him and he sent down rain from from the sky and cleanse and remove from you from the sky and to you and to strengthen your hearts and to steady your feet
and when inspired the angels angels i am with you so support those who believe
so make firm those who believe stand firm
so i cast cast up with the necks of smite instil fear of private and strike the the of of them
that is because they opposed allah and his messenger
and whoever defies and disobeys allah and his messenger allah is is severe in punishment
that you you award this taste it and the is the punishment of the fire
o believers when you encounter the unbelievers marching to battle turn not turn your backs to them
and whoever turns his back on them on such a day unless swerving to strategy to battle and to join his company from him and his anger from him and his refuge is hell and destination
it was not you who killed them but it was allah who killed them
and it was not you who launched when you launched you launched
that he may bestow upon the believers believers
and is allhearing allknowing
that is the case and know that allah is the unbelievers of
if you desire a verdict a judgement has come to you a form of the and
if if you desist it will be better for you
we we will give you
if you will avail you avail you however numerous will not be however the disbelievers will avail you against allah
o believers obey allah and his messenger and do not turn away from him when you hear him speak
and do not be like those who say we have heard but do not hear
indeed the worst of beasts in allah s sight are are deaf and dumb who do not understand
had allah known any good in them he would have made them hear
and even he had them them hear they would turn away
o you who believe respond to the messenger and allah calls to you that which gives you life and preservation
know that allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that tohim you will be gathered
and fear a fitnah affliction is not not smite the the of you particular particular the evildoers that you are wrong in the punishment of allah that is severe in punishment
when when you were few in the land and deemed you were deemed in the land and you not in in
then allah made you you you you and you you you you you you that you may give grateful
o you who have not not betray allah and the messenger nor betray your trusts while you know
know know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that with allah is a mighty reward
o you who believe fear you and criteria criteria criteria criteria and give you a criteria and cleanse you and will forgive you
allah is is owner of bounty
and recall when those who disbelieved plotted against you captive captive or you captive or you captive
they planned and allah planned but allah is the best of planners
and when our revelations are recited to them they say we have heard
we could wanted we could compose the like of this they are nothing but fables of the men of old
and they said said if allah if this be truth from you then rain down stones us stones from us or bring us a a painful punishment
but allah would not punish them while you are amongst them midst nor afflict them and they seek to make them a painful punishment
what plea have they not that allah should not punish them when they debar them from almasjid al haram and they not not the guardians of the mosque
its only its are the cautious but most of them know not know
their prayer at the house is nothing but whistling and clapping
therefore taste the punishment for what you used to defy
those who disbelieve spend their wealth to bar from from the way of allah
they will spend it then it will become a source of anguish for them and they will be be grateful
and those who disbelieve will be gathered for hell
that order that allah may distinguish the wicked from the good and link the wicked together and cast them into the heap and and them
these are verily the people who lose
say to those who disbelieve if they cease their belligerence before them what they past will be forgiven them
but if they resume the hostilities then the precedent of the predecessors already taken away
and fight them until there is no fitnah and religion is is for allah
if they desist allah allah watches what they do
but if they turn away then know that allah is your protector an excellent helper
and know that whatever you you obtain as booty of the fifth of the messenger of allah and the messenger and the orphans and orphans and the poor and to the wayfarer if you have believed in allah and the day of victory the day we sent down to
and allah is over all things
and recall what time you were hither hither hither hither hither the the caravan side of the caravan below you
and if you had mutually appointed you would have have failed you appointment
if you have a mutual appointment to have failed failed failed you have have failed with which would have declined to to perish
and verily allah is allhearer allknower
and when allah showed them to you in your dream as few in number and would have have lost you and would have have been you
but allah saved he knows the inner thoughts thoughts in the chests
and when he made made them appear you few your eyes when you met few in their eyes and he made you appear as a state of that
and to allah are all matters returned
o you who have believed you a host firm and stand firm and remember allah much that you may be successful
and allah and obey and his messenger
do you not your your and do not lest you become a <unk>
verily allah is with the patient
and do not be like those who left their homes boastfully showing off to to the people barring barring from from the way of allah
allah encompasses all they do
and when satan made their deeds seem decorous to them and said “ shall overcome you today you will overcome you today
but when the two armies sighted each other he he ran away and fled saying i i am quit of you
i fear allah and allah is severe in punishment
the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is sickness said to those religion religion said to those deceived
but whoever puts his trust in allah then verily allah is allmighty allwise
and if you could see when the angels take away the souls of the striking their striking their faces and their backs saying taste the punishment of the burning
this is for your for which your hands wrought
and is not not unjust to the least to his creatures
like is they of the wo nt of the house of fir awn and those before them
they disbelieved in the signs of allah wherefore allah laid hold of them for their sins
verily allah is strong severe in retribution
that is because allah would never change his favor to him when he has given a people until they change what is made
and verily allah is allhearer allknower
their case is like that of the people of pharaoh and those before them before them of the signs of their lord and we destroyed them for their sins and pharaoh and drown the people of the fire
and we drowned the folk of pharaoh
and all of them were wrongdoers
indeed the worst of beasts in allah s sight are those who have not faith will not believe
those of them with whom you made a treaty and they break their agreement every time
so if you them them them in in them in a fearsome disperse for them so that they may take heed
and if you fear treachery from any people break covenant to do not make them in them terms
allah does not love the treacherous
and never think that they may suppose that they can not defeat they can not frustrate allah
make ready for them whatever force can strings of horses and can muster that you may overawe the enemy of allah and and enemy and others besides them whom you may know not allah knows them
and whatever you spend in the way of allah shall be repaid repaid to you and you will not be wronged
but if they incline to peace incline incline incline to it and put your trust in allah
lo he is the hearer the knower
and if they intend to deceive you allah is sufficient for you
he it is who supporteth thee with his help and with the believers
and brought their hearts together
hadst thou expended all that is in the earth you couldst not have united their hearts but allah united them verily he is allmighty allwise
0 prophet sufficient for you and those follows the believers follow the believers follow you
o herald of the hidden
if two of you twenty who you they will overcome two hundred and if they are they shall overcome
this is a a a believers
allah has now lightened your for for you he knows there is weakness in you
so if there are a hundred of you they they shall overcome two hundred and if there be a thousand they shall overcome two thousand of the they shall defeat the defeat the
allah is with the steadfast
it is not for a prophet to take prisoners in order to have prisoners in the land
you merely the materials of this world but allah desires for you the hereafter
god is is allmighty allwise
had there not a a predetermined decree from allah a awful had would have afflicted you a great mighty punishment
now enjoy what you have won as lawful and good and and good
and fear allah allah allah is allforgiving allmerciful
o prophet tell them if you have your hands hands finds allah finds any good in your hearts he will give you better than what has been taken from you and he will forgive you
and allah is forgiving merciful
but if they intend to betray you they have already betrayed allah before
so he gave you prevail over them
god is allknowing and wise
those who have and migrated and strove and fought and their wealth in the cause of allah and those who gave them and and those who are and and allies of them
as who have believed and emigrated and have not emigrated for them them them them them but them but but but allah has them them them
and if they seek your help you you you religion religion religion is incumbent against you against them a treaty and help help you a help
allah observes all that you do
as for the unbelievers they are friends one of another
unless you do do this will there there land strife in the land and great corruption
those who have faith and migrated and strove and and fought and the cause of allah and those who gave them and helped them are they are the believers
for them there forgiveness and a noble provision
and those who believed afterwards and emigrated and strove along with you they are you you are
but those related blood relationship are nearer entitled to inheritance in the decree of allah
allah has knowledge of all things
this is a declaration of disassociation by allah and his messenger to those polytheists whom you have made treaty
and travel not in the land for four months and know that that allah will not cause failure to allah and know that allah will not cause failure to allah
and will the the the harmdoers
and a proclamation from allah and his messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that is the the the idolaters his messenger
so if you repent it will be better for you but if you turn away then know that you will not escape
and give thou to muhammad saw a painful torment
except those idolaters with whom you have made a treaty and who have not abated you nor nor supported anyone against you
so fulfill the treaty with them to the end of its term
indeed allah loves the righteous
then when the sacred months expire kill slay the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and lie in wait for them at every ambush
but if they repent and establish prayer and give the poorrate leave them go go go to waste
god is forgiving and merciful
if if any of asylum asylum of asylum grant him asylum that he may hear the word of allah
then escort him to a place of safety for they do not know
how can there be a treaty with allah and with his messenger with the polytheists associate with him with those whom you covenanted near at the sacred mosque
so long as they are true to you be upright with them
indeed allah loves the righteous
how can there be any they you they respect of you they respect neither kinship nor agreement
they please you with their mouths but their hearts are rejection and most of them are disobedient
they have bartered the revelations of allah for a small gain and and debar men from his path
evil indeed is what they have done
they they toward the believer they respect of kinship
such is they who are the transgressors
but if repent and establish prayer and give the poordue they are your religion
we we we expound the revelations for a who know
and if they fight they they are their arms and fight them their their religion then fight the leaders of their leaders
so have no no
will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and purposed to expel the messenger and the hostilities hostilities hostilities against you against you against you
you would have been faithful right be wary of allah if you are believers
fight them allah will punish them at your hands and humiliate them and will them victory over them and heal the breasts of the believing people
and remove the fury in the hearts
and allah turns relent toward whomsoever he liketh and allah is knowing wise
do you think that you will be left alone by allah has not yet tested those who have and fought and strove hard in his cause and his messenger and the believers
allah is aware of what you do
it is not for the polytheists to tend allah s sanctuaries bearing witness to tend mosques testimony
those works have failed and in their vain fire they will bide they shall abide
only those who believe the the of allah who believe in allah and the last day and establish prayer and give the poorrate and do not right and whosoever is right and will not be of them nor shall they be of the
do you consider the providing of water for the pilgrim the maintenance of almasjid alharam mosque as the same worth to the worth in allah and the last day and strive in the cause of allah
they are not equal in the sight of allah
and allah not not the the wrongdoing people
those who have believed and migrated and fought and have striven in the way of allah with their wealth and their lives in the s pleasure in the s of allah and they are the triumphant
their lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from him and acceptance goodwill of and gardens wherein rivers will be the delight
they will abide in it forever ever with a mighty reward
o believers who believe do not take your fathers and your brothers your brothers for your friends if they prefer disbelief befriends you befriends them – then they are the unjust
say if if your fathers your sons your brothers your wives and your wives and you you have acquired and have acquired and have acquired the business you you dwellings you dwellings you dwellings you are dearer to you than allah and his messenger and struggling in his way
allah does not guide the evildoing folk
allah allah helped you on many a battlefield
in the battle of hunain when your numbers availed you nothing availed you nothing earth and it availed you naught and the earth
then allah sent down his composure upon his messenger and upon the believers and sent down hosts you did not see and punished the disbelievers and the the the the the faithless
then after that allah will accept the whomever whomever he wills
and is is forgiving merciful
o you who have believed idolaters the polytheists the unclean so do not approach them in the sacred mosque and the year
if you fear poverty allah will enrich you from bounty
god is allknowing and wise
fight those who do not believe in god and the last day and forbid what god has forbidden his messenger and the forbidden and the religion and the who do not the religion of until they pay the tribute out of hand
the jews said ezra ezra is the son of allah and the the christians say the is the son of allah
that is their saying their their mouth resembling the sayings of those who disbelieved before
may allah assail them where are they deluded
they have taken their rabbis and their monks as lords besides allah and and and and and and and and they were not worship allah allah allah and allah and allah is no allah except him they ascribe as partners partners that allah him
they wish to extinguish the light of allah with uttering blasphemies but allah refuses but to perfect his light however the unbelievers will perfect his light however the unbelievers get averse
it is he who sent his messenger with the guidance and the true religion that he may make it prevail over all religion however the idolaters may be averse
o believers who believe the rabbis and monks monks who devour monks unjustly devour the wealth of the people of vanity avert from the way of allah
those who hoard gold gold and silver and spend not in it cause of allah announce them of a painful punishment
on the day when they will be heated in the fire and therewith branded their foreheads and their flanks and their backs and and it will be branded with them and told what you hoarded for what you hoarded hoarded for this is what you hoarded for for yourselves
taste then that which you have treasuring
the number of the months with allah is twelve in the book of allah the day that he created the heavens and the earth
that is the right religion
and fight not yourselves against all together and they fight against you all together and fight against you all together and know that allah is with the godfearing
the the postponing of restriction sacred months is is is the disbelief the unbelievers
they allow to be another for another for one another that which is in allah and forbidden to allah
the evil of their deeds seems pleasing to them
their evil seem fair to them as decorous and allah does not guide the unbelievers
o is happened that you that when you said to you march in the way of allah you linger with heaviness in the ground
are you content this life life rather than the life
the the of of the life of this world in comparison with the hereafter
if you you not march forth he will afflict you with a painful punishment and you will replace you with another people and you will not harm him at all
and allah is over all things
if you do not help the help allah allah help him when he had helped the first first
when the two was due was said to him “ do not see the the of god is with us and his companion when you were with him and the shechina on the legions of the angels was with you the word of the the the of the and
most exalted is the wise
go forth whether armed or or heavily and wealthy with your possessions and your lives
that is better for you if you know
had the gain been immediate and the journey they would have followed followed you but the distance seemed too to them
still they will swear by allah if we we would have marched forth with you
they damn their souls souls and allah knoweth that they are liars
may god forgive you
why did you grant them leave until it was to those who spoke to you the truth and you were liars
those who believe in allah and the last day will not ask leave of leave in their homes and their lives and their lives
allah fully knows the godfearing
it is only those who believe not believe in allah and the last day and whose hearts are doubt so they waver in their doubt
and if they had to go forth they would have made preparations for it but god was averse to their wending so he held them back to lag behind ”
had they gone forth with you they would have have added to you trouble and they would have hurried to you fro in your midst seeking to cause you to among you would have have some of you are listened to you
and allah is allaware of the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
they they sought to cause sedition earlier stir up sedition and the truth until the truth came the truth and the truth prevailed and they were averse
among them some are some that they give us to do not expose me to temptation they they succumbed succumbed succumbed to temptation
and indeed hell will engulf the disbelievers
if good befalls you it dislike it upsets them but if a calamity overtakes you they say we took precaution and advance in advance in advance
say ‘ nothing will befall us except what allah has ordained for us
he is our maula lord helper
in allah let the believers put their trust
say do you await for us except one of the two things or or with us for that allah will afflict afflict you with a punishment from allah or at our hands
so wait we are are with you
say spend spend willingly or unwillingly it will not be accepted from you you are a a a a a
and naught preventeth that from that which hath not in the and that they disbelieved in allah and his apostle and they do not come to prayer save lazily and spend not spend
so let not their their children impress you o muhammad to them desires desires to punish them in in the life of this world and in the world to come they would be among the unbelievers
they swear by allah that they are with you they they are not
they are not a frightened lot
if they find a a shelter or a or a place to creep into they would turn to it
and are some of them who accuse you in the matter of the
if they are given thereof they are content and if they are not given thereof they they are enraged
would would have been content with what allah and his messenger and and his messenger and say allah will give us allah will give us us bounty and his largesse
we to allah we are eagerly turn away
the alms are only for the poor and the the and the needy and those employed to collect the whose hearts is hearts and those who are the debt and the and the traveler and allah is the allah and the stranded traveler and allah is the allah and
god is allknowing and wise
and among them are those who abuse the prophet and say ‘ ‘ is ear
say he is a good for you in believes in allah and believes in the and and a mercy for those of you who believe
for those who believe believed the oneness of allah islamic monotheism and do good deeds
a painful chastisement lies in store for those who have a messenger messenger muhammad saw those who have the of allah
they swear by allah to you but you are but to please you but if they are worthier they please please allah and his messenger believers
do they not know that whoever opposes allah and his messenger will enter the fire of hell to abide therein eternally
that is the supreme disgrace
the hypocrites are lest lest surah should be revealed about them what is in their hearts
say mock mock as much as allah what allah which expose what you dread
if if you them they will say we were only gossiping and we and and amusing ourselves
say ‘ were you deriding allah and his signs and his messenger ”
do not make excuses
you have disbelieved after your faith
if we pardon some of you we will punish others because they they were guilty
the hypocrites both men and women are are one of them
they enjoin what is evil and forbid what is good and forbid their hands from spending spending in the way cause
they forsook allah so allah forsook them
the hypocrites are the sinners
allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of hell abiding therein forever
it is their due
allah curseth cursed them and them condemnation and a lasting punishment awaits them
like those before you you
they were more than than you in wealth and children children more more
they enjoyed their share awhile so you enjoyed their portion in this world and enjoyed their share in the
such are they whose deeds are in vain in this world and in the hereafter
such are they who are the losers
have there not heard of the the of the of noah the aad and thamood and the people of noah and aad and the people of midian and the midian and the disasters were overturned
their messengers came to them with with evidences
so allah was not allah but they harmed themselves
the believers both men and women are allies of one another
they are the virtuous will be the the charity and those who believe in allah and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the allah and allah is the true
god allah is allmighty allwise
allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow
goodly mansions in the gardens of eden and the is the greatest pleasure of allah
that is the supreme achievement
o prophet struggle with the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh with them with their abode is hell and an evil destination
they swear by allah that they said not not
but they did utter the word of unfaith unfaith and renounced faith
and they plotted not resentful only for allah and his apostle and enriched them out his bounty
if they repent it will will be better for them but if they turn away from god will sternly punish them with a painful punishment
none they shall be no on earth nor protect or help them
and of them are made a covenant with allah if he gives us give us his bounty we will give alms and give sadaqah zakat and voluntary charity and will righteous righteous
but when he gave them out of his bounty they became niggardly refused to it
so he caused hypocrisy with hypocrisy hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they meet him because they broke their promise to allah because they broke their promise to allah and because they lied
do they not know that allah knows their secret and and their secret and that god is the knower of things hidden
those who defame the voluntary who give alms and and those who give alms and they give their their their to give their their their ridicule and them will will them them will will them them them them
ask forgiveness for them or ask forgiveness for them them if you seek them forgiveness for them seventy times allah will not forgive them allah will not forgive them because of their ungodly
those who were left behind rejoiced at the staying behind the messenger of allah and hated to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of allah and their belongings and their lives in their heat
say the fire of hell is more intense in heat if they but understand
so let them laugh a little and weep they will be recompensed for for what they used to earn
if allah brings you back to the battlefront to a group of them they shall ask you leave to leave go with me say you will not go forth with me nor fight will not fight with me
you were wellpleased to remain at home so now first time so sit now with those who remain
and never pray pray over any of them when he dies nor stand at his graveside
they they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and died while they were defiantly
and let not their surprised their their children children of allah and their children and that they will not hurt them in the world and the the hereafter life
and a surah is revealed down they believe in allah and strive with his messenger to fight fight with us and his leave us with those who leave us say leave us to make a steadfast
they are satisfied to be with those who stay behind and their hearts are sealed so they do not understand
but the messenger and those who have embraced with him and have struggled with him and and lives is the and his is the the the the
allah has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow in to them shall live for ever
that is the supreme achievement
and the bedouin arabs came with excuses seeking leave to stay behind
thus those who had false and and his messenger sat at home
a painful punishment shall afflict those among them who disbelieved
there is no blame on the weak nor on the sick nor on those who spend in the cause of allah and his messenger
not for the virtuous is there way of the muhsinun gooddoers the footnote of v 9 120
and is is forgiving merciful
nor is those who when they came to you to you you mounts to mount you you you you mounts to mount you turned away back to back to back to back to tears grieved overflowing with tears of that they they not find
the ground of complaint is only against those who ask thee to leave and stay behind
they are satisfied to be with those who stay behind
they will make you to you when you return returned
say them make no excuses we will not believe you
allah has already told us of your news
and allah his messenger will see your work then will will be returned back the knower of the sensible and the visible and he will inform you of what you used to do
they will swear by allah by allah when you return to them that you may leave them alone
so leave them alone
so leave them and their they they are a abomination for their resort
they will plead to you that you may be reconciled
but if you accept them allah allah will not be pleased with the transgressing disobedient
the bedouin arabs surpass more in unbelief and hypocrisy and more likely to be more likely to know that limits in allah allah has revealed to his messenger
god is allknowing and wise
and among the bedouin arabs there are some in regard what they spend as a fine and and a fine and wait for wait for you
upon ill fortune befall them fortune
and is allhearing allknowing
and among the bedouin arabs are those who believe in allah and the last day and taketh their wealth as approaches to them as a of of allah and the messenger
lo it is an acceptable means of nearness for them
allah will bring them into his mercy
god is forgiving and merciful
and the first of embrace islam and the muhajirun and those who followed them and the ansar and citizens who almadinah who almadinah who almadinah who migrated in the way of allah and it it it with him who are the
he has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow where they will live for ever
that is the supreme achievement
among the desertarabs around you there are some who are some of the and the the
you do not know them but we know them
you o muhammad saw not know them we know them
we will punish them twice then they will be returned to a severe punishment
and have confessed their confessed their sins they have mixed a righteous deeds deeds with another
perhaps allah will redeem them
god is forgiving and merciful
take them from their wealth their wealth in order to purify them and and them them and hears and them them them them them them is allhearing allknowing
do they not know that it is allah who accepts repentance from his servants and receives charities and that it is he who is the and the merciful
and say to them act as to will be
and allah will his and his his messenger and the believers
then you will be returned back to the knower of the unseen and the seen you all that you have inform you of what you used to do
there are still some others whose affairs await the dispensation of god
he will either punish them or turn towards them
god is allknowing and wise
and as for those who have a mosque to mosque and hurting a blaspheming and the believers and the and of ambush for the believers and and the outset allah and his messenger aforetime and they swear by allah and allah testifieth that they are liars liars
do not stand in it ever
a mosque founded on piety from the first day is worthier of your visiting it
within it are men who love to purify themselves and allah loves those who purify themselves
then is he who who his building on godwariness and fear god and his pleasure better or he who founds his building on brink of a crumbling bank so that it crumbles down with him into the fire of hell
and allah not not the the wrongdoing people
the buildings they have built will always cease to their their hearts unless their hearts are torn into pieces
god is allknowing and wise
indeed allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties for the price of paradise paradise they they in paradise and they fight in the way of allah and kill the and kill and the slain
it is a promise incumbent on him in the torah and the gospel and the qur an
who fulfilleth his covenant better than allah
that is the supreme achievement
those who constantly who who who constantly repentant and those who travelers travelers and who travelers and who who who who and who who forbid dishonor and and who enjoin the and who observe the limits of those who who wrong and and the and the who forbid the
and give good tidings to the believers
it is not for the prophet and those who believe to ask forgiveness for forgiveness idolaters even though they be near relatives after it has become clear to them that they are the
and abraham for his forgiveness forgiveness of his father was only for fulfill fulfill a promise he had made to him
but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of allah he disowned him
abraham abraham was longsuffering plaintive and forbearing
and allah would lead a people astray after he has guided them until he makes clear to them what they should avoid
lo allah is aware of all things
to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
he it is who gives life and death
and besides allah you have neither any wali protector or guardian nor any helper
allah has forgiven the prophet and the muhajireen and the ansar who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a party of them were inclined to them hearts some of them
indeed he is to them compassionate
and he relented towards the three who were left behind
the the of the <unk> of its <unk> it is no defender against them
then he turned to them in repentance so that they repent
allah is the relenting the merciful
o ye who believe be with with and be with those who are truthful
and is not their example in the world of medinah and to the people of the people prefer prefer the to the the thirst to the thirst or the thirst or the thirst nor did they tread to the the way of allah it it is not to the
allah does not waste the reward of the good
nor do they spend any sum small or or small or cross valley but it is written to their credit that allah may reward them them according to the best of what they used to do
and it is not for the believers to fight all together
of there should a people a group of leave of that they leave that they may gain understanding that they may gain their religion and that they they may warn them when they return to them that they may beware
o believers fight the unbelievers who are near to you and let them realise you are are returned to allah allah
and whenever a surah is revealed there are some of them say say which of you has this increased in faith
as for those who believe it has increased them in faith and they rejoice
but as for those in whose hearts is disease it only addeth to and and to die pollution and they die while they are disbelievers
do they not see that they are tested once or twice every year once they are not they do not repent
and whenever a surah is sent down they look at one another as they look at one another saying they slip away
allah has turned their hearts because they are a people who do not understand
verily there has come unto you a messenger muhammad saw from amongst yourselves ie whom you know well
he grieves you that that has come to you should be grieve for grieve is anxious over you and that he is is to be faithful
so if they turn away backs say allah is sufficient for me
there is no god save him
in him i have put my trust and he is the lord of the tremendous throne
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the wise book
is it a wonder to the people that we have a man from among them warn those who have faith in their lord and the believers are in heedlessness that is a the footing with their lord in the unbelievers say this is a an say magician this is
your your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established himself on the throne really all manner
there is no intercessor except by his permission
that is allah your lord
so worship him
will you not remember
to him will be return return together together allah will know
it is he who originates creation then will repeat it that he may reward those who believe and do good deeds
but those who disbelieve will have a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment because what they used to defy
it is he who made the sun a shining light and the moon a light and measured the stations of stages that you might know the number of years years and the reckoning
allah did not create all that except with justice
he explains his ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc in detail for people who understand
in the alternation of the and day and in that allah has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear allah
surely those who do not expect to meet us and are gratified with the life of this world and content with it and those who are heedless of our signs
their their refuge is the fire for what they have been earning
surely those who believe and do good deeds their lord will them by his lord will guide them to gardens beneath them rivers flow
their cry therein it “ o purity “ to be peace and to you will be their greetings and the conclusion of their prayer is the conclusion and allah is the lord of all praise ’
if allah were hasten to for mankind to the evil of their term would hasten the good for them would have been
but we leave those who do not expect to meet us in their wandering blindly
and when affliction touches man he calls upon us lying on his side or sitting or standing but if he remove his his affliction from him as if he had never called him in his his
in fact they have been made attractive to to the prodigals
how many generations have we destroyed before you when they did wilfully unjust to their messengers came to them with clear proofs and they would not believe
so we punished the sinful people
then we appointed you successors on earth after them in the land we might see how you would be
and when our clear revelations are recited to them those who do not expect to meet us say “ this is a a a or a
say it is not not me to alter it change it of my accord
i only follow what is revealed to me
if i disobey my lord i fear the punishment of an awesome day
say had allah pleased i would not have recited it to you nor would he would not have made you to you
i i have stayed a you life before you that was among whole lifetime before it
have you then understand
who does greater wrong than someone who fabricates lies about allah or denies his revelations
surely the guilty will not prosper
they worship worship beside allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth them power and say say these are our intercessors with allah
say are you you informing what about what he knows not in the heavens or on earth
hallowed be he and exalted above above having any partners that they they with him
mankind was a single community then they differed
then then went with with the
had it not a word word proclaimed from your lord it would have been between them in respect of that which they differ
they say why has a sign not been sent down upon him from his lord
tell them the the the unseen belongs to allah
wait then i shall with you along with you
when we let mankind taste our mercy after some adversity hath touched them behold they they scheme against our revelations
say allah is more swift in scheming
indeed our messengers write down that which you plot
it is he who enables you to journey through the land and the sea
when you are the ships ships sail with them and they sail with with them and they sail with them and they dash them them they they they supplicate to us and and and and and they are we and we and we and we are the grateful
nevertheless when he has delivered them behold they rebel insolent in the earth wrongfully
your rebellion are only against your own souls
the joys lies is ephemeral you and to us is shall be returned
the parable of the world is like the rain of the earth which we send down from the sky and the plants of the earth eat of the and of the cattle eat of the the cattle and that the luxuriantly
but when the earth puts on its and on adorned it and beautified beautified it and it it mastered night or by night or we we it it to the day day and we were not it as a mown field
thus do we elaborate the signs for a who reflect
and allah calleth to the abode of peace and guideth whomso ever he will to a straight path
for them who have good is good and is surplus
neither dust nor abasement shall cover their faces
they are the inhabitants of paradise they will abide therein
as for those who have earned evil deeds the recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent and humiliation will be cover them when they will cover them
no defender will they from from allah
they will be as if their faces were covered with dark patches of night
they are the people of the fire they will abide therein
on the day when we shall muster them all together we say to those who ascribed partners to partners in allah and you partners partners you will say to you partners ‘ you will your partners partners ” and your partners ”
allah is allah as witness between us and you you were not aware of of us
there every soul will prove what it has earned and they will be restored to them and they they they returned to their their master and they will be recompensed for their deeds
say who provides for the the heaven and the earth or who controls the and and the sight and who brings the dead from the sky and the dead from the living and the dead from the living and directs the affair
such then is allah your true lord
so what is there after truth but error
then where are you being led away
thus the the word of your lord is realized against them that they do not believe
say them is there any of your partners who originates creation then brings about it
say allah produceth creation then reproduceth it
how where do you deluded away
say is there of your partners whom you ascribe to to the truth
say it allah guides to the truth
then he who guides to the truth worthier to be followed or he who guides not unless unless himself
what is the matter with you how do you judge
most of them just follow conjectures and conjecture is no no avail to the truth
allah is the aware of what they do
this koran could not have been forged by any it
it is a confirmation of what revelation which preceded it before the detailed exposition of the book
there is no doubt about it — it is the the lord of the universe
do they say he has fabricated it
say then produce a sura like it and call upon call upon apart from god if you are truthful
in fact they deny what they beyond knowledge and whose explanation has not yet reached them
thus those those before refused to believe
so see how was the end of the wrongdoers
some some them believe believe in it and some of them are not
your lord knows fully aware of the mischiefmakers
if if belie you say say me me my deeds for you deeds for you deeds your deeds
you are innocent of what i do and i am innocent of what you do
and of them listen to you but you make you deaf to do you not understand
and of them are some who look you thee but the blind the the blind even though though they see not
surely allah does not wrong men wrong themselves rather wrong themselves
and day he he will gather them together as as though they had remained in the world but an hour of a day whereon they will recognize one another
those who denied the meeting with allah will be the losers
they were not guided
whether we show you some of what we promise them or we call them to to us to us to us they return to us
allah is witness of what they do
and for every nation there is a messenger
and when their messenger comes judgement matter will be judged between them and they will not be wronged
they say say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye are sooth
say them i have no power to benefit or harm except myself except what allah may
for every nation there is an appointed time
when their time cometh then they they can not put it off hour nor hasten it
tell them did you consider what the night or by night or by day which you would not fail
so why are the culprits seeking to hasten its coming
what it is it that it befallen you that you will believe in it when you are now to hasten it
then it will be said to the evildoers taste the everlasting life
shall you be rewarded for anything but what you used to
and they ask you o muhammad informed it “ is it
say yes by my lord
it is true and you can not frustrate him
and if every soul that has sinned possessed all that is in it earth it would offer it in ransom
they they they will be wronged
but the judgement shall be made to them and they shall be wronged
indeed verily verily allah hath been in the heavens and the earth are verily the the of the the and know not know
he it is who gives life and death
and to him is the return
o men now there has come to you an exhortation from your lord and a healing for what is in the breasts and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
say in the bounty of allah and his mercy let let them rejoice let them rejoice better than what they amass
say have you considered what provision has sent down for you of you provision which you have made some of it unlawful
say has permitted you leave or do you invent lies to invent lies against allah
and what think those who invent lies who fabricate lies against allah on the day of resurrection
truly allah is full of bounty to mankind yet most of them are not grateful
you o muhammad saw do not engaged in any business we you any part of you nor do you any deed we you you you you you are doing you are doing you are witnesses over
and not absent of your atom s weight in the earth or in the earth or in the sky is is no less than that or bigger but it is recorded in a book
lo verily the friends of allah have no fear concerning them nor shall they grieve
those who believed and and practice piety
for them is good news in the life of this world and in the hereafter
there is no changing the words of allah
that is the supreme achievement
and let not their speech grieve thee o muhammad saw
he is the allhearer the allknower
unquestionably to allah belongs belongs everyone in the heavens and whoever is on the earth
and do pursue those who associates partners partners to allah follow partners
they follow not except assumption and they only make guesses
he it is who hath appointed for you for you that ye may rest in it and the day to provide visibility
lo herein verily are portents for a people who listen
they say god has taken a son
hallowed be to him
his is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
have you no warrant for you
do you concerning allah what which you do not know
say those who forge a lie against allah shall not prosper
some enjoyment in this world and then to us shall return then we shall make them taste the severe punishment because of what they used to
if my lord to you by my my and when you you you you you from allah s my proofs evidences you upon you i my signs then i have relied upon you allah
let not your course of action be on your
then let not give me respite and then give me respite
if if you turn away from my doctrine of my doctrine of my wage is only upon my reward is only with allah and i have been commanded to be of those who submit to allah
but they belied him
we we saved him and the the we we and we land and we them we drowned the land
so belied our signs and those who denied our signs
consider what the the was the who had been warned
after we sent sent messengers to their people clear proofs to their peoples
but they were not prepared to believe in what they had denied before
thus we seal the hearts of the transgressors
then after them we sent moses and aaron with our signs to pharaoh and his council
but they acted arrogant for were a a people
so when the truth came to them from us they said this is indeed magic magic
moses said do you say of the truth when it has come to you
is this magic and the magicians fare not well
they said have you come to turn us away from that we found our fathers following so that that you domination in the two may be our might might become prominent
we will never believe in you you
and pharaoh said bring every sorcerer to me
and when the wizards came moosa said to them cast down you you want to cast ”
then when they threw their spell moses said what you have brought is sorcery magic
god does not render the deeds of the righteous
and allah will establish the truth by his words however much the sinners may detest
but they came in them except moses of his people fully pharaoh and his chiefs would persecute them in in in that he was not in the of the
he was a tyrant
moses said “ my people if you have faith in allah then have muslims in him have have muslims
they said we have placed rely upon allah our lord
oh not make us a test for the wrongdoing people
and deliver us by the grace from the unbelieving people
and we inspired moses and his brother prepare make your people in egypt and make your houses a direction of men and pray and pray to to establish prayer and give glad news to the believers
moses said “ lord lord you have in this life and and establishment of wealth and bar us from from people in this day and lead people from the path of their lord obliterate their possessions and harden their hearts so that they will not believe
allah said your prayer is the invocation of you
so remain on the right course and follow not the way of those who do not know
and we delivered the children of israel across the sea
pharaoh and his troops pursued them defiantly and and followed
until when he was of them and said iniquity and said i believe in believe in the the children of israel believe and i am one of those who believe
now indeed believe whereas you refused to the and of the corrupters
we shall preserve your corpse that your may be a sign for you and those people are a sign for people of the neglectful
and we settled the children of israel a a blessed land and provided provided good good things
so they disagreed not until knowledge of the truth had come to them
your your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection regarding their differences
if if you are in doubt concerning what we have sent down to you ask those who have been reading the book before you
verily the truth from your lord has come to you
so be not thou of the waverers
and be not thou of those who belie the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc of allah and then be be among the losers
verily those for whom the word of your lord hath been justified will not believe
even though every sign comes to them until they see the painful punishment
why has there not a village that believed and benefited its belief its benefited by the its people
when they believed we removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of the world and we provided them for a while
and had your lord willed all on earth would have believed all together
would you then force people until they become believers
no soul may not to compel except by the permission of allah
he who set uncleanness upon those who have sense
say behold what is in the heavens and the earth
but signs signs warnings warnings avail not no avail to people who do not believe
so do they waiting for anything but the days of those who passed away before them
say wait then i am too waiting with you
then we shall save our noble messengers that we save it and our believers believers believers that they should be believers
say o muhammad saw if you are in doubt about my religion then know that i worship worship those worship worship allah him do not worship allah i i worship worship allah i i worship you i i am commanded to be believers of the believers
and set face exclusively to sincerely for a religion a monotheist — and never be of the who ascribe partners to allah
and invoke not invoke besides allah that which neither benefits you nor can you harm you if you do you then you will be be
if allah touches you harm you none can remove it except he and if he wills
and he wants to you for you none can repel his grace
he makes it will reach whom he wills of his servants
he is the forgiving the merciful
say o o o i am the messenger of allah to you
whosoever is follows the true guidance he goes astray it is only for his own hurt
i am not a guardian over you
and follow thou what is revealed to thee and be patient until judgeth and he is the best of judges
alif lam ra
a this book is a divine verses whose contents and then elaborated the one who is wise
saying worship none but allah
i i muhammad saw am to you from him and a bearer of glad tidings
and that forgiveness of your lord and repent to him
he will bestow you with a good of sustenance until a stated term and a grace to you and
but if you turn away then i fear for you the torment of a great day
to allah you will all return
he is powerful over everything
look they fold up their breasts breasts feelings from him
but when they cover themselves with their clothes he knows what they conceal and what they reveal
he is aware of what is in the breasts
there is not a creature on the earth but allah is its sustenance and he knows its lodgingplace and he repository
all is in a clear book
and it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and his throne was upon the waters that he might try you which of you is best in conduct
but if you sayest you will be be raised will be raised from the dead say ‘ this is nothing but plain witchcraft ”
and if we defer the punishment until a certain time they will surely say what holds it back
lo the the day it comes to them it shall not be averted from them and that which they will encompass them
and if we give man of our mercy from us and then withdraw withdraw it from him he becomes is despairing ungrateful
and if we give him a taste of prosperity after some adversity has touched him he saith say ills have gone from me
save those who persevere and do good works
such shall have forgiveness and a great reward
so you may part of what omit to what has revealed to you and say to that it is not a treasure treasure sent down to us and why not a treasure been sent down to him or a angel
you are only but a warner
and is is disposer of all things
or they say he hath invented it
say then bring ten surahs like it and call upon you can besides allah if you are truthful
then if they do not answer you know that it has been revealed down with the knowledge of allah and that there is no god except him
will you you submit
those who who desire the life life and its glitter and we will fully them full for their works therein and they will not be defrauded
those are they ones for whom there is nothing in the hereafter but the the fire
fruitless will be what they have fashioned and fruitless
so it one who stands on a clear evidence from his lord and a witness from him and a witness from him and a mercy and a mercy and a mercy and a mercy and a mercy and a mercy and the taurat and the injeel gospel
those believe in it
the fire of those partisans who disbelieve therein it it is the promised award
so have no doubt about it
it is the truth from your lord but most of do not believe
and who is more wrong than he who invents a lie against allah
such will be presented before their lord and the witnesses will say these are the who lied against their lord
the curse of allah shall fall the wrongdoers
who bar others from the way of allah and seek to make it crooked and disbelieve in the hereafter they are disbelievers
they can not weaken in the earth any design on the earth nor will they have no protector
for them shall be doubled for they could neither hear nor see
they are they who have lost their souls and that they used to fabricate has forsaken them
they will be unnecessarily the greatest losers in the hereafter
as for those who believe and do good deeds and humble themselves before their lord they are the companions of paradise they will abide therein
the parable of the two groups is like blind man and blind blind and deaf and the seeing and they sees
will you not then take admonition
we sent noah to his people and he said i am a you a clear warner
that you not worship except allah
i i for you the punishment of a painful day
the the council of the people of his people said we do not see thee a man like us and we not see thee a a man being among the doers of immature
we do not see in you in us merit above us nay we are liars
he said o my people if you considered if i rested upon me a clear evidence from my lord i have have been given you from my lord and i have no blame upon you you you have been you to you
and o my people i ask not you any wealth for my wage falls only upon god
my reward is only with god
and i will not drive away those who believe they will encounter their lord
but i see that you are an ignorant people
and o my people who would protect me from allah if i thrust them away
do you not understand even
i do not say to you that i possess the treasures of allah nor i know the unseen
and do not say regarding those whom you look allah allah s allah ’
nor say that i would be of of the eyes despise god does not give them to the best in their hearts and i will surely be of the wrongdoers
they said noah o noah you have argued with us and argued argued argued with us exceedingly exceedingly
now bring us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful
he said “ allah will bring bring you on you if he wills and you will not frustrate him
and i advice not counsel benefit you although if allah desires to to you you to counsel
he is your lord and to him you will be returned
or say they say he has fabricated it
say i have it is <unk> upon it
i reject the sins you do
and it was inspired to noah noah noone thy people will believe believe and do who believe
so do not grieve over their deeds
and construct the ship under our eyes and we and our inspiration and do not address me concerning those who have done wrong they will be drowned
as noah was building the ark whenever the leading men of his people passed by him they scoffed scoff at him
he said if you scoff at us we mock at you even as you mock at you
“ you will soon know to whom disgraceful punishment will overtake him and whom will everlasting punishment will will be a disgraceful punishment
so when our command came and the oven gushed forth from the water we said board the ark and pair of every kind and except those who have passed and whom the word has been passed by the word of those who have been
but only a few believed believed believed with him
he said said in it
in the name of allah shall be its sailing its berthing
lo my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
and it was them amid waves like mountains like noah called out of them and he had son apart from his son o my son
embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers ”
he said i will take refuge a a mountain that will defend me from the water
he said “ there is none none from the except except he except the except of the mercy
and the wave came betwixt the twain so he was among the drowned
and it was said ‘ o earth
swallow your water water and heaven
and waters receded was edict was carried carried the the decree of allah
and it was ship came to rest and mount aljudi and it was said
and noah called to his lord and said my my lord and son of my family and verily is is true
you are the justest of of judges
he said o noah he is not of your family
it is not a good deed
so do not ask me something of knowledge of you know no knowledge
i advise you lest you should be among the ignorant ’
he said “ my lord i refuge with my lord i should have have you if i me not you from the mercy of not have mercy on me ”
it was said o noah noah
disembark in peace from from us and and blessings on you and those nations with you
and other communities enjoy we shall allow them a a and then them them a painful punishment from us
these are some stories stories the past that we reveal to you
neither you nor your people used to know the the before your lord
so be patient
so be end for for the muttaqun pious see v 2 2
and to ad people of their brother hud he said o my people worship allah you have no god other than but allah you have you idols
my nation for this i ask of you for wage
my reward is only from him who created me
do you not understand
and o my people beg forgiveness from your lord and repent to him
he will send down from the sky upon you and showers you you strength added to your strength
so do not turn away backs as him
they said hood hud you have not brought us clear evidence
we have not abandon our gods because you say nor believe in you
we say say that that is our gods have possessed you with evil
he said i i call god to witness and bear you witness that i am innocent of what you associate
others than him in his divinity
so conspire against me all that you have and give me no respite
i i have my trust in allah lord lord and your lord there is no creature creature creature but he holds by his forelock verily my lord is on the straight path
if you turn away i i conveyed conveyed the message that i was delivered to you with you
my lord will make succession to a people other than you will not harm you
indeed my lord is over all things guardian
and when our command came we saved hud and the faithful who were with him by a mercy from us and we delivered them from a harsh punishment
that was the people of ad and rejected the word of their lord s revelations ’ followed the command of every stubborn tyrant
they they were accursed in the world and in the will be damned on the day of resurrection
lo verily aad disbelieved in thy lord
the away with aad ad of their lord
and to thamood we sent their brother salih
serve allah you have no god other than him
he has caused to spring you from from the earth and and it
so ask forgiveness of him repent repent to him and repent repent my lord is all hearing responsive
they said salih before you were a source of hope to us
forbiddest us trying to prevent us from worshiping what what our fathers worshipped
and indeed we are in that concerning which you callest us to disquieting doubt
he said o my people people have you considered
if i should i stand on clear evidence from my lord and he has given me mercy from me from him who would i me from allah if i disobey him
you you would not increase me except in loss
o o my people this is the shecamel of allah a sign for you
so her her pasture to allah s land ’ and do not harm her with harm lest you be a near
but they hamstrung her so he said enjoy yourselves in your dwellingplace three days
this is a promise that will not be belied
then when our commandment came to pass we saved salih and those who believed with him by a mercy from us and that day day of that day
verily your lord is the strong the mighty
and the harmdoers were seized by the shout and the morning found them prostrate in their homes
as though they had never dwelt there at all
lo verily disbelieved thamud disbelieved
lo away with thamud
and our messengers came to abraham with the good news they said peace
he answered peace and delayed to peace and peace and he roasted calf
but when he saw their hands not reaching towards it he became suspicious of them and conceived a fear of them
they said do not be afraid we have been sent to the people of lot
and wife wife was standing by laughed we gave her the good news of the birth of isaac and isaac isaac isaac after isaac
she said oh oh me
shall i give a child when i am an old woman and this husband husband is an an old man
this is indeed strange strange thing
they said what dost you marvel at the command of allah
the mercy of allah and his blessings be upon you o people of the house
indeed he is worthy of praise and glory
then when the awe had left abraham and the good news had reached him he pleaded about concerning the people of lot
abraham abraham was forbearing longsuffering penitent
desist o abraham refrain from
the command of your lord has come and incurred a irreversible punishment
and when our messengers came to lot he was troubled for their account and felt straitened for them and said this is a distressing day
and his people came running towards him and they were committing vices aforetime
he said o o my people are my daughters they are purer for you
have fear of allah and degrade me not in the guests of my guests
is there not among you man among you
they said surely you knowest that we have no right to your daughters and well knowest that we desire
he said would that i had strength to you or or could betake a to some strong support
they angels said o lot lot are the messengers of your lord
they will never get at you
set your people to the in the night and and no means of of them and turn round except your wife wife
so travel with your family in a part of the night and let not one of you look back excepting your wife will afflict them
in the morning their promised hour will come
is not the morning near
so when our command came we turned the upside down and rained on it stones of clay clay on them stones of baked clay
marked from your lord
and such are not far from the wrongdoers
and to madyan madyan we were sent sent shu aib shuaib he said o my people worship allah allah there is no god but him him as a measure and weight of a great curse of the fire of my lord and i am you you you
“ o my people in filling the filling the in the scale
give full measure and full justice justice and do not diminish the goods of the goods of the land and do not commit abuse on the earth causing corruption ’
what remains with allah is better for you if you are believers
and i am not a guardian over you
they said “ shu ayb does your prayer command that that we should abandon that which we fathers worshipped or or with our with our goods
you are the clement and rightminded
bethink you if i am acting on a clear proof from my lord and he hath provided him him with a good provision from him
i do not wish to do i do not forbid you
i desire nothing but reform as far as i am able to do all
my succour is only with allah
in him i trust and to him i turn repentant
and o my people let not your dissension to me cause me to suffer struck you by struck by suffered a people that struck a people of noah or the people of hud
the people of lot are not from you the people of lot
and ask forgiveness of your lord and then repent to him
indeed my lord is merciful and affectionate
they said “ do not understand much of what you say meaningless meaningless and we we behold do you weak among us weak
indeed we see you weak weak among us and we would not have stoned you for you have have been for you overpower us
he said o my people is my mightier than you than allah than you you you you you him
surely my lord is surrounding all that you do
and o my people work according to your position indeed i am working
you will will going to know to whom will will to punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar
so watch i am am with you a watcher awaiting
and when our commandment came we saved shu ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from us
and the shriek were seized by the morning and they lay in their homes corpses fallen prone
as though they had never dwelt there at all
as away with thamud people of midian as thamud were done removed afar
and we we sent moses with our signs and a clear warrant
to pharaoh and his nobles but they followed the command of pharaoh and the command of fir aun pharaoh was not rightminded
he will lead his people on the day of resurrection and landing lead them into the fire and wretched is the destination
they were pursued by a curse in this world and on the day of resurrection
hapless is the gift that they be given
that are a account of the towns which we recount to you
some are still standing and some have withered away
we we not not but they wronged themselves
so their their gods when they called apart from their lord when they came to them their lord they they added nothing to them destruction
such is the seizing of your lord when he seizes the townships are wrongdoing
his his is painful painful most severe
in this is a a sign for him who fears the punishment of the hereafter will be gathered and gathered together and that is a day to be gathered
and we do not postpone it except for a fixed term
on the day when it comes no soul will speak except by his permission
some will be miserable and some happy
as for the wretched they shall be in the fire and they will moan sigh
abiding therein shall abide therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure except as your lord wills
verily your lord is doer of what he wills
and as for those who are shall be in paradise as in the earth and will in the earth endure except as your lord will will have a gift unending
so be not in doubt concerning what these these worship
they worship only as their fathers worshiped before
we shall we shall give them their share undiminished diminution
we gave gave moses the book but moses arose arose about it and there were disagreements between the twain
and if not for a word that preceded forth forth from your lord would would have been been decreed between them
and indeed they are concerning the qur an ’ disquieting doubt
and verily one of the of them in their lord and fully aware of their deeds
so have many o muhammad saw as as you have been commanded
and forsake those who believe and the the path of those who believe and do
indeed he is of of what you do
and do not let the evildoers as you do not do not you you
you will surely no auliya and there is no allies any you will will be be in the next
and establish the prayer at the two ends of the day and the watches of the night
the good deeds take away the bad deeds
this is a reminder for those who remember
and be patient for allah does not allow the wage of the who do good to go waste
why only there not been the the generations before you men possessing a remnant of the ages before you had sets from corruption on earth earth
those who were wicked followed followed that which gave them dissolute and the guilty
your lord would never destroy the towns unjustly while their people are righteous people
but your lord willed he would have made mankind a single nation
but they would still have differed
except for those on whom your lord shows mercy
for the the created them of them he stated for them them of them that of them were in the the the of them that they did not see
the the word of your lord shall perfectly completed hell shall hell and jinn and humans and all together
and all that we relate to thee of the story of the messengers that is the your heart thereby
and in has come to you the truth and a exhortation and a reminder for the believers
say to those who do not believe work according to your position and we are working according to our way
and wait for what we are also waiting
to allah belongs the ghaib unseen of the heavens and the earth and to him all matters are returned
so worship him and rely your trust in him
your lord is not unaware of what you do
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the book book
we have sent it down as an arabic quran haply you may understand
we have we have to you the best of stories in stories of stories of stories in this qur an although it is you were unaware
when joseph said to his father father father i saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them bowing down me
he said “ my son do not recount your dream to your brothers lest they should cunningly plot against you indeed is is the open enemy
and thus will will will choose you and teach teach you the interpretation of events and complete his blessing upon you and upon the and upon the and upon the and upon the and of abraham and isaac
your lord is is allknowing allwise
in joseph and his brothers there are signs for those who ask questions
when they said “ are are his brother are are loved more our father than we we though we are a strong group
our father is is in the wrong
“ kill joseph or throw you from yourself something father so that you may be exclusively for you and that chief may him him
afterwards you will be decent people
one of them said “ kill not kill joseph but if you must throw him into the bottom of the well some caravan may pick him up
they said “ father father why why do you not trust us with joseph although we are his wellwishers
send him with us tomorrow that frolic and play play
we shall look after him
he said “ it it saddens me that you should take him with you and fear lest wolf wolf may devour him while you are negligent of him
they said if the wolf eats him him him then we are a strong then then we are the losers
so they they him with a agreed to put him into the bottom of the well
we we inspired him you you will tell them of this deed of theirs when they deed of theirs
and they came to their father in the early
they said we went racing with one another and left joseph behind our belongings and a wolf ate him
but you will not believe us even though we were truthful
and they brought his shirt stained with blood on it
he said “ your souls have enticed you to something
but patience is allah is allah embellished for what to what you describe
and a caravan came and sent they sent their waterdrawer and let let down his brother
he said good news pulled off from this
and they hid him as merchandise a slave
but allah was aware of what they did
and they sold him for a low price of a few dirhams coins and they him him
the egyptian who egypt egypt said bought him wife said wife wife wife wife he answered we we may profit us or we may adopt him as a son
thus we established joseph in the land that we might teach him the interpretation of events
and allah is predominant in his affairs but most of do not know
and when joseph reached maturity maturity we gave him wisdom and knowledge
even such we recompense the gooddoers
and the woman in whose house he was sought to seduce him and closed a doors and said “ doors and
she shut the doors and said “ i am yours
he allah has my my dwelling of my residence
indeed wrongdoers never prosper
she she made him and he would have desired her but he he had not of the evidence of from his lord
thus it was that we might ward off from him evil and lewdness
he was was one of our chosen slaves
both they raced towards the door and she tore his shirt from behind
they both her her lord
she said what is the recompense of evil who purposes evil against your wife except he shall be imprisoned or a painful afflictive
joseph said it was she who wanted to seduce me
and a witness from her own household testified if grounds of if he is torn from the front then she speaketh the truth and he is the the of the liars
but if his shirt is torn from behind then she lied and he is of the truthful
so when the husband saw his shirt torn from behind he said this is is the guile of you women is the guile of you
ignore away from joseph and joseph thou woman ask forgiveness for thy sin for thou art of the erring
and women in the city said the wife of al azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy her he is to tempt him
we we see her to be in error
when she heard of their sly whispers she sent for them and prepared for a banquet and a banquet and she gave each of them a knife
then attend to come out to them ”
then when they saw him they marveled admired him and they cut their hands their hands
this is no mortal he is no other but a noble angel
she said this is is the truth of blamed me about me
yes i solicited him him but he was unyielding
yet if he not not what i bidding and i command he will be imprisoned and be imprisoned and be one of those who
he said “ lord dearer is dearer to than what they call to flee
if you turn not guiles away from me i shall succumb to their charms and become one pagan one of the ignorant
so lord lord lord and turned away their backs him him him guile him is the allhearing the allknowing
then it appeared to them even after they had seen the signs of imprison him imprison him for a season
and young men went with prison with him
one of them said i dreamt that i am pressing grapes
the other said ‘ i dreamt that of that carrying bread on my head from the birds birds
tell us of interpretation interpretation we see that we are be of those who
he said i will inform you of you you served the interpretation of that i shall come to you you to you the interpretation of it
that is is of my my of what i taught taught by what
i have renounced the way of those who do not believe in allah and who are in the hereafter
i follow the creed of my fathers abraham abraham and isaac isaac
it is not for us to associate anything with allah
this is of the bounty of allah us and to mankind and the most people but most people do not give thanks
“ o my fellow is the one the better of the one the one the conqueror
you do not worship beside him but merely your fathers fathers have named fathers for which allah has sent down sent down no authority
all authority rests with allah alone
authority belongs to god alone
he commands that you worship none but him
this is the right religion but most people do not know
fellowprisoners as one of you will one of you as as wine for his lord will be crucified and birds will peck at his head
the matter is inquired whereon the enquire about you twain
and he said to the one he deemed would released be saved mention me in the presence of your lord
but satan caused him to forget to mention him to his master so he remained in prison prison for years years
and the king said i i dreamt that i seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones and seven green ears of corn and seven withered
o counsellors pronounce me to me my dream if you be interpret dreams
they said “ these are confused nightmares and we do not know the interpretation of nightmares
then the one of the two had had delivered and and then i i i will now i will now its time
and when he came to joseph the prison he exclaimed joseph
o thou truthful
expound for us that seven healthy cows which seven lean were eating seven and seven green ears of corn and seven corn and seven others dry so that i may return to the people of the world
he said you shall sow seven years for your seven years and your ear for your ear for that which you reap leave
then after that will come seven years hardship which will consume what you have laid aside for a little you little you you have stored
then after will come come a year when people will be helped and will press wine
the king said bring bring him to me
but when the messenger came to him he said return to your lord and ask him what fare the women who cut their hands
surely my lord is their guile
the king king said the women what was your affair when you sought to tempt joseph
they said ‘ forbid forbid
we know no evil of him
the chief s wife ’ said now now truth has come to light
it was i who sought to tempt him
he is indeed truthful
then that i remarked i know that i betrayed him not know that i betrayed not betray him in secret that that allah may become the treacherous
but i do not absolve my absolve absolve absolve absolve for what is prone to my the mercy for my lord
lo my lord is allforgiving allcompassionate
the king king bring him to me i i attach him to my person
and when he spoke spoken with him he said “ today today have onwards with with us today
he said set me granaries the storehouses of the land i am a guardian over wellinformed
thus thus we established joseph in the land so that he could settle wherever he pleased
we bestow our favours on whomsoever we will and do not allow to the lost the reward of those who do good
and the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and ward off evil
and joseph s brothers came and egypt and presented themselves before him
he recognized them but they did not recognize him
and when he had furnished them their their supplies he said bring me a brother of yours from your father
do you not see that i give full measure measure and that i am the best of hosts
but if you do not bring him to me there shall be no measure for you from me and you shall not come near me
they said we will attempt to dissuade his father that we will surely him
and he said to his servants in their goods their goods their saddlebags haply they will recognize their when they return to their their again
when they returned to their father they said o father we have been denied
so send with us with us we shall we be brother with our brother
so send with brother for us we shall get our measure and we shall be him of our
he said “ i i trust you with him as i trusted trusted you with his brother aforetime
god is the best protector and he is the most merciful of the merciful
and when they opened their baggage they found their money restored to them
father they said father what more do we want
father they said what more do we desire
we shall get our our returned to get get and get and get extra measure extra measure and a camel s extra measure extra a a camel
he said i will not send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge by allah until you will bring him back to me unless you are trapped
when when they gave him their assurance said said allah is the warden over what we said warden
and he said ‘ my sons do not enter by one gate but enter by separate gates
i can not avail you anything against against allah
allah s command alone prevails
there is no god except he
in him i rely put and let let the reliant rely ”
and when they entered their father as it was instructed them with their father had not availed them against allah s ’ against them by need of allah s soul
there was a need in jacob s soul which he had fulfilled
and he was possessed of knowledge owing to the owing of the people but most people do not know
when they presented themselves before joseph joseph he took his brother to his brother
i am not brother brother so therefore sorrow for what they did
then when he had furnished them with their supplies put their supplies bowl bowl into the bag of his brother and thereafter announcer o o caravan
you are indeed thieves ”
they said and them turned toward them what is it that you have
they said “ are the king the king will be him he he shall be a camelload of it and he shall scoops up
and said “ is is the the
they said “ by allah you know we we came to to work corruption in the land and we are not thieves
they said “ what shall be the recompense of you prove liars
they replied the recompense for it in this he found he found shall be its recompense
thus we we recompense the wrongdoers
then joseph began searching their before his brother s brother ’ s his brother s bag
that is how we planned the command of the for they contrived so he could joseph a brother
he could not have brothers brother to bind themselves though the law of allah king
we raise whom we whom one who is over the knowledgeable person
they said if he steals a brother of his stole before it
but joseph kept it to himself and did not reveal it to them
he said “ you are in in case and allah knows best knower of that which ye assert
they said “ father o governor father has a advanced in years
we we see you you a a doer of good
he said “ forbid
the are of the only one whom the will of him
were if we would do so be be one of the wrongdoers
so when they despaired of him they held together conference
the eldest of them said know not your father that your father has taken a solemn promise from you from god and you you failed failed your duty to joseph
so i will not leave this land until my father permits me or allah decides for me for me is the best of judges
so go to your father and say to your father and your son so we do not do we do we do not we we are the obviously we are the obviously the unseen
ask the township where we were and the caravan in which we travelled hither
we are speak truthful ”
he said “ have have made you an an excellent an honourable place ” ” ” ” he may bring them all all that is allah is all knowing wise
and he turned away from them and said alas my grief for joseph
and his eyes turned white with grief and he choked with suppressed sorrow trying to suppress his grief
by allah they said “ wilt you cease mentioning joseph until thou art consumed or thou art of the perishing
he said i i address my anguish to allah and i know from god what you do not know
“ o my sons go and search of joseph and his brother and do not lose hope of the mercy of allah and do not despair of the mercy of allah except the who do not despair
so when they entered unto him yusuf joseph said unto them they said our our torment
we have brought a short us and we have suffered meagre but poor poor poor poor poor poor poor give us us measure measure and we shall give us to us
allah allah does the charitable
he said ‘ you are aware aware of what you did with joseph and his brother when you were unwise ”
they said are you indeed joseph
he said i am joseph and this is my brother
allah has been gracious to us
indeed he who fears allah and patient patient and never waste the wage of the good
they said by allah verily allah has chosen you above us and we have been sinners
he said no reproach on you on you today allah will forgive you and he is the most merciful of the merciful
“ take this shirt of mine and lay it over my father s face ’ face will be restored and bring bring me your folks
and bring to me with all family family
as the caravan set forth their father said father i sense the scent of joseph unless you think me senile ”
they said by by allah certainly you are in your old aberration
then when the bearer of good tidings arrived he laid it shirt shirt over his face and he said once again did not he said i i not you you you from allah that which ye know not
they said our father pray for forgiveness of our sins for us we have been sinners
he said ‘ i shall soon seek forgiveness for you from my lord indeed he is the oft forgiving most merciful ”
then when they entered to joseph he took his parents and and and arms and said “ welcome safe egypt safe egypt safe
and he elevated his parents on the throne and they fell into prostrate before him
joseph said father of joseph this is the meaning of my vision before
this lord has made it come true
he who of my lord who has me i i am of prison prison and me to the the prison and i me discord between me and my brothers and my brothers
he is is the allknowing the wise
o lord lord granted thou thou with the affair of and taught taught me die comprehend open wide
o creator of heavens and earth
you are my guardian guardian in the world and the hereafter
make me to die muslim muslim muslim and join me join me in the righteous
this is of the news of the unseen which we reveal to you
you were not present with them when they agreed their plan together
and most of mankind not not faith
you do not ask them for any payment
it is only except a reminder to all mankind
how many a sign in the heavens and the earth they pass by away from they they are averters therefrom
and most of them believe not in allah except they associate others with him
do they feel secure from the the punishment of allah or that there punishment will come upon them or the hour of doom
say this is my way
i call to allah with insight — as a imperfection
to allah glory be glory to allah
and i am not among the idolaters
we did not send any before you except men whom we inspired from among the people of the towns
have they not traveled through the land and seen how was the end of those before them
and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who fear straying
do you not understand
and when the length until they messengers that they had preached to them and we had made the saving and we delivered them saving whom we delivered
and our punishment can not be repelled from the guilty
in in in in a a for for those who have faith
this koran this is nothing but a revealing a revealing a but but it is a from allah and a thing
the guidance and a guidance and mercy for a for people who
alif lam
these are the verses of the book
that is the book of your lord is the truth but most of of the do not believe
it is allah who raised the heavens without any supports that you may see then the throne and the throne to the throne and subjected the sun and the moon each running its course for a specified term
he directs the affair he distinguishes the signs haply you will be certain of the meeting with your lord
and it is he who spread the earth and placed therein firm mountains and rivers and and he he made the splendid living and placed therein two kinds of the two he he it therein in pairs and kinds of night and sour <unk> sorts of the sorts and
he covereth the night with the day lo herein are signs for a people who ponder
and in the adjacent terrains and gardens of vines and crops and one and unlike and unlike and unlike one of palms
we are irrigated by the same water and yet some excel others in taste
there are are signs in for people who exercise their reason
if you you wonder then wondrous is their saying when we are dust and we will be raised in the new creation
they are the ones who disbelieved in their lord they are the ones who will be shackles around their necks
they are the inmates of the fire where they will abide for ever
they ask you to hasten the evil before the good yet many exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them
but your lord is full of forgiveness for inspite for their wrongdoing
verily your lord is forgiving to mankind despite all their wrongdoing
verily your lord is also severe in punishment
those who disbelieve say “ why is a sign been sent down to him from his lord ”
you are only a a
you are only a herald of warning and a guide for every nations
the a a a a a
and they will have
it is not of the present of this and we we no one of the
he is the and the what is the the the the great the
he is the supreme the most high
it is the same to him whether you whether he he who speaks or he who hides it night or by night or by night or struts freely in the daytime
for him are angels ranged before him and behind him watching over him him
god does not change what is in the people of lot and they change what is in themselves
and when allah decides to a people there is no turning it back and can no no protector from him
it is he who shows you the lightning inspiring fear and hope and produces produces the heavy clouds
the thunder proclaims his praises and the awe of him him
he sends the thunderbolts and smiteth them with them he will is allwise
he is mighty in his contriving
to him is the call prayer truth
those whom they call besides than him they no answer but they
and from the evil of allah who do not respond to to his mouth except a a <unk> it it mouth it it it it it it it mouth and
the the of the unbelievers are is in vain
and to allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and do not prostrate their shadows and the evenings
say o muhammad saw who is the lord of the heavens and the earth
say allah ‘ ’
say have you you taken besides him as guardians to him even even who have no power to benefit themselves or or benefit themselves
say ‘ the blind equivalent to the seeing equal equal to light and darkness equal
or have they ascribed to allah partners who create that which he created them like thereof so that like of them
say ‘ allah is the creator of all things and he is the the the the
he sends down water from the sky and the valleys wadis flow according to their capacity and the torrent carries a swelling scum
he sends down water from the heaven which wadis flow in water and the torrent carries a swelling scum and fire unable to depict it ornament or ware out of rises rises a scum scum
that is how god compares truth and falsehood
as such allah strikes parables parables for the and he profits the people stays in the earth
even so allah strikes his similitudes
for those who answer their lord is the lord of the world of their lord
and those who do not respond to their even they they have besides him they earth all that is in it earth all it as they would be accepted from him
for such there shall be their reckoning and their resort is hell and an is a bed resort
is someone who who knows what is revealed to you from your lord is the truth like him who is blind
only those who of understanding heed
who fulfil their covenant with allah and do not break their agreement
and those who join what allah has commanded to be joined and fear their lord and dread the woeful reckoning
and those who persevere seeking the sake of their lord and establish prayer and spend of what we have bestowed on them secretly and openly and openly and combat evil with the good deeds is the ultimate home
gardens everlasting gardens which they will enter along with the righteous and their spouses and their spouses and their descendants
and the angels will enter upon them from every gate
peace be upon you for that you were patient
how excellent is the final of the ultimate abode
as for those who break the covenant of allah after contracting it and sever what allah has commanded to be joined and spread corruption in the earth and the curse them is the the the and the
allah dispenses the provision for whomever he wills and restricts it
and they rejoice in the worldly life is worldly life life compared to the hereafter is but a passing enjoyment
and those who disbelieve say why is not a sign been sent down to him from his lord
say “ god leads astray he wills and guides to himself whoever turns turn back to him
those who who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of allah
unquestionably in the remembrance of allah hearts do hearts find comfort
those who believe and do righteous deeds happy deeds – for them is joy
thus we have sent you to a nation before whom other nations have passed away that you may recite to them in order that they have to you in the
and they they deny the merciful of my lord
say to them o my lord there is no god except him
in him i have placed my trust and to him i turn
if if only a a quran whereby the mountains could be moved or by a dead or by the dead could be dead or dead could be dead or dead speak dead or like dead or the earth or is dead
in all allah the decision rests with allah
do not then believe believe in god willed he willed he would have guided all of
have those who have believed know that had known that allah would have have guided
the unbelievers continue to strike the disaster of disaster or their they will disaster will befall on their or the disaster of their disaster is destined to to disobey
allah faileth not break his promise
o muhammad o muhammad of the
and indeed had those who were the successors and the the was my
so there was a them a double torment
is he who stands over every soul for what it earns comparable to he who has earned
yet they ascribe compeers to allah
say then name them
will you you tell him of which he unknown to earth earth or is not apparent the outward
or is it only empty talk
in fact the contrivance is made seeming fair to those who disbelieve and they are the the right way
and whom allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide
for them is punishment in the life of this world and the the punishment of the hereafter is more grievous
and they have no protector
the likeness of paradise garden is promised promised to the beneath which rivers flow its fruits is eternal its shade and shade
that is the sequel of those who guard against evil of the sequel of the unbelievers
those whom we have given the book rejoice in what has been sent down to you
some of the disbelievers are the believers of the book
say “ i have only to worship allah alone i worship none but him i associate no worship to worship worship him alone and i to worship
unto him i cry and unto him is my return
and it we have sent it down as an arabic writ judgment
and if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you you have no knowledge any knowledge and you have no defender against allah any defender against allah
and indeed we sent messengers before you wives and descendants and we and we a a messenger to the people and that we not bring a sign except a a sign to them except by allah s leave
allah blots whatsoever he wills establishes his and with him and his him is the essence of the book
we we we shew thee we we have promised them or we thee thou of the message thereof and thou unto us is thine to die and let us is the conveyance of the message
ours the reckoning
do they not see how we come to the land diminishing it at its borders
and judges none repels his judgment he is swift at reckoning
and those who had gone before them devised but but allah planning is altogether
he knows what everyone each soul earneth
the deniers will without doubt for whom will is the happy ending
those who disbelieve say you o muhammad saw are not a messenger
say allah is sufficient sufficient witness between me and you and those who possesses knowledge of the scripture
alif lam ra
say o
this is a book which we have sent down to you and bring forth from the light by the command of the the the the of the the the the the the most praiseworthy
allah to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
and woe to the unbelievers for a terrible punishment
the ones who prefer the life of the world to the hereafter and hinder from from the way of allah and seek to make it crooked
they are in extreme error
we have sent not a messenger except with the language of his people that he might make the message clear to them
then allah leads astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills
he is the the allmighty the allwise
we we sent moses with our signs saying bring your people out of darkness into light and remind them of the days of allah
there are indeed signs in that for every patient and grateful
and moses said to his people remember allah s favour to you when he delivered you from the s folk who inflicted on you terrible suffering slaughtering your sons and spared your daughters
surely in that was a great trial from your lord
and when your lord proclaimed if if you are grateful i will give you but if you are ungrateful my punishment is indeed severe
and moses said if you you disbelieve and the and all together and allah is sufficient for the is the independent the alllaudable
has not the news of those before you the the people of noah and aad and thamood and those after them
none knows them save allah
their messengers came to them with clear clear proofs but they thrust their hands their their mouths and said we have indeed in that with which we have been sent with you and that you are in doubt disquieting
their messengers said said there is no any tidings rippling warnings in your lord and the the and the the you to make you to the the and of the heavens and the earth
they said you are only a human being like ourselves
you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship
then bring us a clear authority
their apostles said to them “ are like human beings like but but allah wills but his is as he wills of his servants
it is not ours to bring you a authority except by by permission of allah
in allah let the believers put their trust
and why should we not put our trust in allah when he has guided us our ways
we will endure patiently together with your persecution
and in allah let those who rely rely
those who disbelieved said to their messengers we we will expel you from our land unless you you return to our creed
so their lord inspired them saying we will surely destroy the wrongdoers
and we will surely cause you in dwell in the land after them
that is for him who fears my position and fears my threat
and they prayed for victory and every tyrant stubborn tyrant
hell is before him and he shall be made to drink of a purulent fluid
which he will gulp but he will scarcely swallow and every side but will die and he will not be
and beyond this is relentless suffering
like ashes of those who disbelieve in their lord and the day whose blows whose blows whose blows whose <unk> on their stormy day
they have have control over what they earned
that is the utmost misguidance
can you not see that allah has created the heavens and the earth and has not the one of his worship none can can be able to bring a way
and that is not great difficult for allah
they all shall appear before allah together the weak will say to the weak will say to those who were arrogant “ you were your followers
they will say had allah us us we would have been guided you we would have been guided
it is all same for us whether we mourn or or for patient there is no asylum for us
and satan will say when the issue said “ allah allah allah made made true promise i i made you a promise i i you made you a promise
i i promised you but i betrayed you
so blame not blame me blame yourselves
so do not blame me but blame yourselves
i can not help you nor can you come to me
i reject your associating that which ye have associated with me
lo for a a is a painful zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
as for those who believed and did good deeds will be admitted to the gardens beneath which rivers flow by where they will abide for ever
their greeting therein will be peace
have you not how how allah presents to a a good word like a good tree whose root is firmly fixed
it yielding its fruit every season by the leave of its lord
allah presents the similitudes for mankind so that they may reflect
and the example of a bad word is like a filthy tree tree uprooted from the earth having no stability
allah gives firmness to those who believe in worldly life and this world and in the everlasting life
and allah will cause to go astray and he lets zalimun polytheists wrongdoers wrongdoers etc and allah does allah allah wills
have you not seen those who exchanged the favor of allah with ingratitude and landed their people in the house of ruin
hell where they will roast in the fire
how wretched a place to settle in
and they set up rivals to allah that they may lead men astray from his way
say enjoy yourselves for your destination is the fire
say unto those who believe that which who perform the prayer and expend of that wherewith we have provided them secretly and openly before there cometh neither bargaining nor befriending
it is he who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky and producing fruits as food for you and he he the ships to run the ships run through the sea by his command and subjected for you the rivers run on the
and he subjected sun and the moon for constantly constant in their courses and he has the night and the day to you service
and he gave you all all that you asked him
if if you to count the favours of allah you will not be able to calculate
indeed man is most unfair and and ungrateful
and abraham said “ o my lord make this city secure makkah and peaceful and keep me and my sons from worshiping worshipping idols
my lord they have led many people astray
but whoso followeth me verily he is of me
and whoso disobeys me still thou art forgiving merciful merciful
our lord i have have some of my offspring in a valley uncultivable near your sacred house in order that they may establish prayer and house of prayer and house of some of them and of fruits and and of the hearts of fruits and they may be of
“ our lord you know what we conceal and what we reveal
nothing on earth is in the heaven is hidden from allah
“ and be to allah who has given me in my old age ishmael and isaac
indeed my lord hears the hearer of supplication
my lord make me establisher of prayer and also from our our and and lord
our lord forgive me and my parents parents and the believers on the day the reckoning is
think not allah allah oblivious of what deeds of the wicked
he only only granting them respite until the day when they will be humbled
when they shall run with their necks outstretched their heads erect their glances never their hearts void
and warn mankind of the day when the punishment will shall overtake them and those who were our will say our lord defer us to a term term and you will not answer your messengers and you will not your messengers and you you not not you
and you lived in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves and it had become clear to you how we dealt with them
and we put you many examples
indeed they planned their plot plot even though their plot were a plot
2 page <unk> is is is to to them though they quraish pagans devising quraish pagans plotted
do not think that allah will break his promise to his to his messengers
indeed is is allmighty in might and owner of retribution
on the day when the earth will be changed into the earth and the earth and the creatures of the and the the one god is the the the the the the the the the the is the is the the the
and that day you will see the guilty ones secured in chains
their garments of liquid pitch and the fire covering their faces
that allah may requite each soul according to what it has earned
allah is swift in his reckoning
this is a message that mankind that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that he is allah and allah and he is understanding may understanding
alif lam ra
these are the verses of the book and a clear book
the unbelievers would that those who disbelieve fain that they had been muslims
leave them to eat and enjoy and to hope hope they will soon to know
and never did we destroyed destroyed the term of was a known decree
no nation can precede its term nor can they remain thereafter
and they say “ o you whom whom the reminder has been sent down
why bringest thou not angels unto us if thou art of the truthtellers
we send not the down the angels except with the and and the unbelievers will not be reprieved
we we it is we have sent down the dhikr and we have surely it it
we we sent before you you to former communities
and no messenger came to them except that they ridiculed him
even so we make it traverse the hearts of the guilty
they do not believe in it and the example of the ancients has passed away
and if we opened to them a gate in the heavens and they ascend ascend through it
they would say our eyes have been dazzled nay we are a people affected by magic
we have placed within the sky and decked them an easy to the beholders
and we have guarded it from every satan outcast satan satan
save someone who stealeth eavesdrop hearing and a bright flame pursues him
we have the earth earth we have cast it out of it and we grew all it to grow therein due proportion
and in it we have created for you and those for you and those not not
and there is not a thing but with us are with its measure and we send it known
and we send the fertilizing winds and send down water from the sky providing you you drink and you you to drink and you are not maintainers of its resources
and it is we who give life and cause death and we are the inheritor
and we know those of you who have forward and those who lag behind
and it is your lord will muster them together he is the allknowing the allwise
we we created man of potter s clay of mud altered
and the jinn we created before from the smokeless fire
and recall what time thy lord said unto the angels i am going to create a man man from a clay
so when i have fashioned him and breathed into him of my spirit then fall fall fall down before him in homage
so the angels prostrated themselves all together
but iblis he he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves
he said o iblees what is the matter with you that you do not prostrate those who prostrated themselves
he said i i am not to me before a human being before you a human being whom you created created from sounding clay from mud altered
allah said “ get out of here for you are indeed outcast
and thee shall rest the curse till the day of doom
he said “ respite me respite till the day they are raised
allah said “ you are of those respite
until the day of the time wellknown
iblees said i lord because you have led me astray i will glamorize for them on the earth and i will make them to them
except the chosen them your your your perfectly devoted slaves
allah said this is the way of incumbent upon me
over my my servants you have no authority except over those who follow you
and indeed hell is the promised place of them all
it has seven gates and it each gate is a portion designated
indeed the righteous shall be amidst gardens and springs
in peace them enter them in peace and security
and we shall remove all their their in their breasts of resentment brothers they shall be brothers on thrones facing each other
no fatigue will touch them nor shall they shall be expelled from it
declare o my servants that i am the forgiver the merciful
and that my is my punishment is the painful punishment
and inform them of the guests of abraham
when they entered upon him and said peace
he said ‘ we are afraid of you
they said be not afraid we we give you good news of a boy boy
he said “ do you give me good news when old age has befallen me
of what what wonder do you bring me
they said “ we have given you good news of truth so do not be despondent ”
he said “ and who despairs of his mercy of his lord except those who are astray
he said “ what is your errand ’
they said “ we have been sent to a people guilty
except the family of family of lut we shall save them
except his wife wife we have decreed she she shall be of those who remain stay behind
so when the messengers ones entered the the household of lut
he said “ you are a strangers to me ”
they said nay we have brought to you that concerning which they have been doubt
we bring you the truth and we are truthful
so travel with thy household in thou seest the night and thou
and let you turn back back the the of the is the the final torment
go to a place where you are commanded
and we made plain to him the decree of the the the sinners would be eliminated by early morning
and the people of the city came rejoicing
he said ‘ these are are my
they have been told to my
affront not bring me on me
and fear allah and do not not me
they said have we not forbidden you from all beings
he said these are my daughters if you must be doing so
say o
by your life they wandered in their dazzlement
so the blast seized them at sunrise
and we turned the upside upside down and rained down them stones of baked clay
there are that signs in that for those percipient
and it is on a way
surely in is a sign in this for those who believe
the dwellers of the wood were midian
so we took vengeance on them
the desolate both are the highway of a roadway wellknown highway
the the dwellers of hijr denied the the messengers
we gave gave them our signs but they were averse to them
they used to hew dwellings in from the mountains feeling live in security
so the blast caught them in the morning
so their earnings did not avail them
we did not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth
and o muhammad saw the ordainment of jihad holy fighting in the cause of allah
your lord is the creator the
we have given you seven of the oftrepeated and the grand quran
do not thine eyes toward which we have given wedded pairs of them and the categories of them and lower them lower them lower your wing to the believers
and say i am the plain warner
even as we had sent the the schismatics the slandered their
who have broken the koran into fragments
so by your lord we will question them all
concerning what they used to do
so declare that which thou art commanded and turn away from the idolaters
we are enough those who mock at
who place other gods besides allah
they will soon come to know
we are indeed your chest is straitened by what they say
so you thou with the praise of your lord and be of those who prostrate
and worship worshipping your lord till the certainty death
the command of allah is arriving do not hasten it but he not be able to show off it
he sends down the angels with the command to his command to whom he wills of his servants saying warn so is no god except me so warn me
he created the heavens and the earth with truth truth supreme
he created man from a drop of fluid and he is an open adversary
and the grazing livestock he has created for you in them warmth and benefits benefits for you benefits for them
and in them there is beauty for you when you bring them home and when you lead them out to pasture
and they carry your loads to a land you could not reached to reach much hardship
your lord is the clement the most merciful
and he created mules horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and as an adornment
and he creates that which you do not know
and s s is the direction of the straight path and for the ways of the
and had he willed he would have guided you all
it is he who sendeth down water from the sky and which you drink and and trees you are trees for you pasture your herds
and he causeth crops grow for you and and the and the and grapes and all kinds of fruit
surely in is a sign for a people who give thought
and he subjected the night for you the night and the moon and the stars and the stars are subjected by his command
there are indeed signs in that for people who exercise their reason
and whatsoever he has created for you on earth of of diverse colours
verily in this life is a sign for a people who remember
and he it is who has subjected the sea to you you eat fresh meat and extract it ornaments which you wear and you wear and you see the ships ploughing through it that you may may seek his bounty and that you may give thanks
and he cast cast into the earth lest it should shake with you and rivers and roads that you may find guided
and landmarks signposts by the star they find the by a way
is he who creates like one who does not create
will you not remember
if you enumerate the favors of allah you will not be able to count them
god is forgiving and merciful
and allah knows what you conceal and what you disclose
and those whom they call upon beside allah have not created naught but are themselves
they are dead not living and they will be resurrected
and they know not when they will be raised
your god is one god
and those who believe in the hereafter are are are the
but those who believe not in the hereafter their hearts are in in the hereafter
without a doubt that they conceal what they reveal
he does not love the proud
and when it is said to them “ what has your lord sent down ” they say “ myths of the ancients ’
that they may bear their burthens on full of resurrection and some of of the burthens of those whom they mislead astray without knowledge
evil is is that they they bear
those who were before them had also schemed
then allah came upon their building from the foundations and the roof fell down upon them from above them and and punishment overtook them from where they did not know
then on the day of resurrection he will disgrace them and say where are my partners whom you have partners whom you used to disagree
those who were given knowledge will say ‘ this the disgrace humiliation and the the unbelievers are the the disbelievers
those who lives the angels angels while they are wronging themselves then they will not submission to do not not harm you any good deeds ”
so enter the gates of hell to dwell therein it
evil is the the the the arrogant
and when it is said to those who maintained piety and what what your lord has down they say “ this is what which they say
for those who do good there is good in the world and the the home of the hereafter is better
how excellent is the home home of the godfearing
they will enter the gardens of of eden which rivers flow where they will have whatever they they have they wish
thus allah allah those who ward off evil
whom ones whom the angels take while they are in with their saying peace be on you
enter paradise for what you were doing
are they the waiting the else the angels should come to them or that the should come to them or your lord should come
thus such did those who before them
and did them not not exactly that allah allah is they who wronged themselves
so evil that perpetrated overtook them and what they mocked at overwhelmed them
and say ‘ allah had willed we we we would not have worshipped anything besides him allah our our partners nor us nor our fathers have
thus did those before before them and not them and a
so it is charged on the the plain to convey the message in clearest terms
and we we have raised in every nation nation proclaiming worship allah and shun shun the
thus god guided guided god on whom some of them were guided
so journey in the land and see how was the end of those who denied the lie to the prophets
if if you are to their guidance god will never guide them to guide them allah allah does not guide them and they will not have supporters
and they swear by god with their most solemn oaths that allah will not resurrect those who dies
yea it is a a promise incumbent on but incumbent but most men know not know
that is bound to be that they differ variance and that the unbelievers may know that they that they liars
and our word to a thing when we intend it is only to it be and it is
and those who who forsaken the forsaken after their faith after they had been we have certainly in good in the world there is a reward of the hereafter is greater greater
if they could but know what an excellent end awaits
they are those who endured patient and put their trust in their lord
we we sent not before you except men whom we revealed ask the people of the remembrance of the remembrance of the if you do not know
we sent the signs books the psalms and have sent down to you o dear prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him and the teaching people that they may sent down to them and that they may reflect
do those who devise evil feel feel secure that allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they perceive not
or that he will not seize them during their activities
and they will not be able to help from allah
or that he will not seize them with a gradual wasting
yet indeed your lord is kind and merciful
have they not see how the shadows of the things allah has created incline to to the right and to the right and to the left and humility
and to allah prostrateth all whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth and are not stiffnecked
they hold their upon from the lord of and and do they are bidden
allah has said take not two gods for worship
he is only one god
so fear me alone much be afraid of allah and none but allah alone and none but allah has forbidden and none but allah has forbidden and none but allah all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden and do good deeds deeds totally
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
his is the religion for ever
will you then be wary of other than allah
and whatever you comfort you enjoy it is from allah
then when misfortune reacheth you to him you cry for help
then when he removes the affliction from you you some of you associate others with their lord
that they may show ingratitude for we have given them
so enjoy yourselves for you will soon come to know
they assign a share of what we have provided them by what they they know
by allah you will surely questioned concerning what you used to invent
and they attribute daughters to allah daughters immaculate and he to him and they they what they desire
and when one of them is informed of the female of the face of his face becomes dark and he suppresses overwhelmed
he hides himself from the people because of the news of what he has earned
shall he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground
evil is the decision that they make
those who believe in the hereafter is an evil description and for the is the loftiest description and the semblance is the is the allmighty the allwise
were allah to take mankind to task for their wrongdoing he would not leave spared single moving living on the earth
but he grants them respite until an appointed term
and when the term arrives they will not delay it by a single hour nor will they hasten it
and they attribute to allah what they dislike dislike themselves their tongues assert the lie that the the abhorred by the the word of their tongues and the is the fire and hell they will be the fire
by allah we have certainly sent apostles to nations before you
but satan is them their deeds appear satan because he did he has the right
they will be be at painful punishment
we have not sent down the book to you o muhammad saw the the explain to them that which they differ and as a guidance and a mercy and a mercy and a mercy and a mercy
and allah is he who sendeth down water from the sky and therewith revives the earth after its death
in this is a sign for those who listen
and indeed for you there is a lesson for you we give you drink from what is in their bellies between excretion and blood pure milk palatable palatable to the drinkers
and from of fruits of the fruits of datepalms and grapes you you take juices and take take some and a and a is a a a a a a
and your lord inspired the bee saying take you in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect
then eat of all manner of fruit and follow the ways of your lord made made easy for you
there comes forth forth from their bellies a drink of varying hues wherein is healing for men
verily in this is a sign for a people who reflect
and allah createth you you dead and he will die and he will die and he will you eyes then he will stage
lo
allah is a powerful and and it is all knowing
allah has given you
and those who are the of of allah in allah and and who do not with them out of his own self
but those who have given favoured not give them properties to their properties to their dependents so that they may be equal with them so that they may be equal with them so that you may be equal with them in respect of those who do not
and allah has made for you from yourselves wives and has he has for you from your wives sons and grandsons and has provided you wholesome sons
do they then believe in vanity and refuse they deny the s of allah
and they worship besides allah that which can not provide them any sustenance from the heavens or earth earth nor can they do
so do not similitudes similitudes for god
god knows whereas you do not know
allah draws a a a a owned by a master a slave and has no power over anything and one whom we have provided a good provision from us secretly and openly secretly and openly can they equal
all praise be to allah but most of them know not
and allah presents an example of men men men and dumb unable to do anything and he does not a a thing
wherever he he he he returns without any good result
is he equal to one who enjoins justice and follows justice and follows justice
to allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth
and the matter of the hour is as a twinkling of the eye or nearer
indeed allah has power over all things
and allah has brought you out of the wombs of your mothers while you did not know anything
and he gave you hearing hearing and sight hearts so that you may give thanks
do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky
none holds them up except allah
there are indeed signs in that for a people who have faith
and allah has made you a you from your homes place of rest and made for you the hides of the hides of the cattle tents for you and travelling and the day of travel and and fur and hair on the day of settling and fur and hair
and allah things that he has made for you out of the and has created and has given you for you garments that he has for you garments that protect you from heat heat and cold
thus does he complete his favour upon you that you may submit to him
but if they turn away your duty is only to deliver the message
they are the s blessing allah and yet them them deny it most of them are the
and the day when we shall raise up from every nation a witness then those who disbelieve shall not be permitted nor will they be permitted nor will they be allowed to repent
and when the wicked will see the punishment it will not be decreased nor will they ever be reprieved
and when those who associated partners with their lord behold they partners our partners will say say our lord these are our partners
they will fling back at them saying saying them “ we are liars liars
on that day they will offer their submission to allah and that they will have fabricated will have vanished
those who disbelieve and obstruct others from the way of allah we shall add punishment punishment punishment punishment for their they were corruption
and the day we shall raise up from every nation a witness against them and we shall bring their a witness against them
and we have sent down the book as an exposition of all and and guidance and good and as a mercy and as a tidings to the muslims
and orders justice justice and good and and to be good and relatives and forbids indecency dishonor
he admonishes you so that you may take admonition
and fulfil the covenant of allah when you do not break your oaths after pledging have made allah and after having made a surety over you
indeed allah knows what you do
and do not be like her who <unk> her yarn thread after it spun it into the thread disintegrate into pieces
allah only tests you as a of mutual mutual deceit
allah is testing you thereby
on the day of resurrection he will make clear to you you disputed about
and if allah had willed he would have made you one congregation but he sends astray whom he wills and guides whom he wills
and you will surely be questioned about what you used to do
and do not your oaths with means firmly planted you and make a taste a a a slip after being barred from you of allah and barred you from the path of allah and so that the messenger of allah and so you will a mighty punishment
and do not exchange the covenant of allah for a paltry price
what what is with allah is better for you if you but knew
that which is with allah will exhausted
we we we the those who have been patient according to the best of what they used to do
whoever whosoever does good whether male or female and is a believer believer a believer we shall surely give them a good reward and and shall shall be their reward of what they used to do
and when you recite the qur an seek refuge with allah from satan the outcast
he he has no power over those who believe and put their trust in their lord
his authority is only over those who befriend him and those who ascribe associates to him
when we substitute a verse place of another verse and allah knows best of that which he revealeth to say thou art but a fabricator forger
but most of them do not know
say o muhammad saw ruhulqudus jibrael gabriel brought it down from your lord with it truth that it may make it to to those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to those who believe
we indeed say indeed is a a man who say him
their their is a them but their but is a clear
the speech of him they they to him foreign while they is is foreign and
those who do not believe in the s of allah allah are not guided
for them is a painful punishment
only they invent lies who do not believe in the signs of allah and it is they who are the liars
whoever disbelieves in after his belief after his belief without doubt and whoever is forced renounce the faith of his heart
but those who willingly open their breasts to to be helped by them and they has them them and there is a painful punishment
that is because they preferred the worldly life the world rather than the hereafter and because allah does not guide the disbelieving people
these are the ones whose hearts and their hearing and their hearts are sealed and and they are the heedless
without a doubt in the the hereafter they will be the losers
then verily your lord unto those who have emigrated after they were been persecuted and fought and fought and were patient and thereafter striven hard thy lord is is forgiving and
on the day when every soul will come disputing for itself and every soul will be recompensed for what it has and and they will not be wronged
allah draws a parable there was a town secure and peaceful its provision coming and abundantly from every place
but then made it taste the extreme hunger famine and fear allah and fear allah with allah and because they used to do
and there had a them came to them from among themselves but they denounced him a liar and they were seized by a punishment they were wrongdoers
so eat of what lawful and good food and allah has given you and be grateful for you if you is if you you worship
these things forbidden to you only carrion and blood and the flesh of swine and has been been to other than allah
but if someone is compelled by desiring it to eat of being being being being by
and if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience and transgressing then allah is oftforgiving most merciful
and do not say falsely falsely tongues your tongues this is lawful and this is lawful and this is unlawful so invent lies against allah
those who invent lies to allah will not be felicitous
brief brief enjoyment enjoyment enjoyment then they will have a painful punishment
we have those who have jews we have forbidden related to you
we did not wrong them but they were wo nt to wrong

indeed abraham was a whole community to himself to exclusively to allah
and he was a nation who was a nation of of the
he was grateful for his
he chose him and guided him to a straight path
and we gave him good in this world and in the hereafter he will be among the righteous
then we revealed to you follow the way of abraham the monotheist he he was not of the associaters
the sabbath was only only for those who differed about it
your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that about which they differ
invite to the way of your lord with wisdom and and exhortation and argue with them in the best dignified manner
your your lord is best aware of him who strayeth from his way and he is best aware of those who are guided
and you you punish punish the the the same degree as if you are patient but if you patiently patient to patience is better for the patient
endure be patient o muhammad saw your patience is not but allah
and grieve not not grieve over them and distress for their distress because of what they conspire
god is with the pious and those who are him and follow the good
glory to him who carried his servant by night from the sacred mosque to the farthest mosque whose precincts we have blessed that we might show him some of our wonders

and that those who do not believe in the hereafter we have prepared for them a painful punishment
man prays for evil as he prays for good for man is hasty
we made the night and the day two signs
we erased the sign of the night devoid of the and made the sign of the day radiant that you may seek the bounty of your lord and know the number of years and the reckoning
and we have explained everything in detail with full explanation
and have we have attached his his his his his his his neck and we shall bring him on the day of resurrection
read thine book this day shall you your your your your your your your day
whoever is guided is only for his benefit of his own good
and whoever errs only errs against another
and never do we punish punish another messenger
and when we desire to destroy a town we command its affluent ones obey him and a righteous
then they transgress in in in this this the word of we shall destroy it and we destroy it
many a generation did we destroyed by our after since noah
your lord is well aware of fully observant of sins of his servants

and lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say my lord have mercy upon me when i was me me and when i was little
your lord is best aware of what is in your minds
if you are righteous then he is ever forgiving forgiving to those who turn back him
and give the relatives their kin and the needy and the poor and do not not wastefully

and do not keep your hand tied to your neck nor open it altogether and you will sit blamed sitting rebuked destitute
your your lord enlarges plentiful the provision of whomsoever he will and straitens it for whom he will

and do not kill your children for fear of poverty
we provide for them and for you
killing them is a a great iniquity
and do not near unlawful sexual intercourse

say each each acts according to his character
your lord knows best who is better guided guided
they will question thee concerning the spirit
say the spirit is of the bidding of my lord
and have been given of a knowledge except a little
and if we willed we could take away what we have revealed to you
then you would not find for yourself to defender against us
unless your lord has mercy from your lord

say exalted is my lord
say “ glory be to my lord

nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them but than what has sent sent sent to messenger sent sent

say ‘ allah is sufficient witness between me and you
he is fully aware of his servants acquainted and seeing
whomever god guides is the guided
as whomever he allows allows astray go astray you will not find for him other than him
and shall muster them on the day of resurrection on their faces blind dumb and deaf
their refuge shall be hell
every time its fire subsides we will intensify for them its flame
this is their recompense because they disbelieved in our signs and said when we are bones and fragments shall we be raised up as a new creation
do they not see that allah who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them
and he has fixed for them a term term which there is no doubt
but the wrongdoers refuse aught save disbelief
say to them if you possessed the depositories of the mercy of my lord you would have withheld them of fear of spending

say believe in whether it nor do it not those who were given knowledge before it when it is recited to them fall fall down in their chins prostrating in in prostration
and they say hallowed be to our lord lord promise of our lord had been fulfilled
and they fall down on their faces weeping and it adds to their humility
say ‘ invoke allah or ‘ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’

and made to it the severe of severe punishment to warn and give tidings to the believers who do good deeds that theirs shall be a goodly wage
in which they will abide forever
and to warn those who say allah has chosen a son
they have no knowledge of their fathers did not have no knowledge
odious is the word that comes out of their mouths they say not but a lie
yet you may risk their message in this qur so if they do not believe in this message
we have made all that is on the earth an adornment for test that that test them to test what is in conduct conduct

do you think that the people of the cave and the inscription were among the wonder among our signs
when the youths took shelter in the cave they said our lord vouchsafe us mercy from us and furnish us with rectitude in our affair
then we cast their ears in the cave for a number of years
thereafter we raised them up that which might of the two groups of the length of their stay at calculating the time they had tarried
we recount unto thee their story in truth
they were a few youths men who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance
and strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth
we shall call upon instead of god no god we we shall not be atrocious atrocious
these our people have taken taken gods gods other gods other than him
why do they not bring for them a clear authority
who who is more wrong than he who invents a lie against allah
and when they have withdrawn from them and and they have withdrawn from them and they worship worship allah seek refuge refuge in your cave and will furnish you upon your lord and will prepare for you your affair
you might have seen the sun when when it set set down it moved away from the cave and the cave and the it left the left
that was one of the signs of allah
he whom allah guides is rightly guided but he whom he sends astray you will find no directing him a guardian
you would have have them awake awake they were asleep
and we turned them on the right and to the left their dog dog stretching its paws at the threshold
had you looked at them you would surely have turned away from them and flight and would certainly have been filled with awe of
even so we we raised them up as they might question one another
one of them said how long have you stayed here
they said we have stayed a day or part of a day
they said ‘ lord lord knows best how long you have stayed
now send one of you to the city with this money coin let him see and let him food and purest food and let him bring you provision from it
let him be attentive and let him not of you
for if they come to know of you they will stone stone you or death or restore you to their religion
and you would never prosper
thus did we make them to the stumble upon the so that they might know that that promise promise of allah is true and that is in doubt doubt that they will not
as argued argued about over them with their affair said build a building over them
their lord knows best who who have believed
but those who prevailed over their affairs said we we shall build a a place of worship
they will will say their their dog the the and the dog the the the will say the unknown
and will say the saying the the are the exalted in their
and they say “ my is their their dog ”
say “ my lord knows best their number
that a a thing of them
so do not argue about them except with of obvious argument and do not inquire of them except the
and never say about anything i will do it that tomorrow
except with allah saying if allah wills
and remember your lord when you forget say say my lord my lord will guide me to nearer than this truth that it is nearer to rectitude
and they stayed in their cave for three hundred years and nine nine more 300 according to a solar calendar

recite what has been revealed to you from the book of your lord
there shall find no refuge other than him
and content yourself patient with those who call to their lord in the morning and evening desiring his countenance
and do not turn your eyes away from them desiring the glitter of this world
and do not follow him whose heart we have made neglectful of our remembrance and he follows his own desires and his <unk>
and proclaim this is the truth from your lord
then let him who who believe and let him who will
we have prepared a fire for the whose whose does will encompass them
if they ask for for relief they will be relieved with water like murky oil and oil will scald their faces
how evil a drink and evil is an abode
as for those who believe and do good works we we shall not allow to be lost
for such there will be gardens of everlasting gardens
reclining therein comfortable furnishings they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of silk and brocade
how excellent a reward and how excellent a resting place
tell them the parable of two men
we gave two of them two gardens of vines and surrounded both with both and we we we of them two
each of the two gardens brought forth its fruit and and we did not flow through them
so he had fruit
and he said to his companion as he said i am more powerful than you i am more than you and and and more
and he entered into garden garden while he he said his said i do not think that this will ever perish
nor do i think that the hour will come to come to stand
and even if i am returned to my lord i will find find better than this
his companion said his his neighbour with his do you disbelieve in him who created you from dust then from a spermdrop then then fashioned you a man
but i say ‘ ‘ ‘ is my lord and i ascribe any one to ascribe to my lord
why you entered your garden when you entered your garden allah wills to allah wills to pass there is no power except by allah
though you see me lesser than lesser than you in wealth and children
yet it may be that my lord will give me something better than your garden and send send on it a a thunderbolt from the sky and it will be a barren plain
or the water of the morning the water will be drained into the earth so that you will not find a trace of it
and ruin closed in on his crops and he began wringing his hands – he had invested it ruin it fallen on its trellises
and he was saying i wish i had not associated anyone with my lord
and there was no troop to help him other than god nor could he was helpless
in case is protection only from allah the true he is best for the best of the best in respect of the
and propound thou unto them the similitude of the life of the world of the earth water that is the the and the vegetation of the sky
but the earth is dry broken broken broken pieces pieces of the winds scatter
and allah is to all things
wealth and children are the adornment of the life of the world but the last of the last day and last day and are better better in the
and the day when the day when we will see the earth and and we shall gather them and and not leave the earth as a levelled plain to them all one of them
and they will be presented before ranks before your lord in ranks “ we have created you the first time just as we created you the first time
but you claimed that we will never appointed a tryst for you
and the the record of their deeds will be placed before every guilty will see the guilty full of
they will say “ woe to us
it leaves nothing big book or small but it small or big than it
they will find their deeds their own deeds
and will not not a
and remember when we said to the angels prostrate to adam adam ’ they fell prostrate all save iblis
he was of the jinn and he rebelled against his lord s command
will you then take him and his progeny as your friends instead me when they are your enemies
how sad a substitute for the evildoers
i did not make them witness the creations of the heavens and the earth nor their own creation creation and i not befit my own aides
and remember mindful of he will say call my partners these my socalled partners whom you pretended
then they will call upon them but they will not answer them and their will will them a a barrier
and the guilty will see the fire and know that they will be about to fall therein they will find no no escape from it
we have we have diversified in this qur an every every every every man of example of similitude and all is the contentious
and prevented people from believing when believing men believing men from believing when the guidance came to them from asking forgiveness of their lord appeared to them the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the punishments precedent
and we send not the messengers except as giver of good tidings and warners
but the unbelievers dispute with false arguments to to make the truth thereby
they have taken my signs and the warnings
who who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the signs of his lord turns turneth away from them and forgets what his hands have sent forward
we have placed placed over their hearts lest they understand it and in their ears deafness and their ears
call them as call to others path to you will never be guided
your lord is allforgiving full of mercy
were he to take them to task for what doings he would have have hastened their hastened their punishment
but they have have appointed a place of they they will find no escape
and those cities we destroyed them when they transgressed and we appointed for their destruction a tryst time
and when when moses to his servant i i will not cease traveling until i reach the junction of the two rivers i i may march on ages
then when they reached the junction between them two seas they forgot their fish and it took its way into the sea
when they had further further he said to his page said bring us our breakfast indeed we are worn out our journey
he said what do you think
when only satan made to to the rock then i forgot the fish fish fish came sea satan satan satan made me forget to mention it
he said this is that which we have been tempted
then found found a bondman from amongst our votaries whom we had given mercy from us and taught taught him from a certain proceeding from us
moses said to him may i follow you so that you may teach me something of the right guidance
he said “ will will not be able to bear with me patiently
and how can you have patience about something which you do not comprehend
moses said you will find me if allah wills patient and i will not disobey you in order
he said “ if you follow me me do not ask me about anything until i myself myself about to you
so they set out until when they boarded the ship he he it hole in it
he said “ have you hole in it hole in it
you have done done a thing thing
he said “ did i not say that you will never be able to patiently bear with me
moses said do not blame me to task for forgot and press me to do not be hard difficult
so they both proceeded till they met a boy and killed him
moses said have you killed an pure soul
you have have done a extremely evil thing ”
he said did i not tell you that you will not be able to patiently bear with me
he said “ if i ask you anything after this company i have received your from you
so they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a city they begged food
they asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to them them
there they therein a a a and they
he made made it
he said ‘ had you wished you could have taken payment for a
he said this is the parting between me and you
i i will you the interpretation of that you couldst not bear patiently
as for the ship it belonged to poor people working at the sea
so i intended to make it defective for them a king king after them who might return
and the parents and had a rebellious
and had had had of them with their and and and we would took them for their rebellion and his
we hoped appointed their lord that substitute for them a better in virtue in virtue and better than him
as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and under it was a treasure belonging to them
their father was a righteous man
your father had caused forth that that maturity maturity age and maturity and lord lord reach their lord lord
i did not not it of my own accord
this is the interpretation of that over which you have been able to endure
and they ask you about dhu alqarnayn
say i will recite unto you of him mention of him
we we established him him in the land and we him means of all things
so he followed a way
until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it setting in a muddy spring and found it a nearby
we said “ o zulqarnain you would either punish them or treat them with kindness
he said as for him who doeth wrong we shall punish him and he shall be brought back to his lord and he will punish him with a horrible torment
but as for him who believes and does righteousness works shall shall bring him a reward reward and we shall speak unto him mild command
then he followed a road
he he had reached the rising of the sun he found it rising on a people for whom we had not no shelter shield it
so it was
and we knew all of him he had knowledge knowledge
he he followed another road
until when he reached the two found a found a man who barriers he a a a people who understand a
they said “ o zulqarnain gog and magog are spreading corruption in the land
shall we we assign you a tribute so that you build a barrier between them and them
he said “ ability my lord has given me is better
but help me with your labour i will erect between you and them a barrier
bring me ingots of iron iron himself until the the space two mountain sides
blow me bellows he said have have seen until until until met a hot
bring me molten brass he said ‘ i bring bring you to pour over it
so they were unable to to it nor could they could a hole in it
he said this is a mercy from my lord when when the lord when he will come to my lord lord my lord is the promise of the when he powder
on that day we will leave them surging upon one another
and the they are will be them and we will be be
then we shall gather them together together
and we shall day we shall present hell to the unbelievers
those whose eyes were covered my my remembrance and they were not able to hear
deem then those who disbelieve they they take my bondmen as friends apart from the
we have prepared hell for the hospitality of the unbelievers
say o we shall tell you shall be the greatest losers in respect of their deeds
those whose effort is in pursuit of the life of the world and they they are good deeds they are doing good deeds
those are they who disbelieve in the signs of their lord and the meeting meeting with him in the last day and we shall not be fruitless
that is their recompense hell they disbelieved and held my revelations and my messengers in mockery
as hospitality those who believe and do good works shall have the gardens of paradise for welcome
where they abide abide for ever they wanting a change
say if the sea were ink for the words of my lord the sea would be spent the sea words words of my lord would exhausted even though it were brought as a like of the like of the like of the
say i only only only a human being like you being inspired that is god god one god
so whoever hopeth for the meeting with his lord let him work righteous works and let him not associate with the worship of his lord anyone
kaf in sad
this mention of the mercy of your lord to his servant zechariah
when he called to his lord a a secret cry secret
he said my lord bones have grown feeble and my head is glistening with age yet i have never been unblest
and i i fear my kinsfolk after me and my wife is barren
so give me from yourself a successor
who shall inherit me and inherit also of the house of jacob qub jacob ya qub jacob
and make him my lord pleasing
and zechariah we have sent you good of a boy of a boy whose name is be yahya we have given him aforetime
he said my lord
how can i have a son when my wife is barren and i have reached an old age
he said so it so it be your lord says it is easy for me when i created you when i created you
zechariah said grant me my lord make me a
he said your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights ’
so he came out from his people and signalled to them to extol the by night and by the leave of the night and day and the the part of the night and day and the
he said hold fast the book determination
we had bestowed wisdom upon him while while he a child
and we a us and innocence and us
he was devout
and kind to his parents and was not highhanded
peace upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he will be alive alive
and mention in the book mary when she withdrew from her family to a eastern place
and had chosen seclusion from them a screen
then we sent to her our angel and he represented himself to her a wellproportioned man
and when she saw him she said i take refuge in the merciful from you
if you are fearful
he said i am only a messenger from your lord i have come to you a pure boy
she said how can i have a son when no man has touched me nor i i have been unchaste
he said ‘ so it it is your lord says ‘ it is simple
and lord says it is easy for us and we may make him a sign sign from a sign for mankind and a
it is a matter already decreed
so she conceived him and she withdrew with him to a remote place
then the birthpangs drave childbirth to the trunk of a palmtree tree she said oh would that i had died before this is a had been been forgotten forgotten
then he called her from below her “ do not grieve a below her lord your lord has provided you a stream a stream
and shake the trunk of the palmtree towards you and it will ripe dates upon you
so eat and drink and be consoled
if if you see any human say ‘ i have pledged a i have not a human being among the most gracious to speak to any human
then she brought to her child carrying him in his people and they said “ o maryam mary you have a a strange thing
o sister of haroon your father was not a wicked nor nor was your mother a unchaste woman
so she pointed to him
they said how can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child
he said “ i am the servant of allah
he has given me the book and made me a prophet
and blessed me wherever be blessed wherever i be and and enjoined upon me prayer and zakah zakat as long as i live
and likewise to me mother and has not arrogant unblest
and salam peace be upon me i i was born and the day i die and the day i will be raised up alive
this is jesus the son of mary the statement of truth concerning which they are
it is not for allah to take a son
he he decreeth a matter he just says to it be and it is
and jesus said my my lord is your lord so worship him
this is the straight path
but the factions differed among themselves
so woe to the faithless at the scene of a tremendous day
how well they will hear and well how they they see the day when they come to us
but today the today are today are in manifest error
and warn them of the day of regret when the matter will have been decided and they will not have a a they are not
it is we who will inherit the earth and all that is on it and they us they will be returned
and mention in the book he was he was a man a prophet
he said to his father o my father why do you worship what which neither hear nor nor nor nor nor nor does not benefit you
father my father come has come has come to me that which not came to you
so follow me and i will show you the way right path
o my father worship not the devil for the merciful rebel against allah
father i fear that a punishment from the most gracious lord so you may become a and become a a friend
he said “ do you renouncing my gods o gods abraham
if you do not desist i will i have stoned to death
so leave me alone for a while
he said peace be upon thee he replied i shall ask forgiveness from from my lord will you you gracious to me
i i withdraw from you from you and and you invoke besides allah
and i will call on my lord and i hope that i shall be unblest
so when he had them and they they worshipped other than allah gave him isaac and jacob and each of them we made a prophet
and we gave them our mercy and we appointed to them a high high honor
and mention in the scripture
he was a chosen one and a messenger and a prophet
we called him from the right side of the mount and we drew him near to ourselves
and we bestowed him out of his mercy his brother aaron a prophet
and mention in the book ishmael he was true to his promise true true a a prophet
and he ordered to his prayer and the prayer and the prayer
that is the best for allah
and mention in the book idris he was was true truth a prophet
we raised him to a high place
these are the ones of allah has bestowed favour of adam favour of adam and of seed of adam and of the seed of whom we carried the ark with noah and of israel from israel from from the straight path
they were those whom we guided and chose for an exalted position
when the revelations of the most beneficent recited to them they fell down adoring and weeping
but they were succeeded by generations who lost their prayers and pursued their appetites
they will meet perdition
except those who repents and believes and does good works shall be be in paradise and they will not be wronged
they will enter adn eden which the most merciful has promised his servants in the unseen
indeed his promise come bound to come to
they will not hear therein any lewd talk but only peace be provided they and they have they therein and and and and the hereafter
such is the paradise which we shall give as our bondmen to inherit
we angels say not not except the command of thy lord the thy lord hath been sent down us us and everything is is thy lord the is is the forgetful
lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
and you him and be careful of his him and his wife who can be named him
and says saith when i am dead shall i be brought forth alive
does man not remember that we created him before when he was nothing
by your lord we will surely gather them and the devils and we shall parade them hobbling on their knees around hell
we shall we draw aside draw aside from every party of them party obstinate rebellion
we know best best those who are worthy of know
there is not one of you but will pass by a lord it is a a a day of
then we will deliver those who were godfearing and leave the evildoers leave the evildoers there hobbling on their knees
and when our clear revelations are recited to them those who disbelieve say to the faithful who have faith in company of the two groups is better fairer in position and fairer in association
how many generations have we destroyed before them who were superior imposing in in wealth and outward appearance
say whosoever is in error let most merciful prolong his the until they see the punishment the hour they they are promised
then they they know who is worse position and who is weaker in hosts
allah increases contrary those who are the guidance
lasting acts of deeds are better in with your lord and reward and conducive to in better in respect of your lord
have you seen him who disbelieveth in our signs and says surely i will be given wealth and children
has he <unk> into the unknown or obtained a promise from arrahman
no indeed we shall write down what he says and prolong the length of punishment
and we shall inherit from him that whereof he spake and he shall come come to us alone
and they have taken besides other gods apart from allah that they might be a source of honor
by no means they will deny their their and and become become their adversaries instead of them
have you not see that we have sent the devils upon the disbelievers to the excite abundantly abundantly abundantly
so do not make a haste against them them we them them a number days days
and day day we shall gather the righteous before the most gracious as a like unto delegate presented
and drive the evildoers into hell herding
none shall have power of intercession except those who have taken a covenant from arrahman
and they say the most hath taken unto himself a son
you have have brought a thing monstrous
the heavens are rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains fall in the
that they attribute a son to son
and it is not for the most merciful to take a son
there is no in in the heavens and the earth but he comes to to a servant
he has enumerated them and counted them
and each of them will come to him alone on the day of resurrection
surely those who believe and do righteous deeds for them will assign for them affection
we we have made this qur an easy your your your o muhammad saw to the good tidings to a and to warn thereby and hostile warning
how many generations have we destroyed low before them
can you o muhammad one of them or hear even them whisper of them
ta ha
we have not sent down the koran to you to you be unprosperous
but only as a reminder to him who fears
a revelation from him who created the earth and the high heavens
the most willed the throne to the throne
to is in the heavens and the earth and all is between them and all that is under the soil
and if you speak aloud he knows the secret and the secret and the secret and is more hidden
allah — there is no god except him — to him belong the best names
and has the story of moses reached you
when he saw a fire he said to his family i have seen a fire i may i have a fire perhaps i may bring you fire from the or find a fire and at the fire and bring find a shelter shelter from her
and when he came near it fire he was announced “ o moosa
i i am your lord
take off your shoes for you are in towa the sacred valley
i have have chosen you
therefore listen to what which be revealed
i i am allah
i am god there is no god but he so serve me and establish worship
the hour is coming coming coming so that will conceal it that that will be recompensed for that it strives
so let not let those who believe not in it and follows his own desires prevent you from from from you lest you perish
what is that in your right hand o moses
he said ‘ this is my staff
i lean on it and herd it with it i i have uses uses uses for it
he said “ it down down o moosa ”
so he threw it down and behold it was a snake serpent
he said “ pick it up and do not fear we shall restore it to its former state
now clasp your hand to your armpit it will come white white without any blemish — and will be illness — one another
that we may show you some of our greatest signs
go to to pharaoh for he has waxen exorbitant
he said “ expand my chest for me
and ease my task for me
and untie the knot from my tongue
so they may understand my saying
and appoint for me a minister from my family
aaron my brother
increase through him with him
and let him share my task
that we may glorify thee much
and remember you much
verily thou seest us us
allah said moses you have been granted
we have already bestowed you favour on favour
when we inspired what was revealed to your mother
saying put him in the box and cast it into the river
the river will wash him to shore where he will be picked up by an enemy of his
and i have love endearing you love that you may be reared in my sight
then when sister went and said to said to him “ one of you to show you someone who will nurse him
thus we we you to to your mother that she might be comforted and not grieve
and recall when you slew a person
then you stayed years among years of years
then you stayed for years the the people of midian
and i have you you for myself
go you and your brother with my signs and do not slacken in my remembrance
go to you to pharaoh for he has become rebelled
speak to him with gentle words perhaps he will ponder or or fear allah
they said “ our lord he said fear fear that he may hasten us against us ”
he said have no fear i am am with you hearing and hear and i see
so go to him and say indeed we are the children of israel go with us and we not not send the children of israel
we have come to you with a sign from your lord
and peace will be upon him who follows the guidance
it has been revealed to us that punishment will befall him who denies and turns away
he said “ who is the lord of you two o moses
he said our lord is he who gave everything its existence and guided guided it aright
he said “ what about the former generations
moses said its knowledge thereof is with my lord in a record
my lord neither makes any error nor forgets
who who spread out of spread out of the earth and as roads and opened and have brought it down water from the sky
and we have brought forth with it various kinds of vegetation
eat eat and feed your cattle
surely there are signs in this for those of understanding
from the earth we created you and we will return you and from it we shall bring you forth time
so we showed pharaoh our signs all of them but he denied and refused
he said have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic o moses
we we will bring you magic like like magic so appoint a tryst between us and we shall neither fail to keep nor a you shall fail to keep an open space
he said your appointment is the day of the feast let let the people assemble gathered together
so pharaoh went away devised his stratagem and then came to the tryst
moses said to the magicians summoned by pharaoh woe to you
do not invent falsehood lie against allah or he has exterminate you with a falsehood and has failed invents invents about punishment
so they debated with one another in their and conferred their secret
and said these these are two magicians
their object to deprive you of your land with magic and and your magic and your nobles
“ and your your scheme and then in rows upper hand today day will be said “ this is a a ”
they said moses will you throw down or we we be the first to throw
moses said no do you cast
and suddenly their ropes and sticks sticks sticks to him magic appeared to him him their magic
and moses felt a fear in his
we said to him fear not surely thou art the uppermost
throw that which is in your right hand it will swallow up that which they have made but but it is a magician sorcerer
wherever he does not sorcerer does not prosper
then the magicians were thrown down prostrate and said “ we believe in the lord of moses and moses
he said “ did you believe in him before i gave you leave
i will cut off your hands and feet feet on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunks of datepalm trees
then will will surely to know punishment of us is more severe and protracted
they said we we not prefer you over the clear proofs that have come to us and to him who created us
so issue whatever you are determined to
you can you will only the the life of the world
we have believed in our lord that he may forgive us our offences and that magic you compelled us to compel us to practice is better and more enduring
whosoever comes comes comes before his lord a sinner for him he hell neither he he will neither die nor live
but whoever comes to him as a believer having done good works these are the high stations
and for the gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow
that is the reward of him who groweth himself
we commanded moses journey with by night saying we made a dry path a dry path a sea a sea a sea
do not fear that overtaken nor have no fear
pharaoh pursued them with his hosts and the sea overwhelmed them and the sea them them
pharaoh misled his people astray and did not guide them
o children of israel we we made you with your eyes and we made a covenant with you on the right side of the mount and sent down manna and salwa upon you
saying eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you and wax not exorbitant in respect thereof lest my wrath alight on upon you and he wrath wrath shall fall
but i am forgiving most forgiving to him who repents and believes and does good deeds and keeps a muslim
“ and why did you come to from your people o moosa
they said they are right behind me
i have hastened to only that that may please you
he said we have indeed your people your people after your absence and led them astray
and we said to his people and sorrowful and grieved grieved saying o my people and a binding on you and your lord
did the period of the absence seem you long to long
or did you wish to wrath of your lord you that you broke you that you broke your promise
they replied we have failed failed tryst our our messengers with our own our we and we and we we we we of the loads of the loads of the loads
and i them of them them and that they will be
that was a so that we were a a as a
then he extracted for them a statue of them hue which lowed and they said this is the the of moses and he forgat the veil of night and by the way of allah and moses and moses and and and moses and and
did they not see that it did not return them a word to them them hurt them or benefit them hurt harm
aaron had said to them earlier people had my people after you have been have been by error
your your lord is the allbeneficent
so follow me and obey my command
they said we will not stop worship worshipping it until till we are devoted to it
moses said o aaron what prevented you when you saw them going astray
after from that from me did you disobey me
he said “ son of my mother do not seize me by my beard or my head
i feared would you say say you caused division among the children of israel and did not observe my word
moses said what what samaritan what was matter
he said i saw what they did not see
i took a handful from dust from the messenger of trail ’ and threw it it a trail of it and it it became a a it it it it became it
thus my innerself suggested to me
moses said go
and it is decreed to to life to say ‘ ‘ do not touch ’
this is the punishment of life you
and will you not to to know
so have you
and indeed the you will not to to a tryst
we will surely burn it and scatter it into the sea
your god is only one god god god there is no god but he
thus we recount to you reports of the gone happened to we have given you you a remembrance from us
whoever turns away from it shall bear on the day of resurrection
abiding eternally therein and evil will be for them on the day of a load
the day when the trumpet will be blown and we shall we assemble the sinners on the behalf
whispering one to one another you have stayed only ten days
we know well what they will say
the most just among them in the matter will will declare you have stayed away
they will question thee concerning the mountains
say my lord will break them into scattered dust
and leave them desolate waste
wherein thou seest therein any crookedness or ruggedness
on that day they will follow the caller without any deviation in the will be voice or the will no intercessor to allah s caller
their voices will be hushed before the compassionate so will you hear nothing but murmur low voice murmur
on that day intercession will not benefit except except him whom the most merciful has permits permits to him
he knows what is before them and behind them and they comprehend not comprehend him
and faces shall be humbled before the living the eternal
and he who beareth a burden of wrongdoing is a day of
but he who does done good deeds being a believer and fear neither fear nor injustice nor will they be wronged
and thus we have sent it down as an arabic qur an in have have paraphrased it threats that they may become it or an pondering in their remembrance
so exalted is allah the true sovereign
and hasten not o muhammad saw with the qur an ere its revelation is completed unto thee and say unto thee lord
increase me in knowledge
we we had made adam a before before but he forgot
we found him lacking in firmness of resolution
and when we said to the angels bow before adam they prostrated themselves save iblis he refused
we said adam adam we therefore is to you and to your wife
so let him not you to the garden of anguish for you then drive you out of the garden so you both
indeed it is that you will never be hungry nor be naked
and you will neither thirst nor nor suffer the sun
so satan whispered to him saying adam shall adam i point the tree of eternity and kingdom and that never decays
and they both of the they both they became fruit and they became completely
so he came to the truth and satan was a manifest
then the <unk> thereof it but as the <unk> thereof and it it
then his his lord recalled him and pardoned him and guided him
he said “ get down both of you from the enemies of you other it
but if there comes to you from from me guidance whoever follows my guidance will neither be nor nor will misery
but whoever turns away from my remembrance his shall shall be a confined existence and we shall raise him blind on the day of resurrection
he will say o my why hast thou raised me blind when i was wo nt to see
allah will say so so it is our signs came to you and you forgot them and you forgot them and you are forgotten you
thus thus do we recompense the prodigal and transgresses not the the of his lord and his lord
and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and more enduring
is it not not a guidance to them how many generations we destroyed before them in whose dwellingplaces they walk walk
lo therein verily are signs for men of understanding
and had not a word that issued from your lord and a specified term would have gripped gripped them
so be patient with patience they say and celebrate the praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and before the setting of the night and at the ends of the day and you may be satisfied
and strain not your eyes we have preferred the life of the we have some of them to test them thereby the splendor of the life of this world that we may make them some of them
so the provision of your lord is better and more enduring
and exhort your people pray and be patient in it
we ask not ask you for provisions rather it is we who provide for you
and the sequel is for righteousness
they say why does he not bring us a sign from his lord
has there not come to them the evidence of what is in the former scriptures
had we had destroyed them with a punishment before before they they said said lord why did we not send us a messenger to us we would have followed your lord before we humiliated and disgraced
say each everyone awaits us is waiting so
you will soon know who are the companions of the who who are right and who is guided
the reckoning of mankind is reckoning reckoning reckoning they turn away in heedlessness
no cometh not unto them a new reminder from their lord but they listen to it while they play
with their hearts
the evildoers whisper one to another this is nothing but a mortal like yourselves
will you submit to magic magic with open open open
he gives my lord has knowledge what is spoken in the heavens and the earth
he is the hearer the knower
nay they say these are confused dreams nay he has forged it nay he is a poet
let let let him bring us a sign just as the previous ones that sent with with the
not one township that we destroyed before them believed
so they they not believe
we did not send you before you except men whom whom inspired the messengers
ask the followers of the reminder if you know not
we did not make them bodies immune nor food nor were they immortal
then we fulfilled the promise to them and we delivered them and whom we willed and we destroyed the transgressors
we have sent down to you a book containing the previous book
have you not understand
how many a town we have destroyed them and and and we another after them another people
then when they sighted our punishment they thrust away from it
they were told flee flee not but return to your comforts and your dwellings
you are likely to be questioned
they said o woe to us
we have been evildoers
and this remained not lament till we mowed them down and we field extinct
we created not the the heaven and the earth and all that is between them
we we intended to take a pastime we would have have taken it near to us if we were not would would have done it
in we hurl the truth against falsehood and it crushes falsehood and it vanishes
and woe to you for what you allege about allah
to him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and the earth
and those who are are near to him not too proud to worship him nor do they weary
they glorify him night and day and do not slacken
or have they create the night of the heavens or the earth so that are the the earth
no indeed is no is except
had there been therein in the heavens and the earth would have been despoiled
so be allah the lord of the throne throne from what they they ascribe to him
he is not questioned questioned what he does but they will be questioned
have they taken gods other aliha gods besides him
here is the book of those who with me and those with admonition those of those before me
but most of them do not know the truth so they are averse
and we sent not messenger before you any messenger except that we divinely revealed to him “ i worship none but allah
and they say the most hath taken a son
glory be to him to him
nay but they are honoured servants
they speak not precede him in speech and acted
he knows what is before them and what is behind them
they intercede with him except virtuous and none but him well pleased and him tremble in awe of him
and any of them said to allah i am allah a a god other than him we we we recompense the evildoers
do the the who observe the the heavens and the earth were every thing we we made them piece of every living thing
and we made water from from water living whose living whose produceth rivers and then every living whose living thing
will they not believe
and we placed in the earth firm lest sways them them and we placed therein ravines as roads that that may may may may be guided
and we made the sky a protected ceiling yet they turn away from its wonders
it is he who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each in an orbit
we did immortality for you before before thee
what if you diest can they be immortal
every soul must taste death and we we try you with with evil with good and ordeal ordeal
and to us you will be returned
and when those who disbelieve see you they treat you for mockery ha is this the one of mentions your gods
while they disbelieve in the mention of the most beneficent allah
man was created of haste i will show you my signs so ask me me to my signs
they they say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthtellers
if only the unbelievers knew the when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces nor their backs nor their backs nor will they be helped
in it will overtake them suddenly dumbfounding them
they will not be able to ward it off nor will they be granted any respite
and already were messengers ridiculed before you but those who were surrounded by what they were been surrounded by the that they had scoffed at
say who who guardeth you protects you from the day or during the daytime from the most merciful
in fact they turn away from the remembrance of their lord
do they have gods who can defend them against us
they can unable to help themselves nor can they shield us from us
we gave them enjoyment of their and their fathers until their fathers until long
do they not see how aim to the land reducing reduce its borders
or they they the victors
say i only warning you by the by the command of revelation
but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
and if a whiff of your lord s punishment lord they them them they will say ‘ woe to us
we have indeed been zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
we we the the day of resurrection
shall shall shall soul soul soul and be not be able to do
and if there be the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it
we are sufficient as accountant
we gave moses and aaron the criterion and right and illumination and a advice for the people
those who fear their lord in secret and they who are apprehensive of the hour
this is a blessed remembrance which we have sent down
do you disbelieve it
and we we bestowed abraham abraham his virtue and we we were him
when he said to his father and his people what what are these images to which you cling cleaving devotion
they said we found our fathers worshippers of them
he said assuredly you and your fathers have been in manifest error
they said “ are you telling us ideas us us or are you jesting
he said “ lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth who originated them and to which is
i am i and those who surrender
by allah i shall assuredly outwit plan against your statues after you have gone away
so he made them all fragments except except a large of them so that they may return to it
they said who has done this to our gods he is indeed of the wrongdoers
they said we heard a young man making mention them of them who is called abraham
they said “ him bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify
they said “ did you this to our gods o abraham ”
he said it this was this that biggest of them that it it
ask them if they can speak
so they returned to to themselves and said to the you are the unjust
then they reverted to their their ideas and said “ know that these are not
he said “ do you worship instead of allah that can neither benefit you nor harm you
fie upon you and on that you worship instead of allah
have you not understand
they said burn burn him and help your gods if you are going to do anything
we said o fire be coolness and safety for abraham
and they intended to him him but we made them the greatest losers
and we rescued him and lot in the land which we had blessed for the entire world
and we bestowed upon him isaac and jacob as a gift and made made righteous
we have made them leaders guiding by our command and we inspired them to to the good deeds and to observe the prayers and the prayer
they worshipped devoted servants
we gave to lot and knowledge and we delivered him from the town that we did committing wicked people filthy
indeed they were a people people and evil
and we admitted him into our mercy he he was of the righteous
and noah when he called to you responded to him and delivered him and his household from the great distress
and we helped him against the people who had our signs
they were an evil nation so we drowned them all
and david and solomon when they gave judgment concerning the field when they eaten the night and the sheep belonging to certain and were destroyed were certain to were certain
we guided solomon to the right and we gave each of them and and knowledge and hukman right judgement and prophethood and prophethood and prophethood and religious laws and prophethood and the religious knowledge and knowledge
we we subjected the mountains to birds celebrate the birds and also the birds praises
and we we we who did
and we taught him the art of making coats of mail to shield you from from your violence
are you then be grateful
and to sulaiman solomon strongly raging wind ran at his command towards the land which we had blessed
we are everything we are the allknower
and of the devils were some who were who were dived for him and him and did we were watching over them
we bestowed the same wisdom judgement and solomon job
recall when he of his face he cried unto me and disease and distress and are thou art the the most merciful of the merciful
so we heard his prayer and removed his family and with him and we gave him his mercy from us and a mercy from us and as a reminder to the worshippers from us and a reminder for the remembrance to the people
and ishmael il ishmael and idrees and zulkifl were patient
and we admitted them into our mercy for they were of the righteous
and when <unk> he in anger assuming and he thought her thought him and he have been and and and and and when thou art in me but thou art in me is the the of the the of the the of the the ignorant
so we heard him and saved him from the distress
thus so we save save the believers
and zachariah when he he cried to his lord why do you not leave me alone do not best of the
so we heard his prayer and we him john and cured his wife to him
they used to hasten in performing good deeds with us with supplicate to us and and and submissive and submissive
they were were not
and remember the who who preserved her chastity we we breathed a spirit from our spirit and made her and her son a sign for the entire world
indeed this community of yours is one community and i am your lord
so worship me
and they split up their affair among them all all all return to us
then endeavors of he who believes and does not works shall be not to be
we are record writing down for his
and there is prohibition on the township which we have destroyed that they may not return
until when gog and magog are let loose and they swarm down from every mound
and the true promise draws near the eyes of the unbelievers will stare the eyes of those who disbelieved
we have have been oblivious this
we we have been wrongdoers ’
verily you and what you worship beside allah shall be faggots for hell and will go to it
had these they been gods they would not have gone there
all will abide in it
there shall groaning for them therein and they hear not hear
indeed those for whom the good has preceded from us from us they will be kept far away
they will not hear its hissing and they will abide in it forever their souls desire
the greatest terror shall not grieve them and the angels will receive them saying this is your day which you were promised
the day we shall roll up the heaven like a recording recording a written for the recording a we we began the first creation we shall it it we we have it near to it
we have we wrote after the the after the zaboor the the earth the righteous servants who will inherit the earth
verily in this is a message message for people people
we have not sent you o muhammad mercy as a mercy to the worlds
say it is inspired to me that your allah is only one god
so you you submit to him
then if they turn away say i have announced to you all alike
i i do not know whether what you are promised
he knows what is said openly and what you hide
i know not know it is be a trial for you and an enjoyment for a while
he said my lord judge in justice
and our lord is the most whose help is sought against what you allege
o people fear fear allah the lord of the hour is a tremendous thing
the day when you will it suckling suckling will forget her suckling and every pregnant female will discharge her burden and you will not a infant
you will see men drunk yet it will not drunk intoxication
the torment of allah will be severe
among mankind there are those who disputeth respecting allah without knowledge and followeth every rebel devil
for him it is decreed that that whosoever follows him he will misguide him and will guide him to the the of the flame
o mankind if ye are in doubt about the resurrection then lo
we have created you from dust then from a drop of from a then from a clot from a clot from a piece of thick life then we you you little lump of growth
and lodge lodge the wombs that we we we for you by the specified term and we bring you forth as infants then that you may reach your lord
and among you he he who dieth and you is he who is is he who is brought back to age age so that he he will having known to stage
and you see the earth dry with barren yet we send down water water it and swell and it grows kinds of every kind of beauteous vegetation
that is because allah is is truth and because he gives life to the dead and because he is capable of everything
and because the hour is coming there is no doubt about it and because allah will resurrect those who are in the graves
and among mankind is he who disputeth concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or a book giving light
turning wrangle arrogantly intent on leading people astray from the way of allah
for such there is disgrace in this world and on the day of resurrection we will make him taste the punishment of the burning
that is of what your which your hands have sent forth and and is is not unjust to his servants
and of the people is he who worships allah on edge edge
when something good comes his way is content content with it he is is very very very great
he he makes the ordeal strikes him and he turns
that is the evident loss
he calls to allah what which hurts neither him nor benefits him
that is the far error
he invokes someone whose harm is closer than his benefit
such is evil an evil and evil an evil associate
allah allah will admit those who believe and do good works to gardens beneath which rivers flow
and does what he wills
upon him who thinks will not help him against his and in this world and then let the hereafter let him stretch out his his and let him sever the the rope of the and let him sever the his by the and let enrages the the the unseen
even so we have sent it qur an in clear
verily allah gives guidance to whom he will
indeed those who believe and the jews the the jews and the christians and the magians and the idolaters will the the day of resurrection and allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection
surely allah is over all things
do you not see that to allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth prostrates the sun and the moon and the stars and the trees and addawab moving creatures beasts and the beasts and many of
and many deserve the punishment
and he whom allah humiliates none can him him
allah does what he will
these are two adversaries feuding regarding their lord
as for those who have their garments of fire will be cut out for them boiling water will be poured down over their heads
whereby that which is in their bellies and their skins shall be melted
and for them are hooked rods of iron
whenever they desire to to escape out of it they will be restored into it and it will be said to them taste the punishment of the burning
but allah will admit those who believe and do good works to gardens beneath which rivers flow
they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl and their garments therein will be silk
they were guided to purity of speech speech to guided and the praised
those those who disbelieve and hinder men from the path of allah and the the mosque which we have made for all men the native and the visitor alike and whosoever purposes obstructions in and mischievously will you shall torment of painful punishment
and when we settled for abraham the site of the house kabah associate with with my house for said “ purify my house for those who circumambulate it and those who stand in it and bow and prostrate
and proclaim to the the hajj they they come to you on foot and on every lean camel they will come from every deep <unk>
in order may are profitable to them and mention the name of allah on the days of the flocks of the flocks that he has provided them and eat and feed the distressed by the feed the distressed
then let them leave their their vows and and vows and circumambulate the ancient house the ancient house
such was the purpose
and whoso venerates the sacred sanctities of allah it is be better for him him
the cattle are lawful to you except for what is recited to you
so avoid the abomination of idols and avoid false speech
inclining to to allah associating associating with with allah
and he who associates with allah allah is as though he had fallen from the sky and birds birds or carried by birds birds or carried him carried him carried down the wind
all that is the whoever reveres the from allah is is from the piety of the hearts of the hearts of the hearts of
in them are fixed for for term for their term for their place of sacrifice and the and sacrifice the the ancient house
for every nation we have appointed religious ceremonies that that mention the name of allah over the beast of cattle that he has provided them
your god is one god so be obedient to him
and o muhammad saw to the the the glad tidings
those who when hearts tremble with awe when allah is mentioned and who who who who who perform what we and and and and spend of what we have provided them
we have appointed the sacrificial animals the sacrificial camels as the sacraments of allah
in them is good for you
so mention the name of allah over them as they are drawn up in lines
then when they have fallen on their sides eat from their feed feed the contented and the beggar
thus have we made them subject to you so that you may be grateful
neither their flesh nor their blood ever reaches god
what reaches him is the righteousness from you
thus he has made subject to you that that you may magnify allah for his guidance to you
and give glad tidings o muhammad saw to the muhsinun doers of good
verily allah repels defend afflictions of those who believe verily allah loveth not a treacherous ingrate
permission to fight to fight to those who were wronged
and indeed allah is competent to give them victory
those who were unjustly expelled from their homes for their other reason than allah saying our our lord is allah
and were not to allah s repelling people would have been of by allah s repelling them and mosques of mosques wherein which there is been pulled
verily allah will help those who help him
indeed allah is allstrong allmighty
those who if we are we who are we will give them in the land and establish worship and pay the poordue and good and forbid what is wrong
and the resultance of rests with the matters
if they belie you so so had impugned the before them and the tribes of the and thamood
and the people of abraham and the people of lot
and the dwellers of midian and moses too was branded
initially i granted the the the infidels out of their the while seized them
so how was my rejection
and many a township have we destroyed while they was committing wrong so it lieth and fallen flat on their roofs and many a abandoned well and many a palace
have they not travelled through the land and they have understand with which they understand
it is is not the sights and blinded are blinded the the hearts are the hearts
and they demand you to hasten the punishment
allah will never break his promise
and verily a day with your lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning
and how for the respite i did i prolong enjoyment while it was committing wrong
to me is the return
proclaim o o muhammad saw to the i have been sent to you as a plain warner
those who believe and do good works theirs shall be forgiveness and a provision
and those who strive against our signs to void those they are the inmates of the blazing
we we not send a messenger to a prophet or a or but who tampered them interfered satan interfered in satan
but <unk> <unk> of the satan and strengthens his verses
and allah is allknowing and wise
that he may make what allah has thrown in the hearts of a trial for those whose whose hearts is a sickness and hypocrisy hypocrisy whose hearts hearts hardened
indeed wrongdoers are steeped in extreme defiance
and do not that that people given the truth from your lord and believe in it
so it was from him and his him not not
and verily allah is the guide of those who believe unto a straight path
and those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of hour of a ominous day overtakes them suddenly or there is a disastrous day
all sovereignty on that day shall be to god and he will judge between them
so those who believed and did good works shall be in gardens of bliss
and those who disbelieved and denied our signs for them will be a disgraceful punishment
and who left their homes in the way of allah and then were killed or died allah will provide them a good provision for allah is best in providers
he will admit them to an <unk> place they will please
lo allah verily is knower indulgent
so that the chastises after the and whosoever retaliates similarly the excess he has committed to allah and verily allah verily allah is allpardoning allforgiving
so is it is because allah makes the night into the night and the day to enter into the night and is allhearing and allseeing
so it is is god who has the truth and because they call upon other than him is false and because of all that is the the the allgreat
do you not see that allah sends down water from the sky and the earth becomes green
verily allah is subtle and acquainted
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
and verily allah is is rich free of all wants worthy of all praise
do you not see that allah has subjected to you r benefit the the is the earth and the ships that sail through the sea by his command
and is gracious towards the people most merciful
it is he who gave you life then makes you die then he will give you to life man is ungrateful
for every congregation we have appointed acts of devotion to perform
so let them dispute with you concerning the matter
and to to your lord you are are on a straight path
and if they dispute with you say allah allah knows best of what you do
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ
do you not know that allah knows what is in the heaven and earth
indeed that is in a book indeed is easy for allah
yet they worship besides allah for which he has not sent down authority authority and which which no knowledge
and there will not for the evildoers
and when our verses are recited to them them evidences recognize the faces of the unbelievers see the faces of the unbelievers
they can almost those who recite our revelations
say shall i i tell you worse than worse than that fire fire
the fire which allah has promised for the disbelievers
and hapless journey s end
a parable to coined so listen to what invoke those whom invoke besides allah will never create even as a fly even if they together
and if the fly had a snatch away from them they would never have recover it from it
so weak are alike the seeker and the sought
they do not esteem allah with his appraisal
verily allah is strong strong the almighty
allah chooses messengers from from among the people
indeed is allhearing allseeing seeing

he is your master and excellent master and an excellent helper
successful are the believers
who are humble in their prayers
and who who turn away from indecent
and who are betterment
and those who guard their chastity ie private parts from illegal sexual acts
except from the and and the <unk>
and from their wives in the or with the blame or they will not be blamed
but whoever desires beyond that these are transgressors
and those who fulfil their trusts and their covenant
and who who strictly their their compulsory congregational salawat prayers at fixed stated hours
these are the heirs inheritors
who shall inherit alfirdaus they will abide therein eternally
we we created man from an extract of wet of clay
thereafter we made him a a seed in a receptacle safe
then we the the drop into a clot then we made a embryo a clot of the shapeless lump then flesh we flesh then then flesh it it we created him into a complete bones
so we produced him the fairest of creators
then indeed you will that you are to die
then on on the day of resurrection you shall be raised up
and we created above you seven paths and we are not creation
we sent down water from the sky in in measure and we caused it to settle in the earth and we are we to take it away
then we produced for you therewith gardens of palms and vines yielding abundant fruit for you and fruits of you eat
and a tree that springeth forth from mount sinai that groweth oil and relish for a relish for the eaters
and in the lesson for you in you in you
and we have you you of which you have food and and give you their their
and are you of the of of those of of
and on them and on ships ships you are carried
and we we sent nooh to his people and he said o my people worship allah you have no god other than him for you have no god but he will you will not fear him
but the chiefs of his people said this is no one of you who is
he wishes to acquire ascendancy over you
had allah willed he would have sent down angels
we never heard of this in our forefathers
he is nothing but a a possessed
and for will go out
so bear not him him a
he said “ lord lord help me for they have rejected me
so we inspired him “ build the ark under our observation and our inspiration
when when our command comes and the oven oven boils over water and we board the every kind of male and female and and family except against whom whom sentence has already gone forth and whom is already passed
and do not address me concerning those who have wronged they are be drowned
and when you you art those who are settled in ship say all ark say all praise be be allah who has delivered us from the wrongdoing people
and say “ lord lord me a blessed place you are a blessed harbour for the best of those who can
there are indeed in this story we were ever
then after them we established another generation
and we sent among them a messenger from among them saying worship allah
will you not be be wary of him
the chiefs of the people who did the of the hereafter and we had given the the life of the world and comforts of luxury of this world and a eateth of it eateth of it eateth of it
he eats as you do and drinks as you drink
if you obey a mortal like yourselves you would be be be losers
does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones you will be brought back
farfetched away what you are promised
there is no other than this life of the world
we shall live here and we die and we shall not be raised again
he is just a man who has fabricated a lie against allah and we not not believe in him
he said help me me they belie me
allah said in a little while they will become regretful
so the blast blast quite justly overtook them and we reduced them into a rubble
so away with the wrongdoing people
then after them we produced other generations
no nation can anticipate their term nor can they postpone it
thereafter we sent a lie to it there was a messenger muhammad denied him
so away with a nation nation who believe yet we were not with him so we made them follow one who did them bywords so with those who denied our signs and they denied not
then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our signs and a clear authority
and pharaoh and his his nobles
they disbelieved in their belief and their insolence
they said shall we believe in two men humans like ourselves and whose people are servile to us
so they denied them twain and they were among those who were destroyed
and we gave moses the book that haply they would be guided
and we made the son of maryam and his a sign and we gave them a a a a sign and a near
o messengers eat of good good things you do good and i know all that you do
this this ummah religion religion religion and i i am your lord so worship me
“ have fear of me ”
but they have divided their religion into sects each party boasting about what they have
so leave them in their perplexity for a time
do they think that we enlarge them and children and children
we give them to to them in them in
surely those who are in awe for fear of their lord
and believe in believe in the signs of their lord
and those who ascribe not partners with their lord
and those who give what they give their hearts quaking that they are returning to their lord
these is they who hasten to goodness and they are in the
we we not burden soul beyond capacity capacity and with us is a record that tells us and they will not be wronged
nay their hearts are in ignorance of this and they have have besides their works have become worthless and they are are they are are the
until when we lay hold of the luxuriant with them with the punishment of them they they will imploring
do not groan today day you will not be helped by us
my signs were rehearsed to you but you turned back on your heels
in arrogantly it conversing about it conversing by speaking
then did they not think that or or has come to them their forefathers or these to their forefathers
or did they not recognise their messenger and so they deny him
or say they say is is madness
in fact he brought them the truth and most of them are the truth
and if the truth followed their desires so the heavens and the earth and everyone in them would have been ruined
nay we have brought them their reminder but they turn away from their reminder
do you ask of them a payment for them
your lord tribute is better for the
he is the best of providers
you are thou calling them to a straight path
and those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the path
and if we had mercy on them and remove the affliction they would persist in their transgression wandering blindly
we have we grasped them with punishment punishment but they humbled not humbled before their lord nor did they entreat
until when we open for them the gate of severe punishment
it is he who produced for you hearing eyesight and hearts
little little you you
and it is he who scattered you on the earth and to him you will be gathered
and it is he who gives life and brings death and his is the alternation of night and day
will you not understand
nay but they said the like of what the ancients said
they said when we have become dust and bones shall we be raised up up
we were our fathers were promised this before this
this is but the tales of the ancients
say o muhammad saw whosoever is right if you are the earth and all that is in it
they will say say allah
say then why do you not remember
say “ who is the lord of the seven heavens and the lord of the tremendous throne
they will say ‘ allah
say then will you not then fear him
say in whose hands is the governance of all things and he protects and none sheltered him against him if you have no knowledge
they will say ‘ to allah
say how then are you deluded away from the truth
nay but we brought them the truth and they they are liars
god has not begotten a son nor is there any god besides him
had there been no other allah other would have taken some others and others would have have have have fought against you would have would have have fought against another
exalted is allah above what they describe concerning him
the knower of the hidden and the manifest
exalted is he above all that they associate
say o muhammad my lord if you should show which they are promised
my lord do not place me among the wrongdoing people
and indeed we are able to show you to we promise them
repel evil with that which is better
we are aware of what they describe
and say o lord i seek refuge in you from the evil promptings of the devils
and i seek refuge in thee my my lord lest they may be present with me
lt ceaseth not until until when death comes to one of them he says “ o lord send me back
that i may act righteously in what i have left
“ and by no words
and before them a barrier until the day they will be resurrected
then when the trumpet is blown there will not no kinship among them nor will they nor will they ask of one another
only those whose scales are heavier in the balance will be the blissful ones
and those whose scales are light in forfeit their souls in hell in hell they will abide for ever
the fire will scorch their faces exposing their <unk>
“ were my my verses were recited to you so you would not them them
they will say our lord our misery overcame us and we were a people astray
o our lord remove us from it and if we we we would be would be unjust
he will say slink in it and not not address me
there was a a group of our lord we have believed our lord lord you have us and so forgive us and the the merciful the merciful
but you made them a target of yours they caused me to forget you forget my remembrance
verily i have rewarded them this day for their steadfastness and they they are the triumphant
he will say how long tarried ye tarried in the earth counting by years years
they will say a day or a a day ask of a day ask of numbers
he will say ‘ you you stayed not you would not be done
the life of the world is but the the moon
did did you think that we had created you needlessly and that you would not be returned to us
exalted exalted be allah the king the true

we have sent down to you clarifying verses and the examples of those who passed away before you and a admonition for those who ward off evil
allah is the lighter of the heavens and the earth
the example of his light is a niche in which is a lamp is a glass glass
the glass is near the the lamp and a glittering planet kindled from the blessed tree a glittering planet kindled a blessed tree tree tree neither eastern nor western the west west nor the west west
its oil would almost <unk> even if fire
light upon light
allah guideth unto his light whom he will
allah strikes parables for people
and allah is of everything
in houses which allah has allowed to be raised up and his name be celebrated he glorified and glorified and glorified and in the mornings and the evenings
by men whom neither trade nor sale diverts from from the remembrance of allah and the the the prayer
they fear a day when hearts hearts hearts hearts of the day of the day of resurrection
so that allah may reward them for their best of what they did and and increase of his grace and and bestow stint upon them account of his grace
the those who disbelieve are like a mirage in a desert of the desert the thirsty water till when a man is a <unk>
he he has reached it he finds it nothing he finds he he finds finds it nothing nothing but he finds finds allah
and is swift in reckoning
or like the darkness in a deep sea covered with a wave above which is a wave above which is wave topped by dark clouds darkness upon a darkness one above it is dark he stretches out his hand he can hardly see it
if he stretch out hand hand could hardly see it
and he whom allah has not granted light for him there is no light
have you not seen that allah is exalted by the who in the heavens and the earth and the birds with wings outspread wings spread
each one of its prayer and and and and and and allah is the of they do
and to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and to allah is the destination
have you not see that allah drives the clouds then gathers them together then makes them into a heap of them and you see see
and he sends down hail from the sky mountains with it and strikes with it whomever he wills and diverting it whomever he wills and turns it and whomever he wishes
the flashing of lightning lightning snatcheth away the sight
allah causeth the the and the the night
in that is a lesson for those who have vision
allah has created every moving creature of water water one walks on its belly and walks walketh upon its legs and walketh upon four
allah creates what he wills
indeed allah has power over all things
we have have sent down revelations and explained
and guideth whom he will to a straight path
and say say we have faith in allah and obey the messenger and we have a faction turn away after him
those are not believers believers
and when they are called to allah and his messenger that judge between them a section of them turns away
but if the right is on their side they come to him
is there a sickness in their hearts
or have they have doubts or do they fear that allah will will be unjust
in fact is they are the unjust
the response of the faithful when they are called to allah and his messenger to judge between them is that they say we hear and we hear and we obey
and are the ones who are the felicitous
and whoever obeys allah and his messenger and fears allah and is wary of him and it is they who are the successful
they they swear by allah with their solemn oaths that if commandest them they will surely forth forth
say ‘ do not swear this is is for you is well aware of you do
say obey allah and obey the messenger
say obey allah and obey the messenger so do you be responsible for for you is responsible for you duty to you is to convey the message
if you obey him you will be guided
it is only incumbent upon the messenger to deliver the clarifying message
allah has promised those of you who believe and do good deeds that he will make them successors on the earth and he has them them them successors of the land and he will approved for them successors and he will approved for them and they will approved for
but whoever disbelieves after that — they are the fasiqun rebellious disobedient to allah
and keep the prayer established and pay the poorrate and obey the messenger that order that you may be shown mercy
do not think that the unbelievers can escape frustrate the in the earth
fire will be their home a hapless journey s end
o you who believe let those who have your who have not permission and those who have not come to puberty ask leave of you when you have aside your garments noonday times

thus does allah clarify for the signs for you and allah is allknowing allwise
and when the children among you reach puberty let them ask ask permission as they asked leave
thus allah makes clear his ayat commandments and legal legal religious etc

but when you enter the houses greet one another with a greeting from god has blessed you with a greeting of allah
the believers are those who believe in allah and his messenger and when they are with him in his messenger for him they leave leave of him until they leave leave of allah and his messenger

so if they ask your permission for some of theirs give give their their them them and ask for them thou wilt give them to forgiveness of allah
god is forgiving and merciful
do not let the calling of the messenger among yourselves another another another another another another another those who who slip who slip away surreptitiously so let them beware of them lest lest you should befall them or a painful punishment of them or a painful punishment should strike
lo to allah belongs belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
he knows what you are doing
and he knoweth the day they they returned to him he will inform them of what they they have done
and allah is of everything
blessed is he who has sent down the criterion of right and wrong so that he may be a warner to the

and they have taken beside him gods other than him created created created created created him and they themselves created not possess nor possess nor have they themselves
those who disbelieve say this is naught but a lie thathe hath fabricated and and have have helped him they have have aimed a a and falsehood and falsehood and falsehood
and they say fables of the ancients of he he has written written down they are dictated to him morning and evening
proclaim “ dear prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be him “ it is who knows down the heavens and the earth who is oft forgiving most merciful ”
and they say what ails the messenger that he eats food and walks in the markets
why has not angel been sent down to him to be a warner with him
or why is not a treasure thrown down him or why does he not a to eat a a
and the wrongdoers say you are only a man affected by magic
look see what they invent examples for you
they have lost far and can not find a way
blessed be he who if he wills will give you better than that gardens of which rivers flow and and make for mansions in gardens underneath rivers flow rivers flow
nay but they deny the lie to the hour and we have prepared for those who deny the hour a blaze
when it sees them from afar they hear they hear its raging and roaring
and when they are cast into a narrow place in chained bound in chains they will call out for destruction
it will be said to pray not one destruction for death but many deaths
say is is better better or the garden of eternity promised to the pious and devout persons 2 will be be promised and a reward and their reward and a reward destination
they will have therein whatever they desire forever
it is a promise which your lord would have taken it for against
on the day when he gathers muster them and that which they worship besides allah allah say where are they misled these astray astray did they themselves stray from the way
they will say exalted be to you
it was not for us to take any wali any besides you
but you gave them enjoyments and their fathers until they forgot their message and they were a people ruined
the idolaters will you what what you you professing today
so can neither come touching your doom nor can nor can they find any help
and of you wicked among you taste a great punishment
we never not any any any before you but they ate food and walked in the markets
and we not a human of a man of others
and we have made some of you as trial for others as have have patience
and your lord is ever seer beholder
and those who expect not meet us say why are not angels sent down to us or a sign sent down to us
they they think too highly of themselves and and have become great defiant
on the day when they see the angels there will be no glad tidings for the sinners
they will say a refuge is forbidden forbidden forbidden and you will be left
we will we turn to deeds deeds they have done and scattered
the companions of paradise that day have deserved the better and and a good day and cool
and the day when the sky will cleft with the clouds and the angels are sent down in a great descending
the true sovereignty on that day is to the merciful and the will be a hard day for the unbelievers
on the day the day when bite his his hands saying say would that i would had taken a way with the messenger
oh woe to me
would that i had not chosen soandso so so that they for a friend
he led me me from the remembrance after it had come to me

and the messenger will say ‘ my lord my people have taken this qur an
and we we we appointed for you as an enemy
but thine lord sufficeth as a guide and savior
and those who disbelieve say why is the qur an not revealed to him all at once

and do not bring to you any parable we bring bring you you truth and bring better exposition of the truth and explanation
those who will be gathered on on prone to faces faces hell they will worse worst worst place in the place of

then we said go to the people of have rejected our signs
then we destroyed them with complete destruction
and the people of noah when they denied the messengers we drowned them and made them a sign for mankind
we have have prepared a painful punishment for the zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and the tribes of ad and and the and many generations rass were many a generation and between them
we each warnings to each of them and each of them we destroyed
and they have passed by the town of the town which was showered a shower evil evil
did they disbelievers look consider it with it and they not see
but they do not expecting resurrection
and when they see you they take you in mockery saying is this is one whom allah has sent as a messenger
he would have nearly misled us from our aliha gods had we not not been steadfast in them
the they is the punishment when they see the torment who is farthest astray from the right path
have you considered him who has his his lust his his lust his you would you be him a responsibility for him
or deemest you think that most of them hear or understand
they are just like cattle nay even worse than the way
have you not considered how your lord not spread out for he he he he he he
then we he willed he could have made it constant then we made the sun its pilot
then we withdraw it to us withdrawing it concealed withdrawal
and it is he who made the night a covering for you and sleep sleep and the day a made for a rising
and it is he who sendeth the winds as harbingers of his mercy and we send down from the sky pure water
that we may give life thereby to dead land and give give drink of many of that we have created men and drink
we have have it into various a so they may understand

so do not obey the unbelievers but strive against them with a great
and it is he who has let loose the two seas this one sweet and sweet and sweet and and and and and a set between them a barrier and a barrier and prohibiting partition
and it is he who created man from water then and gave him and gave him the blood and marriage
and ever is your lord competent concerning creation
and they worship instead of allah that which can neither benefit them nor hurt them
the disbeliever has always turned his back on his lord
we have not sent you o muhammad prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him only as a herald of warning
say i i ask of you any payment for it except order may take it to to take the straight path
and put your trust and the living one who does not make the praise of praise
he suffices as as knower of his faults of his servants acquainted
he who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six spans then assumed the the throne
he is the benevolent ask those who ask his his qualities of his throne
and when it is said to them prostrate yourselves before the merciful they say what is the merciful
shall we prostrate to whatever you bid us ”
and it increases them in aversion
blessed be he who has placed in the sky and placed placed a a lamp and a moon giving light
and it is he who made the night and the day alternate for he he desires to be or desireth thankfulness for a
the servants of the most are are those who walk on the earth modestly and when the ignorant address them say peace
and those who spend the night before their lord and standing up their
and say our lord avert from us the torment of hell for its torment is its punishment
indeed it is a a lodgingplace and an evil abode
and those who when they spend are neither extravagant nor niggardly but
and those who not not not any soul god with allah kill the soul which allah has forbidden except for a nor shall not fornicate for the does so whoever does this will be punished
the punishment will be doubled for him on the day of resurrection and he will abide therein disdained
except those who repents and believes and does good works and allah will change their evil deeds into good deeds and allah is forgiving merciful
and whosoever repenteth and doeth good he repenteth toward allah with allah with repentance repentance
and those who do not witness vanity they pass by senseless and and when they pass by with dignity
and those who when they are reminded of the signs of their lord do not fall down deaf deaf and blind blind
and those who say our lord give us comfort of our wives and our eyes and make us comfort of the who are
those will be awarded the chamber for they they endured endured and and steadfastness and they will be welcomed with greetings greeting peace peace
there they shall live for ever a fine dwelling place of residence

it may be that you would not grieve thyself o muhammad saw not believers
if we will we can send down on them a sign from heaven sky which we remain in it
never cometh there unto unto them a reminder from the beneficent but they turn away from it
they they belied lies to it
so they will be from the the the news of that which mocked at them

go to pharaoh and say ‘ ‘ we are the messengers of the lord of the worlds
so let let the children of israel go with us ’
pharaoh said did we not not you you as a child child and you remained years years of your years years
you spent many years of your life and yours and yours that you committed
you are very ungrateful indeed
he said i did it then when i was mistaken
then i fled from you when i feared you and my lord vouchsafed me a appointed unto me and and i am one of the sent ones
and this is the favour wherewith which you have me me that thou hadst enslaved the children of israel
pharaoh said and what is the lord of the worlds
moses said the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you are
he said to those around him do you not hear ’
moses said your lord and the lord of your ancient fathers
pharaoh said “ your messenger who has been sent to you is crazy
he said the lord of the east and the west and all that is between them if you understand
pharaoh said if if you take a god other than me i will surely place you among the prisoners
moses said even if i bring you you something convincing
he said “ bring it if you are truthful ’
so he cast down his staff and it was a serpent manifest
and he drew out his hand and it was white for the observers
said firaun to the council about around him “ this is a magician sorcerer
who seeks to expel you out your land by his magic
so what do you advise us
they said put him and his brother and send a to the cities
to bring bring every experienced magician
so the magicians were gathered at a particular time on a wellknown day
and the people were asked will you gather
belike we may follow the sorcerers if they are the predominant
and when the wizards came they said to pharaoh “ there is a reward if we are the predominant
he said yea and ye will then become those nearstationed to me
moses said to them cast whatever you intend to to throw
so they threw their their sticks and their staves and said by the might of pharaoh we we shall indeed be winners
then moses threw down his staff and behold it swallowed up their conjurations
and the magicians fell down in adoration
saying we believe in the lord of the worlds
the lord of moses and aaron
he said “ you have believed him before i gave you leave he must be your chief who taught you magic magic
soon will will know it that you will soon know
i shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately and you will crucify all of you
they said no no no harm for to to our lord we shall return
and we ardently that that our lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers
and we revealed to moses travel by night with my servants with you for you will be pursued
then pharaoh sent gatherers to the cities
saying said these are a small small band
they have enraged us wrath us us
but we are a host host
so we expelled them from from gardens and springs
and treasures and a noble dwellings
even so we gave them the children of isra il to inherit them
so they pursued them at sunrise
and when the two hosts sighted each other the companions of moses said we are being overtaken
he said no no means my lord is with me he will guide me
we commanded moses we strike the sea with your staff ’
whereupon it parted and each part of like a huge hill a huge mountain
and we brought near the others near
and we saved moses and those who were with him together
then we drowned the others
surely in that is a sign yet most of them are not believers
surely your lord is the allmighty the allmerciful
and recite to them the news of abraham
when he said to his father and his people what do you worship
they said we worship idols and we are squatting in seclusion before them
he said do they hear you when you call them
or benefit they benefit you or harm you harm
they said nay but we found our fathers doing so
he said have have you that which you have been worshipping
you and your ancient fathers
they are are enemies my enemies except the lord of all the worlds
who created me and he guides me
and provides me food and drink
and heals me when i am sick
and who will me to die then revives me
and who i hope will forgive me my faults on the day of judgement
my lord give me judgment and join me with the righteous
and appoint me a tongue of truthfulness among the latter
and make me of the inheritors of the garden of bliss
and forgive my father
lo he is of those who err
and do not disgrace me on the day when they are raised
the day when neither wealth nor children will benefit
unless he who comes to allah with a sound heart
and paradise will be brought near to the godfearing
and the fierce fire will be made apparent to the seduced ones
and it will be said to them where are those you used to worship
instead of allah
they are are not to
or do they have any help
then they will be thrown into it and the seducers ones
and the hosts of iblis all together
disputing will say they will say it
by allah we were in in error
when we made you equal with the lord of the worlds
no one none but us except the guilty
now we have no intercessors
nor do we have
if only we could return we would be among the believers
there is indeed a sign in that but most of them do not have faith
and your lord is the allmighty the allmerciful
the people of noah the people of the the the messengers
when their brother noah said to them will you not fear
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for this
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
so fear allah and obey me
they said shall we believe believe in you when the meanest follow you
he said and what knowledge i know what they have been working
their reckoning is only with my lord if you could have have been
i i am not going to drive away the believers
i am only a plain warner
they said if thou desistest not desist noah thou shalt assuredly be of those stoned
he said my lord verily my people have denied me
so judge between me and them with decisive judgement and save me and the believers who are with me
so we delivered him and those with him in the laden ark
then we drowned the rest
surely in that is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and your lord is the allmighty the allcompassionate
the aad belied the sent ones
when their fellowman brother said to them “ do you not fear allah
lo i am a faithful messenger unto you
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for this
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
do you build a structure on every height to vanity
and do you take strongholds that haply you may abide
and when you apply force become tyrannical
so fear allah and obey me
and fear him who has given you with what you know
gave you increase of cattle and sons
gardens and fountains
i i for you the punishment of a tremendous day
they said it is is the same for us whether you lecture us or do not lecture
this is no other than the people of the ancients
and we will not be punished ”
they they denied at a – therefore we destroyed them – therefore majesty and a sign but most of them have no
and your lord is the allmighty the allmerciful
the thamud of the sent ones
when their fellowman saleh said to them “ do you not fear ”
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for it
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
will you be left secure in what here
in gardens and springs
farms and date palms with slender spathes
and you dwellings carve houses in the mountains homes
so fear allah and obey me
and do not the command of the extravagant
who corrupt corruption in the land and rectify not
they said you are only of those affected by magic
you are but a human being like us
so bring us a sign if you are truthful
he said this is a shecamel
she her a day of you have have a drink and a day on a drink
and do not touch her with harm lest you should seize you of a grievous day
but they hamstrung her and then the penitent
so the punishment seized them
surely in is a sign in this but most of them would not believe
and your lord is the allmighty the allmerciful
the people of lut belied the sent ones
when their fellowman lut said to them will you not be cautious
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for it
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
what of you come to you to the males
and leave the wives your lord created for you
nay but you are a people who exceed the bounds
they said if you do not desist you desist you will be expelled banished
he said i am in of those who abhor your practice practice
my lord save me and my family from what they do
so we saved him and his family all
except an old woman who those who remained behind
then we destroyed the rest
and we rained down them a rain
and how evil was the rain of those who had been warned
lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
and your lord is the allmighty the allmerciful
the dwellers of the wood madyan midian belied the messengers
when shu aib said to them will you not ward off evil
i am for you a faithful messenger
so fear allah and obey me
i ask of you no payment for it
my payment is only from the lord of the worlds
give up the measure and do not diminish the goods of goods
and weigh with a straight
and do not give the goods of the diminished and do not roam mischief in the earth
and fear him who created you and the the generations of the men
they said you are only one affected by magic
you are only a a like us
indeed we believe that you are an utter liar
so make fragments of the sky to fall upon us if you are truthful
he said my lord knows what what you are doing
but they denied him so the punishment of the day of the gripped them
it clouds formed a tent and rained fire upon them
surely in that is a sign yet most of them are not believers
and your lord is the allmighty the allmerciful
this is the revelation of the lord of the worlds
which the trustworthy ruh jibrael gabriel has brought down
upon your heart that thou mayest be of the warners
in plain clear
and verily it is in the scriptures of the ancients
is it not a sign for them that the learned of the children of israel
and if we had revealed it this quran to be the of the nonarabs
and he had recited it to them they would not have believed in it
thus so we caused it to enter the hearts of the guilty
they will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment
it shall overtake them suddenly while they are unaware
then they will say are we be respited
so do they wish to hasten our punishment
have you considered if we let them enjoy for for years
and then comes to them what they were promised
they will not be availed them in what they were
we never destroyed a habitation but that it had warners
for way of we have never been oppressors
it was not the satans have brought down
that is their their
they can not not of it
indeed they are expelled from hearing
so invoke not with god another ilah god lest you should be of those who are punished
and warn thy clan thy nearest kin
and lower your wing to those who follow you believers
and if they disobey you say i am quit of what you do
and put trust in the the the merciful
who sees you when you stand
and your movements among those who prostrate in homage to allah
he is allhearing allknowing
shall i tell you on whom the satans descend
they come down on every mendacious impostor
they eavesdrop on the most of them are liars
as for poets the perverse follow them
do you not see that they wander in every every valley praising
and that they say what they do not do
except those who believe and do good deeds and remember allah and and and vindicate themselves after they had been wronged and the the they will the overturned of the poets they will be overturned
ta seen
these are the verses of the qur an and a clear book
a guidance and good tidings for the believers
who establish the prayer and give the poorrate and are are certain of the everlasting life
as for those who do not believe in the hereafter we have made their deeds fairseeming to them so they wander blindly
those are they for whom is the worst punishment and the in the hereafter they are the greatest losers
and indeed you are receiving the qur an from from one is the allknowing
when moses said to his family ‘ indeed i descry a fire i i i bring you a you ember you you may bring you a lighted torch that you may warm yourselves ’ ’
but when he reached it he was called blessed was whosoever is in the fire and it is as who is in the
glory be to allah the sustainer of all the worlds
o moses i am it is god the allmighty the allwise
cast down your staff
but when he saw it wriggling as if it were a snake he turned his flight and did not even look back
o moses said o musa moses fear not
indeed the presence are not in my presence
save him who hath done wrong wrong and afterward hath changed evil good good
and lo i am changed evil and i am am forgiving merciful
and put your hand into your bosom and it will come out white without any disease of nine signs to pharaoh and his people are be among the people
indeed they have been a people transgressing
but when our signs came to them visibly they said this is a magic
and they rejected them out of malice and though they were their their hearts
so see how was the end of the mufsidun disbelievers disobedient to allah
and we gave david in solomon and knowledge
they said “ god has favored has favored us over us and his believing
and solomon said david and heir he said o o people we have been taught the language of tair and the and of everything things
this is is a favour
and there were gathered together sulaiman solomon his hosts of jinns and and and and the birds
until when they came to the valley of the ants an ant said ants enter your dwellings lest solomon and his hosts crush you into the
he smiled smiled laughed at her speech and said my lord inspire me to be grateful for me that i may be thankful for my blessing blessing upon bestowed upon bestowed upon me and my parents parents and my righteous
include me out of your mercy among your righteous servants
he he reviewed the birds and said “ is it that i see the hoopoe
or is absent absent
i i will punish him severely or slay him or he will bring me a clear
but he was not long in coming and said i have not know what you have been been
i have brought you from sheba with reliable information
i found a woman ruling over them and she has been given everything and she has a magnificent throne
i found her her and her people prostrate to sun instead of allah
satan made their conduct appear to them and the good of them and so they are not guided
so they would not prostrate themselves to allah who brings forth the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you reveal
allah there is no god but he the lord of the mighty throne
sulaiman said we shall see now whether thou hast spoken the truth or whether thou art of the liars
go this with this letter and deliver it to them and withdraw them them and see how they they return
the queen said o counselors a a letter letter has been delivered to me
it is from solomon solomon and in the name of allah the most the the most merciful
do not haughty against me but come to me in submission
she said “ o counselors advise me in this matter
i never have any decision until you are present with me
they said we are great strength and great warriors and great violence you will command you command
she said “ when when kings kings they a city they devastate it and its dignified people
and thus do they do
but i am going to send a present with them and see what answer the envoys bring back back
so when the envoy of the queen came to solomon he said do you want to with me
what allah has bestowed upon me but than what is given to you by his gift and you is delighted than allah
go back to them we will surely go with them with hosts that they can not resist and we will expel them from the abased and disgrace and they will be abased
he said o council which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in surrender
a stalwart of the sprites said i i will bring it to you before you rise from your place
i am strong and reliable enough to do it
and one who had knowledge of the book i i will bring it to your glance before your lord
when solomon saw it placed before him he said “ is the the of of my lord he he test me whether i give thanks or ungrateful to me
and whoever is grateful is grateful for his sake only whosoever of his own good and
and whoever is ungrateful then know my lord is is free of need
he said disguise for her her throne that we may see whether she will be guided or if she is of those who are not guided
so when she came it was said to her is your throne like this
she said it though it is it
we said to her knowledge and that we have been before her
and prevented her from accepting her that she was worshipping than allah instead of allah belonged to a belonged to the unbelieving people
she was invited enter the enter the
and when she saw it it was pool and bared her legs and she bared her legs
he said verily it is a palace whose floor is made smooth with glass
she said my lord i have wronged myself and i submit with solomon to allah lord of the worlds
and we we sent their brother salih saying worship allah worship allah and the confederates and they were two parties quarrelling
he said o my people why do you impatient for evil evil before
why do you not plead forgiveness s forgiveness ’ so that you may receive mercy
they said we augur ill of you and those with
and said “ o evil augury is with god and you is with your hearts
indeed you are a people being tested ’
and there were nine the city nine men who were causing corruption in the land and did not
they said swear to one another by god by his we will attack him and his family by night and we will surely tell his guardian we we not not destruction of his family and we we are truthtellers
they devised a plot and we too devised a plan while they were not aware
so observe how was the outcome of their plotting we we destroyed them and all people all
so are their houses desolate because of their wrong they they were ruins
verily there is a sign in this for a people who understand
and we saved those who believed and used to fear allah
and lot when he said to his people do you commit commit commit shameless acts with you eyes open
do you approach approach men instead of women
nay you engage in acts of sheer ignorance
but the answer of his people was naught save that they said expel the family of lot from your city they are people who purified themselves clean
so we saved him and his family except for wife we destined her to be of those who stayed behind
and we rained down them a rain
how ruinous was the rain that fell on fell on those who had been warned
say o muhammad saw praise and thanks be to allah and peace be upon him
is allah better or all that partners that you ascribe as partners to allah
do course allah better than him
who created created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you water from the sky for grow and we grow grow grow grow grow
is there a god besides allah
nay but they are a people who ascribe equals to him
who has made the earth a place of rivers and and and and placed rivers and placed it firm mountains and placed a barrier between the two seas
is there a god with god
nay but most of them know not
who who answers the prayer of the distressed when he invokes him to removes the and removes the evil and makes you inheritors
is there a god with god
little is you remember
is he who shows you in the darkness of the land and sea and who sends the winds as heralds of his mercy
is there a god with god
exalted is exalted above what they associate
is he who best who produceth creation and and and who provides for you from the sky and the earth
what is with god with god
say produce your proof if you are truthful
say none in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except allah and they they not aware when they will be resurrected
nay but knowledge fails not in the to in the hereafter life nay it is nay they are in the hereafter
and those who disbelieve say when we have become dust and our fathers shall we be brought forth
we were promised this forsooth so our fathers were before
it is nothing but the fictitious the former peoples
say travel in the land and see how was the end of the criminals
and grieve not grieve over them and do not be troubled by what they they were to plot
and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if ye say sooth
say perhaps perhaps you may be behind you behind
and your lord is full to mankind but most of them do not give thanks
and verily your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they reveal
and there is a thing in the heavens and the earth but it is in a clear book
surely this qur an to the the children of israel most of that concerning which they differ
and verily it is a guidance and a mercy unto the believers
your lord will judge between them by his wisdom
and is is the exalted in might the knowing
so put your trust in allah thou art on the manifest truth
you can not make the dead to hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they have turned their backs retreating
nor can you lead the blind out of their error
you can make only those who believe in our signs and have submitted muslims
and when the word of judgement fulfilment we we will bring forth for them a beast of the earth speaking earth to them the beast of the earth had come to faith to our faith
and remind the day when we shall muster from every nation a large group of those who denied our signs and they will be brought forth
so when they come before before their lord he will say ‘ did you deny me
or what was it that you used to do
the the word of of been fulfilled concerning the which was been fulfilled and and ungodliness
they will not be
do they not see how we have made the night that they may rest in it and the day giving sight
surely there are signs in this for people who believe
and the day when the trumpet is be blown and all the are in the heavens and earth will be terrified except those whom allah will and all be him utterly abject
and you see see the mountains and think them solid solid but passing away above them
that work of allah who perfected all things
he is aware of the things you do
whoso who a good deed reward than the reward
on day day they resurrection they will not coming to the day of resurrection
and whosoever will with evil faces faces shall be cast down into the fire
will you being rewarded for anything but what you used to do
i prophet have been commanded only to serve the the of my lord and has sanctified it and and and i and i and to and i am commanded to be among those who submit to to allah and submit to him in islam
and to recite the qur
so whosoever is rightly guided for his own advantage
and he who say “ i am am one of warners
and say praise all praise unto allah
he will show you his signs and you will recognize them
your lord is not inattentive of what you do
ta seen meem
these are the verses of the illuminating book
we recite to you from the the news of moses and pharaoh awn in truth for those who believe
indeed pharaoh tyrannized himself in the land and made its people into sects oppressing a wall into them and their newborn sons and keeping their females alive
lo he was of those who work corruption
and we desired to favour those who were abased in the land and to make make leaders to make them leaders and inheritors
and to establish them in the land and to show pharaoh and his minister haman and their soldiers
we revealed this this the mother suckle him him him him him him cast him cast down
and they have take a face of the country
we shall bring him back to you and we shall him one of the messengers ones
then the family of pharaoh picked him up of the enemy that he may be an enemy of a and a pharaoh river and haman to their habitual sinners and and guilty of grief and that their hands and and their hands and that their hands and the and
and the wife of fir aun said said will be a comfort for me and for me and
do not kill him
he may be of use to us or we may adopt him as a son
but they were not foresee
the the morning the heart of moses mother became empty
we had not strengthened her heart that she might not strengthened her heart she her heart we would have been taught him the of the believers
she said to his sister follow him
so she watched him from afar and they were unaware
we we had forbidden him to nurse him
so she said “ i i you a household household of that you will rear him him
so we returned him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve and she she might know that promise promise of allah is true but most of them know not
and when he reached his maturity and became established we gave him wisdom and knowledge
thus do we reward the good
and he entered the city at a time when they were in its people and he found it one to the people of the people of his enemies
and he who belonged to his community appealed help against against him who belonged to his enemies
so musa who was a from his followers sought his him
he said this is of the s of satan and verily he is an enemy of misleader
he said my lord i have have wronged myself so forgive me
so he forgave him
so god forgave him for he is the allforgiving the allcompassionate
he said my my lord i me i will be a i never be a partisan of the sinners
in the morning he came to the city fearful and hesitant
so as who had who had who had asked him him to him a day for the destruction of his own
moses said indeed you are in a fellow
and when he wanted to strike the one of the enemy was he was enemy to both to kill you killed someone thou didst kill a person yesterday
you only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not make the the reformers reformers
and a man came from farthest part of the city of the city running said to the o o i i am to you you intending to you to the one of the city sincere advisers
so he left the city vigilant and said “ lord deliver me from the harmdoing nation
and when he betook himself toward madyan he said ‘ it my lord will guide me to way
and when he arrived at the waters of midian he found a crowd of people people drawing water and he found apart from them two women holding back their flocks
he said what aileth you twain with you
they said we can not water water until the shepherds have driven away their flocks and our father is a very man man
so he watered water then then retired to to the shade and said my lord my lord i have need of whatever good you have sent me
then one of the two women approached him walking bashfully
and he saith unto him and and that he is not be him unto thy lord so that he may be a
you have escaped from the people who are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers disbelievers
one of the two women said “ father hire is the best employee for you is is strong and trustworthy
he said i i fain to marry to you of these two daughters of mine on condition that you hirest thyself to me for eight years
i do complete ten that you would be for you
allah willing you will find me a man of righteous
he said that shall be between between me and you whichsoever it is no shall be no harshness to me and i i no is over the the is the the of the things you do
so when he had the term and was traveling with his family he noticed a fire on the side of the mount
he said to his family ‘ wait i have seen a fire
indeed i descry a fire
maybe i will bring you some news from a fire that you may may warm yourselves
when he drew near to the the side of the valley spot from the the the the spot around to the the the i am the the voice of the the lord of the worlds
throw down your staff ”
but when he saw it wriggling as if it were a snake he turned his flight and did not even look back
it nigh said o musa moses
“ o come forth fear fear fear not thou thou art in the ones
put your hand inside your armpit when it come white white without disease to come to illness – and illness to illness – and your lord to your lord to pharaoh two two two when they are two when you are the people are are a lawless ”
moses said o my lord i have killed slain a soul among them and i fear they will slay me
and my brother harun
so send him with a helper to me and as a helper to confirm me and i fear that they will impugn me
he said we will not strengthen your arm with your brother and give you to you with you so they will not be able to harm you
with our signs you you and those who follow you shall be the victors
but when moses came to them with our clear signs they said this is nothing but a magic sorcery
we never heard of this among our fathers the ancients
moses said my lord knows best aware of him who bringeth guidance from him and whose will be be guerdon of guerdon of the abode
the the zalimun polytheists and disbelievers etc will not be successful
pharaoh said said o i know not know that you save me a god other than me so kindle kindle a fire for me a tower that that i may make a look at a look at a look at a luck that i may look at at the
and he and his hosts were stiffnecked in the land without right and they would not be brought back to us
so we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea
so observe thou the the end of the oppressors
and we made them leaders calling to the fire and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
and we made a curse to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection they will be among the exiled
and we gave moses the scripture after we had destroyed the former generations as enlightenment for mankind and and a mercy that that that they might remember
you were not on the western side when we decreed the western side of the mount when we decreed the command nor did you not be witnesses
but we brought forth generations generations and dragged with them them and there came to them the the of madyan midian reciting to them our verses but we were not to you the tales of the
and you were not on the side of the tur when we were but when when thou didst in the mercy that thou mayest warn a people to whom no warner came before you before you so that they may be admonished
and if we decide a them a a of that which had been sent and would have have sent have sent sent messenger to us a messenger and would have been sent to you and we would not believe in the ayat proofs evidences verses lessons signs revelations etc
but when the truth came to them from us they say why he he not been given the like of what was given to moses did they not reject in same
they they disbelieve disbelieve in that which was revealed before before moses and they said “ we are imposters and
say then if what is a book from allah which is a sign from allah and that follow follow the other than it
if if they fail to respond to know know that they are only following their lusts
and who is more astray than he who follows his fancy without guidance from allah
indeed allah not not the wrongdoing people
we have now we have caused them word to reach them in haply they may be
those to whom we gave the book before it believe in it
and when it is recited to them they say we believe in it
it it is the truth from our lord
indeed we were it before it
they will be given their reward twice for they persevered only they repel evil with good and and spend good in what wherewith we have provided them
and when they hear vain vain they they turn away from us and say our our deeds have your deeds
peace be to you
we do not desire ignorant
but can not guide whom you will not guide whom you will never guide whomever you wishes
they say if we follow the guidance with thee we shall be snatched from our land land
have we not established for them a safe sanctuary whereunto fruits all all kinds of all from them
but most of them do not know
and how many a town have we destroyed that was thankless for its means
and yonder are their dwellings which have been been inhabited after them except for a little while
we have been the inheritors
and never would thy lord destroy the cities until he had raised a mother a messenger messenger mother a messenger reciting to them our verses
we never have destroyed cities unless their inhabitants were people people
and whatsoever ye are vouchsafed unto the life of the world and the adornment thereof and the adornment thereof and that which is is with allah is better and more lasting
will you not exercise your reason
is he to whom we have promised a good promise which he will obtain him like him whom we have given him enjoyment of the life of the day of resurrection
and remember the day when he will call to them and say where are my partners that you used to claim ”
those against whom the sentence will be been just as those those those say say we perverted them as their ones whom we led astray astray from us we we ourselves and we were unconcerned with them
and it will be said to help help for help
and they will call upon them but they will not answer them
so will call upon them but they will not answer they will they had they had guided
and day he will call them them “ what what did you give the messengers ”
and the day all news will be blinded for them so they will not be able to ask one another
but as for him who repents and believes and does good deeds he shall be among the prosperers
your lord lord creates what he wills and chooses chooses
they have they have any choice
too holy and high above what they associate with him
and your lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they reveal
and he is allah there is no god but him his is the praise in the former and in the latter and the is the the him and to him will be returned
say have you considered if allah made the night perpetual for you until the day of resurrection what god other than god could bring you light
hearken ye not hear
say have you considered if allah made the day for day perpetual day of resurrection what god other than god can bring you night for you can not bring you you night for you will not you perceive not
it is out of his mercy he made appointed for you night and day for you that you may rest in it and the day and that you may be grateful
and the day when he will call to them and say where are my partners whom you were wo nt to assert
and we shall draw out from every nation a witness and say produce your proof
then they will realize that the truth is allah s and the will they used to invent
korah was was of moses people but he began to oppress them
we had given him treasures keys would would have a a difficulty
his people said to him do not exult allah does not love the boastful
and seek the the of what which allah has given you and your own good and do not forget to the good of the world to the the earth and do not seek the cause of the good you you allah has not the like of the and allah
he said i have been given it this on me of that i possess
did he not know that allah had destroyed before him generations more than him who were stronger than him and larger in the
and the culprits will not be asked about their sins
so he emerged before his people in his pomp those who desired the life of the world said ah would that we had had like of what korah has been given
he he is a of fortune fortune
but those endowed with knowledge said woe to you
the reward of allah is better for those who believe and act righteously
and none attains it except those who are patient
so we caused the earth to swallow him and his mansion and he who had no him against him against him nor was he who was helpless to help him except allah nor was able to defend him
and morning found who had wished his place place in yesterday began to say ah
allah enlargeth the provision for whom he will of his slaves and straiteneth it for whom he will
had allah not shown us favor he would have made us to be swallowed too
ah the infidels thrive not
that is the last abode we shall assign it for those who do not exorbitance in the earth nor corruption
and the end is for the muttaqun pious see v 2 2
whosoever bringeth a good deed shall have better than it and whoso bringeth evil evil deed shall be repaid to evil evil deeds shall be be recompensed for what they did
he who has has ordained the qur an you you will surely bring you home to the best
say thou my lord knoweth best who bringeth guidance and who is in manifest error
and you not not expecting that book would be given you but except for the truth so be not be a supporter of the mercy from your lord
let them not bar them the the of allah after they have been sent down to you
and call to your lord and never be of the polytheists
and do not invoke another god with god there is no god except him
there is no god but he
everything will be save him
his is the judgment to him will you will be returned
alif lam meem
do the think that they will be left alone say “ we believe ”
we assuredly tested those before them and so that god will surely test those liars
or do those who do evil deeds think they can outrun us
evil is what they judge
whoever looks forward to the meeting with allah meeting with allah coming coming coming coming of the coming
and is allhearing allknowing
and whosoever strives striveth only for himself
verily is altogether in of the worlds
and those who believe and do righteous deeds we will remit their sins and their misdeeds and shall remit from of the best of what they used to do
we have have enjoined upon man kindness to parents
but if they urge you to associate with me that which you have no knowledge do not obey them
to me is your return and i will inform you about what you used to do
and those who believe and do good works we we shall admit them among the righteous
among the people are those who say we believe in allah but when he is harmed in the cause of allah he makes the persecution of the persecution of the s punishment ’
and if help comes from your lord they say say we were with you
is not allah best aware of what is in the breasts of the creatures
allah allah knows those who believe and he will surely make known to
and the the of those who say to our lord follow our our path
and have not for the the of the
they can not bear aught of their sins
they are indeed liars
they found found our their own who conferred on by their own
on day day will will will be of of them
and indeed we sent noah to his people and he among them a thousand years but fifty years inviting them while they were wrongdoers
and we saved him and the people of the ark and made it a sign for the worlds
and we sent sent to abraham he said to his people worship allah and fear him
that is better for you if you understand
you serve instead of allah only idols and you invent falsehoods
those whom you worship other than allah have no power to give you provision
and ask allah for forgiveness of allah
so seek the provision of allah and give thanks to him
to thanks to him him you will be returned
if if you deny the message of the nations before you
the messenger is only to convey the message plainly
see they not see how produceth creation then reproduceth it
say travel in the land and see how allah originated the creation then then makes to the second growth to allah is powerful over everything
he punishes whom he will and shows mercy mercy on whom he will and to him you will be returned
and you will not cause failure to the earth or the the heaven nor the earth
none can protect you from than allah any protector or any helper
those who disbelieve in the verses of allah and his meeting with him despair of my mercy mercy
for such there is a painful punishment
but the answer of his people was that that kill him or burn him ”
but allah delivered him from the fire
there are indeed signs in that for a people who have faith
he said ‘ you have taken up idols instead of allah so that bond love love of the world instead of the world life on the day of resurrection and disown another people and curse one another
your refuge is the fire and you will have none to come to aid
so lut believed in him and said i migrate migrate my lord lord the almighty the wise
and we gave him abraham isaac and jacob and placed on the descendants of ya qub jacob and the
we gave him his wage in this world and in the everlasting life he will be among the righteous
and lot when he said to his people “ you commit commit such indecency as none has preceded you in the worlds
what do you go men and males and cut your way and commit in your gatherings gatherings ”
then the only answer of his people was but say “ bring us s punishment ’ if you are truthful ”
he said “ my lord help me against the people of corruption ”
and when our messengers came to abraham with the good tidings they said we we are not going to destroy the people of that town that town that town indeed its people are zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers
he said “ yet lot is in
they said ‘ we know better for those who are
we will surely deliver him and his family except for wife she is of those who remain behind
and when our messengers came to lot he was troubled on embarrassed on their account and felt troubled troubled
they said have no fear and regret
we we save save and your family except your your wife she will remain remain behind
we we are about to bring down upon the people of this city a scourge from the sky because of what they were been transgressing
and we have left a clear sign a sign a clear sign for a people who use reason
and to midian their brother shu aib
he said worship allah my nation
look the the last day
do not make mischief in the land doing corrupt works
but they denied him and the earthquake seized them and they found them prostrate in their dwellings
and we tribes of a ad and thamud
satan satan had made their deeds seem to them and turned them from from the right path although they were intelligent
and we destroyed qarun and fir and haman
and assuredly came unto them with clear proofs but they were stiffnecked and the were boastful
each of them we seized by his sin
so we struck by a blast hurling a blast blast and we blast and we we we seized by a blast and the earth and swallow up swallow up a lie on them
it was not for them to wrong them but themselves they wronged themselves
the parable of those who take others than allah is as the likeness of the spider who takes the a house the weakest house of the spider s house if they weakest house of the spider s house if they but knew
allah knows whatever thing they invoke besides him he is the allmighty the allwise
and these examples we we present them the people but none understands them except those who know
allah created the heavens and the earth in truth
surely in that is a sign for the believers
“ and recite the book has been been been and keep prayer and be dutiful towards the and and turn towards him and turn towards him
and the remembrance of is greater
allah knows all that you do
and do not the the the the the the middle of the book except those who those who have with their hearts and those who do not right with them with their right and and is with your right hand
then do not take with your course of you which you you
and if you had believed you believe in which was revealed to you and been been book and been and we had been sent down to you and we had we had been sent down to you and we have been muslims
but only him is the one of us and i am only a surrender
and thus we have sent down to you the book
those to whom we gave the scripture before believe in it and some thereof believe in it
and renounce our communications except the infidels
and thou o muhammad wast not any scripture with inscribe before it with the right hand those who have been right hand for the impugners would have doubted
in fact is the clear verses in the chests of the who have been given knowledge
no one renounce our signs except the unjust
but they say “ has has sent sent down to him from his lord ”
say “ the are are only with allah
i am only a warner plain plain simple
is it not enough for them that we have sent down to you the book which is recited to them
there is indeed a mercy and a reminder for a people who believe
say god suffices as a witness between me and you
he knows what is in the heavens and the earth
those who believe in in falsehood and disbelieve in allah those are the losers
and demand you to hasten the punishment
and had not been for a specified appointed punishment would have have been upon them
and surely it will come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
they demand that you hasten the punishment
and indeed hell will the unbelievers
on the day when the punishment envelopes cover them from above them and from below their feet and he will say taste what flavour of your deeds
o my servants who believe surely my earth is wide so serve me alone
every soul shall taste death and then to us you shall be returned
and those who believe and do good works we shall give them into elevated of paradise elevated rivers whereunder rivers flow
how excellent the guerdon of the toilers
who persevere and are patient and put their trust in their lord
how many many living creature on the earth its sustenance and he provides for them and he is the all of everything
if you asked them “ who created the heavens and the earth and has disposed the sun and the moon they would say ‘ allah
why then are they deviate
allah enlarges the provision of whom he wills of his servants and restricts it
indeed allah has knowledge of all things
if if you come to them a new life and the water the earth after it had come water
say ‘ all praise praises and thanks be to allah ”
do not argue them according to allah allah and they they not not
and this life of the world is nothing but sport and play
it is surely the home of the hereafter if only they knew
and when they board the ship they supplicate allah sincere to him in religion
but when he brings them to to the land once they associate others with him
so they to be ungrateful for what we have given them and they will soon they will soon know
have they not seen that we have a safe sanctuary while all around them people are around them
do they believe believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the bounty of allah
and who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against allah or denies the truth when it has come to him
is there not a resort in hell for the disbelievers
as for those who strive in us we will surely guide them to our paths
and verily allah is with the muhsinun
alif lam meem
the byzantines have been defeated
in the nearer land and after their defeat will be victorious
in three to nine years
all command belongs to allah before and before the day the will will be
the the help of allah he he he will
he is the the allmighty the most merciful
the promise of promise of allah
allah fails not his promise but most of do not know
they know an outward part of the life of the world and they are they are inattentive
do they not reflect deeply in their ownselves should not created the heavens and the earth and all that between them except with truth and for a term term
and indeed many of the deny in the meeting with their lord
have they not travelled through the earth earth so that they might observe how was in their in their dwellings in them and in tilled
they were stronger than these in power and they dug the earth and built more more than than than they built built
their apostles brought them manifest proofs
it was not for them to wrong them but themselves they wronged themselves
then evil was the end of those who did evil of the they denied the signs of allah and they mock of them
allah originates creation then brings it back again then to him you shall be returned
and on the day when the hour will be established the criminals will be dumbfounded
and they they whom they ascribed partners to him they will disbelieve in their partners
on the day when the hour will come to pass that day they will be separated
as for those who believed and did good works they shall be in a garden
but as for those who disbelieved and denied our oneness of the meeting of the hereafter and the hereafter will be be brought to be brought to hell
so exalt allah when the evening and when the night and the morning
his is the praise in the heavens and the earth and in the noontide hour
he brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and revives the earth after its death
even so will you be brought forth
and of his signs is that he created you from dust then lo ye are humankind spreading yourselves
and of his signs is that he created for you from your wives from yourselves yourselves that you may find comfort in them and he affection between you and mercy
there are indeed signs in this for those who reflect
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variety of your tongues and colours
surely in that are signs for all for all things
and of his signs is your sleeping during night and your seeking his his and and the day to people who ponder
and of his signs is that he shows you the arousing fear and hope and and the water from the sky and with quickeneth the sky and the earth after its death
there are indeed signs in that for a people who exercise their reason
and of his signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by his command and then when he calls you you from the when when you will come forth
and to him belong all those who are in the heavens and the earth all are submissive to him
he is he who who brings you then he will and then will he will will be be
that is a for for
his is the sublime similitude in the heavens and the earth is comparable to him
he is the mighty the wise
he draws you for you an yourselves from yourselves in order that you have some of your own and and have have have a degree on you and you have have your hands possess as though we have have you you in it for you
but the the wicked follow their own desires without knowledge
who then will guide him whom allah has sent astray
and will have no helpers
so set thy exclusively face the true religion uprightly of pure man from the he originated the the creation
adhere to the fitrah of allah upon whom he has created
this is the supreme law
that is the true religion but most people do not know
say o
you are you are commanded
and fear god and keep fearing fear of allah
of those who split up their religion and became sects each faction in what they have
when affliction befalls mankind they supplicate to any misfortune befalls them they cry unto their lord penitently turning to him
then then when he lets them taste mercy from them behold they ascribe partners to their lord
so as to deny what we have given them
take your enjoyment for you will soon know
or have sent down any authority so that which speaks in support of what they have been associating with him
when we give people taste taste of mercy they rejoice at it
but when adversity befalls them because of what they hands have perpetrated they begin to despair
do they not see that allah enlarges the provision for whom he wills and restricts it
there are indeed signs in that for a people who have faith
so give to the kindred his due and to the needy and to the the traveler
that is best for those who seek the s countenance and those they they are the blissful ones
and you give in interest in order that it may not be charitable to allah and not increase not the allah with allah
as for those in the in this world and good in the way of
allah is allah who created you and then you you you then he makes you die then he you to life
is there any of your partners ‘ does any of of that
can any of your associates do any of that
exalted is exalted above what they associate
corruption has appeared in land and sea because of what men have earned and some people of that they may done some of what they have earned and allah so that they may return to the people
say travel muhammad saw the land and see how was the end of those before you
most of them were associators of others with allah
so set your attention towards the true religion before that day comes the true day from the day day come from the day is be sundered
whoever disbelieves upon him is the consequence of his disbelief
and whoever does righteousness they are for themselves preparing
so that he may reward those who have faith and do righteous deeds out of his grace
he he does not love the ungrateful
and of his signs is that he looses the winds as bearers of glad tidings to taste his taste his mercy and that you may sail at his command and that you may seek of his bounty and that you may be thankful
we sent before you o muhammad to their people who were brought their clear signs
then we retributed vengeance upon those who acted wickedly
it is incumbent on us to help the believers
it is allah who sendeth the winds so that they raise the clouds spreadeth them along the sky as he causeth it to the sky and he break it into the rain issuing from the sky
then when he rain it fall upon whom he will of his servants they rejoice
though before that they were sent down upon them before that they were in despair
look then at the marks of s mercy how how he revives quickeneth the earth after its death
that he is the reviver of the dead and he is over to all things
and if we send a wind and they see it yellow they would they would would become ungrateful
so you can not make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs retreating
nor can you guide the blind out of their error
you can make none to hear except those who believe in our signs and have submitted
it is allah who created you weak weakness then after weakness gave you strength strength then after after strength gave you weakness and gray hair
he creates what he wills
he is allknowing allpowerful
and on the day when the hour will come to them the wicked they will swear that they were not deceived
but those who were been faith and faith will say to them remained in the book of allah until allah will protected tablets till the day of resurrection
this is the day of resurrection but you did not know
so that day the excuses will not benefit those who did wrong nor will they be suffered to appease allah
and have we have set forth for mankind in this qur an kind of parable
but if you bring them bring them sign the unbelievers will say will say “ you are nothing but a
even so allah seals the hearts of those who know not
say o
the s promise ’ is is true
and do not let yourself be upset by those who have not conviction
alif lam meem
these are the verses of the wise book
a guidance and a mercy for the righteous
those who establish the iqamatas salat and give the poorrate and are certain in faith
those are on guidance guidance from their lord and it is they who are the felicitous
among the people is he who buys the distracting tales intending to lead people from the way of allah without knowledge and takes it s way to ridicule
for such there is a shameful punishment
and when our verses are recited to him he turns away his stiffneckedness as though he heard them not hear though though there were a deafness in his ears
give glad tidings of a painful punishment
as for those who believe and do good deeds for them are gardens of delight
there they will abide for ever
it is a promise of allah in truth
he is the the allmighty the allwise
he created the heavens without any visible supports and cast into the earth so that you may see it into it and scattered and scattered throughout it and scattered
and we send down water from the sky and we make grow therein therein plants of every noble
this is the creation of allah
now show me what those besides him have created
nay the wrongdoers are in clear error
we we wisdom we luqman enjoining “ give up allah
whoever is appreciative — is grateful for the benefit of his own good
and whoever is ungrateful — allah is allsufficient rich and wants worthy of all praise
and when lokman said to his son admonishing him o my son do not associate anything with allah in associate others with allah in his divinity
and we have enjoined on man man his mother his mother bore him in weakness and his weaning is in two years give thanks to me and to me parents and to your parents finally towards me is the goal
but if they strive with you to associate with me that which you have no knowledge knowledge obey them not obey them
consort with them in the world kindly and follow the path of him who turns to me
to me you shall return and i will inform you of what you used to do
o my my son if it should be a weight of a mustardseed and it a rock or in the heavens or in the earth or in the earth or in it
verily is kind and expert
o my son establish the prayer and bid to honour and forbid dishonour
it is with the the that the matters of that quran that is to allah
these are indeed the steadiest of courses
do not not treat the people with arrogance in contempt and do not walk exultantly on the earth
verily allah does not like any swaggering braggart
be modest in your bearing and lower your voice
lo the harshest of all voices is the voice voice of the ass
do you not see that allah has subjected subject to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and has completed his favors upon you and he has given you the hearts
yet of mankind is he who disputeth concerning allah without knowledge or guidance or a book giving light
and when it is said to them follow what allah has revealed they say nay we we follow that which we found our fathers upon
even if satan is calling them to the punishment of the blaze
whoever surrenders himself to to allah and he is a doer of good handle
unto allah belongeth the the of all things
so let the unbelief of unbelief unbeliever not grieve you
to us is their return and we will inform them about what they used to do
allah is aware of what is in the breasts
we give them enjoyment for a little while then a them to them a harsh punishment
and if you asked them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say “ allah ”
say all the praises and thanks be to allah but most of them know not
to allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
he is the rich the praised
if all the trees in the earth were pens and the sea with ink seven more seas were not seven more supply the words of allah would not be exhausted
indeed is is allmighty allwise
your creation and your resurrection as as as the as you are only a single soul
indeed is allhearing allseeing seeing
have you not see that allah merges the night to the day and merges the day into the night and the day to the
and he has harnessed sun and the moon each running its course for a
allah is aware of what you do
that is because allah is the truth and because they call upon other than him
surely allah is allhigh and supreme
do you not see that the ship sails on the sea by allah s grace ’ that he may show you some of his signs
there are indeed signs in every persevering grateful provide
and when waves cover them like them they they they they are only to god making their religion sincerely his but when he brings them safely to the
no one renounces our signs except the ungrateful blasphemer
o people fear your lord and dread the day when no father shall give satisfaction for his child nor will not satisfaction for the child nor will not avail them at the least nor will the the the the the the deceiver deceived you
lo allah alone the the the hour
and he knoweth the goes shall shall be no and he knoweth what the wombs and he sendeth down the morrow and he knoweth that which is in the and he knoweth that which is in the
surely allah is allknowing allaware
alif lam meem
the revelation of the book is without doubt from the the lord of the worlds
do they say he he has fabricated it
in fact it is the truth from your lord so that you may warn a people to whom you admonisher was sent before you
they may haply come to guidance
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then he established himself on the throne
you have no guardian or intercessor other than him
will you not remember
he governs the all from the heaven to the earth and in goes up in in a governance then in a thousand years by your years
that is the knower of the invisible and the visible the almighty the most merciful
who who excelled in exceeding he he he he he he originated the creation of man from clay
then he made his progeny from a extract of a base fluid
then he shaped him and breathed into him of his spirit
he gave you you hearing and and sight and little thanks you thank
and they say when we are mingled with the earth shall we be be created anew
nay but they deny the meeting with their lord
say the angel of death who has been given you will gather you then you will be your lord your lord you shall be returned
and you you see see when they are being before their lord lord lord lord lord we have seen and heard and we have seen
so send us back
we are the right right
and we we we we would not have given every soul its guidance but the word of my word truth and i will fill hell with the and and jinn and the people who were not the
so taste the punishment for your forgetting the encounter of this day day
we we you you you the you
taste the the punishment of immortality because of what you used to do
only those believe in our signs who when they are reminded of them fall down in prostration and proclaim the praise of their lord and praising him and do not wax proud
their sides forsake their couches they supplicate to their lord in fear and hope and expend of what we have bestowed them them
no one knows what is the the joy of joy comfort as much good for them for what they used to do
is someone who is faithful like someone who is a sinner
they are not alike
as for those who believe and do good works for them are the gardens of of hospitality for that they used to do
but as for those who defiantly evil their refuge is hell
every time they to emerge from it they will be returned back to it and said to them taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny
and we we make them taste the nearer punishment before the greater punishment so that they may return
and who is more wrong than he who is reminded of his lord s his turns turns away from them
we we shall exact retribution from the criminals
we gave gave the book book so moses so that we have not a a sign for the children of israel and it it a guidance
and we appointed from among them leaders guiding by our command when they endured patiently and and our our command
your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they have been differing
is it not a guidance to them how many generations we destroyed before them in whose dwelling places they walk walk
there are indeed signs in that
will they not then hear
do they not see that we drive the water to the parched land and bring forth crops crops which they they themselves eat themselves and cattle
will they not see
they say “ when will this this victory if you should be truthful
say them the the day of decision the faith will not benefit benefit those who disbelieve will be their nor will they be granted
so turn away from them and wait they are waiting
o prophet fear allah and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites
god is allknowing and wise
follow that which is revealed to you from your lord
indeed allah is fully aware of what you do
and put your trust in allah allah suffices as a guardian
allah has not made for any hearts to be in his hearts
neither has he made your wives whom you declare unlawful that you your mothers azzihar you azzihar to you your azzihar
that is it matter with your own mouths
god speaks the truth and he guides to the right way
call them real their fathers
that is more just with allah
if if you know not their fathers then they are your brethren in religion and your clients
and there is no sin for you in mistakes but that which you have unintentionally but only what is your hearts
and is allforgiving allcompassionate
the believers muslims the faithful when they have believed
and is not concerned with the is is the
the the two of the two other than that other than one of the man between the two three
this was for their predecessors the holy makkah which we have given the book to whom we have given you inherit the land of allah
it is for you on the and the the the book you you you you you you you you you you you
and when we took a pledge from the prophets and we took with with you a covenant and we noah and abraham and jesus son son of mary
so that he may ask the truthful about their sincerity and the sincerity and the conveyance of the unbelievers
believers remember the favor of allah to you when hosts came to you and armies came against them a wind and forces you you from you
we unleashed against them a wind and hosts angels did not see
and allah is ever seer of what you do
when they came upon you from above you and from below you and when eyes eyes rolled wild you and hearts leapt to the throats and you entertained of doubts about allah
there the believers were tried and shaken shaken a severe agitation
and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease were saying allah and his messenger promised promised nothing delusion
and when a group of them said “ o people of yathrib you you are here so keep on for ”
then certain certain of band asked of them for the prophet saying our homes lie open enemy

o prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers of the night and they their bodies of their outer garments
that is more suitable that they will be recognised and not not be abused
and is is forgiving merciful
if the hypocrites and those in whose hearts there is a sickness and the scandal mongers in madinah do not desist we shall make you overpower them then they shall not urge you to a little while
accursed wherever found they will be seized and slain with a relentless slaughter
such has been allah s precedent ’ with those who passed away before
you will find no change in allah s system ’
the people question you concerning the hour
say ‘ the knowledge of it is with allah
perhaps the hour is near
allah has cursed the unbelievers and has prepared for them a blazing fire
they they abide for ever they will find neither protector nor a helper
the day when the faces are be turned about in the fire they will say “ would that we had obeyed allah and obeyed the messenger
they will say “ our lord we obeyed our masters and great ones and they misled us away from the way
our lord give them a punishment and curse them with a mighty curse
o you who believe
allah cleared him of what they said
he was distinguished with allah
o you who believe fear allah and speak sound statements
he will set your deeds for for you and will forgive you your sins

allah will the the believers that the hypocrites and the hypocrite men and women and the idolaters and the believers and women alike and men and believing men and believing women
and is everforgiving most merciful
praise is to allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth
and praise praise praise and to him the the is in the hereafter and he is the the the
he knows whatsoever which into the earth and whatsoever cometh forth therefrom and whatsoever descendeth from the heaven and whatsoever ascendeth thereto
he is the merciful the most forgiving
those who disbelieve say the hour will not come to us
say yes by by my lord it will come to you
and of the atom of of the hidden from from the heaven and the is hidden
no that no less than that it in it clear record
that he may recompense those who believe and do good works
for such there will be forgiveness and a generous provision
but those who strive against our signs seeking to frustrate failure purpose for them is a painful punishment
and those who have been given knowledge see that what is been sent down to you from your lord is the truth and guides guides the the path of the mighty the praiseworthy
those who disbelieve say shall we direct you to a man who will tell you that when you have become dust then will be raised to life again
has he fabricated a lie against allah or is he insane ”
rather those who do not believe in the hereafter are in in the torment and far error
have they not see what lies before them and what lies behind them of the heaven and the earth
if we will we can make the earth cave or earth or or heaven fall down on them sky fall down
there is is a sign in this for every penitent servant
we we gave david a grace from us and o with the birds and birds echo him with iron him ”
saying make thou long coats of mail and and thou links links thereof
and you eat and and do good and do good
i am seer of what you do
and to sulaiman we subjected the wind its morning course was a month s journey and its evening course was a month s journey
we made the fount of molten brass to flow for him by his permission of his lord
and of them jinn swerved from our command we we them taste of the punishment of the blazing fire
they made for him whatsoever he willed synagogues and statues rooms images basins as large <unk> and the the cauldrons
work thanks o family of dawud david
few of my slaves are thankful
then when we decreed death for him nothing indicated to death to them except a creature creature of the eating eating his his staff
and when he fell down the jinn realised that had known the sprites they would not have continued in the realm beyond perception
for sheba there was a sign sign sign
in in their dwelling their brothers on were right and to right right side of the
a good your you and a forgiving
but we turned away away from his and
so we have loose upon them the of the dam and their of arim dam and their gardens and tamarisks and a few lotetrees
thus we recompensed them for their unbelief and we we shall recompense the unbeliever
between them and the towns we had blessed we had blessed towns and we spaced the stage between them
move travel between them them night and night in safety
but they said “ our lord make the distance of our journeys longer
they wronged themselves so we them history and we scattered them in total directions tales
there are are signs in for for for everyone who grateful grateful person
satan was correct in them assessment of them
they followed him except for him a group of the faithful
and he had no authority over them except except we distinguish the who who who who believes in the hereafter and him who is doubtful about it
your lord is guardian over everything
say o muhammad those whom you assert other gods besides allah
they do not masters atom s weight in the heavens and the earth nor do they have a partnership in either nor is them among them any supporters or them
no intercession avails with him except his his allows so that any man of his servants
so then do you that the way of allah which you you his his his his you can
and when they are asked their fright they will say what what your lord has lord has ’
they will say the truth
and he is the most high the great
say “ who provides for you from the heavens and the earth
say allah
say either we or you are upon guidance or in manifest error
say you will not be questioned about our sins nor will we be asked about what you do
say our lord will bring us all together then he will judge between us with truth
he is the <unk> the allknowing judge
say ‘ show me me those whom you have joined to him as partners
no no means aye
rather he is allah the mighty the wise
we have not sent you o muhammad except for a bearer of good tidings and a warner and a people who know not
and they say when is this promise if if you are truthful
say ‘ you is the day when you can not postpone by a single hour nor can forward forward forward
the unbelievers say “ we never believe in this koran nor in what was before it nor in it
if only you could see when the wrongdoers will stand before their lord casting the who were casting another believers who will say to those who were arrogant weak and arrogant were arrogant we we we would not have been believers
those who were arrogant will say to those who were deemed weak did we we you you from guidance after it had come to you
no you were sinners
those who were abased will say to those who were arrogant “ rather it was scheming night and day when you prompted us to forswear allah and to us to us
and they see the punishment they will express repentance
we we shall put iron collars round the necks of infidels
will they be requited for what they used to do
we we sent a herald of warning to us but we warner in its affluent ones said said we we disbelieve in that you are been sent
and they say we have more than you and children and we are not going to be tormented
say “ my lord extends provision for whomever he wills and restricts it but most of men do not know
it guiding a for you that you you
it is only who believed and islamic monotheism and do righteous good deeds righteousness that shall be a twofold reward for them and and they who do righteous good deeds that they are the righteous
and those who strive against our signs seeking to frustrate their purpose they shall be brought to the punishment
say o my lord extends provision for whom he will of his servants and withholds his him
and whatever thing you spend in the cause of allah he will compensate it
and the the day when he will muster them all together then say to the angels was it these these worshipped you worship
they will say hallowed be thou thou
you are our wali other than they have worshipped
most of them believe in them
so today none will possess no power to profit or harm
and we will say to those who did wrong “ taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny ”
and when our signs are recited to them they say this is naught but a man from to you you to say to them but fathers fathers worshipping and say “ this is nothing but that they say this is nothing but lie
and those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth come unto them this is naught but a magic
and we gave given them them scriptures which they had not studying nor sent before them
those who have denied denied had been them attained a tithe of what they had been tenth of what they had denied my my messengers how terrible was my rebuttal
say i give you a single thing that you stand up allah one one and you reflect there is no madness in your companion and reflect there is no madness in the comrade
he is only a warner to you before the advent of a severe punishment
say whatever payment i have asked of you is yours
my reward is only with god
he is witness over all things
say “ my lord projects the truth
knower of the unseen
say truth has come come
falsehood has come falsehood originates falsehood originates and
say if i err astray err only to my own loss and if i am guided guided it because i am what what is revealed to me
he is allhearing and
and if you see see when they will be forced into a terror from terror from going to escape
they shall will be seized from a nearby place
they they say “ we have believed therein
but how can they attain from from from a distant place
they have disbelieved in it before the past shooting a a a from the invisible
and a barrier is set between them and what they desire as was done with their likes
they were in disturbing doubt
all praise be to allah the originator of the heavens and the earth who appointed the angels messengers messengers possessing wings two three or four
he adds to creation what he pleases
indeed allah has power over all things
whatever mercy of allah can withhold it mankind and whatever he withholds none can withhold it and he none none can release it
he is the the allmighty the allwise
o mankind remember the favours of allah to you
is there any creator other than allah who provides for you from the sky and the earth
there is no god but he
so is then you misled
and if they belie you o muhammad saw have been before denied before you
to allah all matters are returned
o people
this is the life of this world
and let the the of allah and he let let the you beguile you from the way of allah
surely satan is an enemy to you so treat him as an enemy
he only invites his faction to be owners of the flaming fire
those who disbelieve theirs there is severe severe punishment and those who believe and do good deeds for them is pardon great reward
then someone is the evil of of him made attractive to him so he regards it as good good good good
god leads whosoever he astray and whomsoever he will and he will
so do not fret yourself to waste sorrowing for them
indeed is aware of what they do
allah is he who sends the winds that raise the clouds
then we drive them out of the land to life and that we revive the earth after it death
such is the resurrection
whosoever desires honour power against allah allah all honour belongs all altogether
to him belongs the word and word and and by the allhearer the and
and is the hearing of the evil and he is the
but for those who plot evil deeds theirs will be a severe punishment and their plotting will be annulled
allah created you from dust then from a spermdrop then he made you pairs
no female conceives or bringeth forth except with his knowledge
and no aged person is granted additional thing nor is is but in is in a register
that that is easy for god
and the two seas are not alike this fresh thirst quenching pleasant to drink and that saltish and bitter
and yet from each you eat fresh meat and derive the ornaments that you wear
and you see the ships cleaving through it that that you may seek of his bounty and that you may give thanks
he makes the night into the day and makes the day to enter the night and he regulates the sun and the moon
that is allah your lord to him belongs the sovereignty
such is allah your lord the him
and those whom you invoke instead of him not create a or a
if you invoke them they hear not hear your supplication and if they heard they would not answer you
and on the day of resurrection they will disown your worshipping
none can tell you like he who is the aware
o people you are the poor allah is the independent absolute the needing anything the all wants and he is the all the alllaudable
if he will he can put you away and bring a new creation
and that is not difficult for allah
and whoever errs only errs against another
if if one laden bears another is be carried to the load of it shall be carried even if he be a a near
you can only those who fear their lord in secret and establish prayer
he who purifies himself purifies himself for his own good and his his soul
to allah is the final destination
the blind and the seeing are not alike
nor are alike darkness darkness
nor shade and torrid torrid heat
and are the equal with the
the are are the believers are the and the not the the truth and do not the in the everlasting life
verily allah makes to he listeth to hear but you can not make those who are in graves
you are only a warner
we have sent you with the truth a bearer of good news and a warner
and there there no nation but a warner came passed
if they belie you lie to those before them also belied the messengers came to them with clear proofs and scriptures psalms and the book book
then i seized the who disbelieved and how terrible was my denial
do you not see that allah sends down water rain from the sky and we produce therewith fruits of varying colours and and streaks streaks of divers and red of varying colours and others and streaks of varying colours and
and human beings and beasts and cattle diverse are likewise hues hues are are
only among his servants among his servants who have knowledge
verily allah is allmighty in might and forgiving
indeed those who recite the book of allah and establish prayer and spend in the cause of allah and we have provided them secretly and publicly expect a trade that will not perish
he he will pay them in full their wages and enrich them from his bounty
he is is forgiving forgiver
and we have revealed to you o muhammad saw the book the the truth confirming what was before it
indeed is is of his servants allseeing
then we made the the the inheritors of those who we chose of our creatures and we chose them for our bondmen and he who gave them our of our deeds and we them them are the them of them are the and and the earth are dead
that inheritance the great bounty
they of eden which they enter wearing they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be of silk
and they will say all praise praises and thanks be to allah who has removed from us all grief
surely our lord is allforgiving allthankful rewarding
who of his grace has installed us in in mansion of eternity us us us us us us us us us us us
and for those who disbelieve the be the fire of hell
it is not decreed to them nor die nor shall its punishment be lessened of it nor will they be
thus do we recompense every ungrateful one
they they cry for help ‘ our lord
release us us we we will act righteously good deeds that we do not be righteous
‘ did we not give you a enough to to long enough to to those who wanted to practice admonition
and the warner came to you
so have a taste of the punishment
the may will have no helper
lo allah is the knower of the unseen of the heavens and the earth
he he is the knower of the the in the breasts
it is he who made you successors on the earth
so disbelieves his disbelief shall recoil him his consequence
the unfaith of the faithless does not increase them with their their their unbelief and their sight of their lord
say ‘ tell me considered those you you apart from what show me what you have created you of the earth have created
or have they any share in the heavens
or have we given them a book so they act on clear proof therefrom
in fact the promise promise each one another except but but delusions
god holds the heavens and the earth lest they cease
and they vanish none would hold them in after after them and he is a guardian
he is is clement and forgiving
and they swore by allah their strongest oaths oaths that if a warner were they would be more guided than any other than a
yet when a warner came to them it only increased them in aversion
behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting of the plotting of evil
but evil evil plot encompasses only those who do not
then can they expect anything else the sunnah way of dealing with you find not find any change in the way of dealing
have they not travelled through the earth and they see the end of those before them who were before them and they were in mightier in these
allah is not such that aught in the heavens and the earth
he is allknowing allpowerful
if allah were to take people for task for what they have earned he would not leave a single living creature on the earth but he will deferring them to a term appointed
but their time comes them when their term will come observes his his servants
yasin these letters are one of the miracles of the quran and none but allah alone knows their meanings
by the wise qur an
you are art of the sent ones
on a straight path
this is of the book the most is the most merciful
that you may warn a people whose ancestors were not warned so they are heedless
indeed surely the have been given the most of them do not believe
we have not that them the best of
we have placed on their necks up necks up
we we have put them and them and they they not put them
and the the of the is in the sight are not a blind blind
and it is alike to them whather thou warnest them or warnest them not they will not believe
you warnest only him who follows the remembrance and fears the merciful of secret unseen
so give him to good news of forgiveness and a generous reward
we is we who who bring the dead to life and write what they have forwarded ahead of their deeds and traces which they behind
we have encompassed that account in a clear register
and for them a parable to the people of the village when the messengers came to it
when sent sent to them two apostles they impugned both of them
then we reinforced them with a third and they said “ we have been sent to you ”
they said “ are are only humans beings ourselves than us are not sent down anything you you are are are are ”
they said our lord lord knows that we have indeed been sent to you
and it is only for us to deliver a clear message ”
they said “ indeed we consider you you a a omen
if you desist not desist we will stone you and will will visit you from punishment punishment
they said your evil augury be with you
is it because you were reminded
but you are a people people
then a man came running from the furthest part of the city running said my people follow the follow the messengers
follow those who ask not ask any wage any you and payment
why did i not that that me and him him whom i have created me
to to you you will be returned
shall i take other gods instead of him
if the merciful leave me harm for their intercession will they be able to harm me nor can they be able to rescue me
in that case i would be in manifest error
lo
i have believed in your lord so hear me
it was said to him enter in the places and if only my people knew
that was my lord has forgiven me and made me of the honored
and we did not send down any army people after him any heaven heaven nor did we intend to send down
it was but one shout and lo they were stilled
how the men of the servants
there came unto them a messenger but they mock him
have they not considered how many generations we destroyed before them that they will not return to them
all of them will be gathered before us
and sign for them is the dead land we we revive it and we and we forth from it grain they eat
and we place therein gardens of of datepalms and vines and we cause forth therefrom it
so that they may eat of its fruit and it their hands have cultivated
will they not be appreciative
exaltations to him who created all pairs of all the earth grows and of themselves and of of and they know not
and a sign for we have the night we strip the day of the and they are in it
the sun is running runs to a restingplace that is the ordaining of the allmighty the allknowing
and the moon we have disposed for phases till it returns like an old branch of the date stalk
it is not for the sun to overtake the moon nor does the night outstrip the day of each each an orbit
and a sign for them is that we carried their offspring in the laden ship
and we have created for them the like of it whereon they ride
and if we will we drown them and there will be no shout for help nor nor will they be rescued
except by a mercy from us and enjoyment for a while
and when it is said to them beware beware of what is before you and what is behind you that you may receive mercy
and there sign of the signs of their lord comes to them but they turn away from from it
and when it is said to them spend of that allah has provided you the unbelievers say the unbelievers who who who feed those who feed whom if feed feed whom he would feed feed
you are only in in open error
and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if you are truthful
they await only one shout which will seize them while they are involved
then they will not be able to make a testament nor will they return to their folks
and the trumpet is blown and behold they from the graves they to their lord
they will say “ woe to us
who has roused us from our sleepingplace
this is the the the the the of the former day
then the the of the the ”
it will be but one shout and behold they will all together before before us
so today no soul shall be wronged in the least nor will you be requited except for what you used to do
indeed today the dwellers of paradise will be engaged in pastimes
they and their spouses in shade reclining on adorned couches
they have therein fruits and all kinds and they they ask for
peace them will be peace be the word from merciful lord
and step aside you today you today day
children of adam did i not not you you that he you not worship the devil undoubtedly he is your open enemy
and that you should serve me this is the straight path
yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude
did you not understand
this is the hellfire of you were promised
roast therein it for today for you used to disbelieve
this day we will set a seal on their mouths and their hands speak speak to us and their feet will bear witness to what they have been working
and had we listed we could have quenched their eyes so they would understand understand
and had we willed we would have transformed them into their monkeys pigs and they they would not go forward nor backward
and he who we grant long life we reverse him in creation
do they not understand
and did not teach him poetry nor is it worthy him
this is only a reminder and a clear quran
that he may warn him who is alive and prove the word against the disbelievers
have they not seen how we have created for them of what they have created
we have subjected the them to them so that some of them they have
there they have other uses in them and drinks
what will they not give thanks
and they have taken taken for other gods other than allah that they may be helped
they can not help them help them and they army mobilized for them
so let not their speech grieve thee lo
we we know what they conceal and what they reveal
does not man see that we have created him from a drop of semen yet lo he is an open quarreller
and he has for us a forgets his own creation he says who who will revive the bones when they have decayed
say he who created you in the first time
he has the allknower of every creation
who has made for you from the green tree fire and you kindle kindle it
is not he who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them
yes
he is the supreme the creator
his command when he wills a thing is to say to it and it is
so glory be to him in whose hand is the dominion of all things
unto him you will be brought back
by the aligners aligning
and those drivers driving
and those who recite the exhortation
surely your god is one
the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and the lord of the easts
we have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the planets
and to preserve against from every satan
they can not eavesdrop on the supernal elite for they are bombarded from every side
they and and theirs is a constant torment
except such as snatches a fragment and he is pursued by a piercing flame
so ask them o are they stronger than or those who created created
we have them from sticky clay
but you wonder while they mock
and when they are reminded they pay no attention
and when they see a sign they turn to scoffing
and say this is nothing but plain magic
when we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we be be raised up
and our forefathers too
say you and you will utterly humble
it will be a single shout and behold they will be observing
they will say “ woe to us
this is the day of recompense
this is the day of separation which ye used to nt to belie
the angels will say “ the angels assemble those who did wrong and their what they used to worship
instead of allah and lead them to the path of flaming fire hell
and halt them to they they must be be questioned
what is the matter with you do not help each other
in fact this day they will be submissive
and some of them inclined to others mutually
they will say “ ye ye come to the right hand
they will say “ you yourselves were not believers
we had no you over you but you were an insolent people
so the word of our lord is realised against us that we have been
we we misled you we were ourselves
so this day they will share in punishment
that is how we deal with the guilty
for it was said to them there is no god except allah allah they were scornful
and said “ are we forsake our gods for the sake of a mad poet
in fact he has brought the truth and he confirmed the previous
verily you indeed taste the painful punishment
and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do
except the chosen bondmen of allah
for them there is a known provision
fruits and they will be honored
in the gardens of delight paradise
on furnishings facing one another
a goblet from a spring spring shall be passed round for them
white delicious delight to the drinkers
neither neither sickness sickness in it nor nor they
and with them will be maidens of refraining looks large eyed
as if they were hidden eggs
then one of them will turn to others questioning
one of them will say i had a comrade
who would say are you of those who believe
that when we are dead and become dust and bones shall we be be recompensed
he will say you look down
then he looked down and saw him amidst the blazing fire
he will say by allah by allah you almost ruined me
but for for the grace of my lord i would have been among those who have been mustered
are we not then to die
except for our first death and we shall not be punished
this this is the supreme triumph
for the like of this let the workers work
is this better better better entertainment or the tree of zaqqum
we have made this tree punishment for evildoers
it is a tree that grows from the bottom of hell
its shoots like as were <unk> of the devils
and they they eat eat and fill their bellies therewith
then afterward verily they have thereon drink of boiling water
then their retreat will be toward hell
they found their fathers in error
so they run in their footsteps
and indeed the had the the the the former peoples astray
and we had sent sent warners
so observe the end of those who had been been warned
except the chosen creatures of allah
noah had had prayed to us and how are we respond to him
and delivered him and his family from the great distress
and made made his descendants the survivors
and left for him among the posterity
peace be upon noah among all beings
as such we recompense the gooddoers
he was among our believing servants
then we drowned the others
and his party was abraham
when he came to his lord with a pure heart
when he said to his father and his people what what is you worship
is it a falsehood aliha gods other than allah that you desire
then what do you the the lord of the worlds
then he cast a glance at the stars
and said said i i feel sick
but they turned their backs him him
then he turned to their gods and said do you not eat
why do you not speak ’
then he slipped on them striking them with his right hand
so they came running towards him
he said worship do you worship what you yourselves carve
while allah has created you and what you make
they said “ construct a building furnace for him and cast him into the furnace
so they plotted a plot against him but we made them the
and he said i i going to to my lord he will guide me
my lord grant me a son
so we gave him the good news of a forbearing son
and when he was old enough to walk with him he said “ my my son i dreamt that i am sacrificing you
so what you have commanded commanded
allah willing you are commanded insha allah if allah will find me patiently assabirin the patient ones etc
when they submitted to his son and his son his son
we cried out out o abraham
you have indeed fulfilled the vision
verily we do we reward the muhsinun gooddoers
that was indeed a clear test
and we redeemed him with a great sacrifice
and we left for him among the posterity
peace be upon abraham
as such we recompense the gooddoers
he was among our believing servants
and we gave him the good news of isaac a prophet from among the righteous
and we blessed him and isaac
among of their are are some who do good and some plainly themselves
and we did certainly confer favor and aaron
and delivered them and their people from the great distress
and we supported them so they were the victors
and we gave them the clear book
and guided them to the straight path
and preserved for them a good name among posterity
peace be upon moses and haroon
as such we recompense the gooddoers
they are among our believing servants
and ilyas was one of the noble messengers
when he said to his people will you not be mindful of allah
do you call on baal and forsake the best of creators
allah your lord and the of your forefathers
they they denounced him so they will be be be be brought forth
except the chosen creatures of allah
and we left for him among the posterity
peace be upon elias
as such we recompense the gooddoers
he was among our believing servants
and too was one of the sent
when we delivered him and his his family all
except for old old woman who was of those behind
then we destroyed the others
you pass by them in the morning
and at night will you not understand
and jonah too was one of the messengers
when he fled to the laden ship
and he lots close to the one another
he he was flung to he was was was was was he was bound to be
then the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy
and had he not been of those who praised
he would have tarried in its belly till the day they are be raised
then we threw him on a wide bare tract of land
and we made a gourd tree grow over him
and we sent him to a hundred thousand people or even more
and they believed so we gave them enjoyment for a while
now ask them o muhammad saw has daughters and daughters while they sons
or did we create the angels females while they were witnessing
is it is of their their fabrications that they say
god has begotten children
they are indeed liars
so has preferred preferred above than sons
what is you how judge you judge
will you not then take admonition
or have you a clear authority
then produce your book if you are sooth
and they invented a relationship between him and the jinn
but the angels know that they will be arraigned
hallowed is allah above what they describe
except the chosen servants of allah
so verily you pagans and that which you worship
can not lead astray from him
except someone who is bound to burn hell
there is not one of us but has a known place
we are the those who are arranged in ranks
and we are we who celebrate allah s glory ’
they used to say
“ had we had some advice from the earlier generations
we would have been been the chosen servants of allah true believers
but they disbelieved it
presently they come to know
and verily our word went forth from old the our bondmen
that they would would be helped
and that our hosts will be the victors
so turn away from them for a while
and they will not
and they will see the punishment
do they seek to hasten our punishment
when it descends into their courtyard evil will be the morning of those forewarned
so leave them alone for a while
and they will not
and they will see the punishment
glorified is your lord the lord of honour above him that they describe
and peace be upon the sent ones
and all praise to to allah the lord of the worlds
suad
by the renowned qur an
those who disbelieve are steeped in arrogance and defiance
how many generations have we destroyed low before them
they when they came to help them
and they marvel that there has come to them a warner among themselves and the faithless say this is a lying sorcerer
has he made the gods one single one
this is really a strange strange thing
and their leaders among them went forth saying go and and remain constant in your aliha gods
this is indeed a thing thing
we have not heard of this in the latest religion
this is nothing but a fabrication
has the message been sent down to him out of all of us
in fact they are in doubt my my my nay but fact have not yet tasted my punishment
or have they the treasuries of the mercy of your lord the allmighty the allmunificent
or is theirs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
then let them ascend up the means of access
a army of confederates is defeated there is defeated there
before them the people of noah ad ’ and the people of the tentpegs of the stakes
and the tribe of thamud of lot and the dwellers of the wood these were the confederates
there was not of them but the messengers so my was my apostles
they await only but a single blast will will be a second
they say “ lord hasten us us share before the before the day of reckoning
o prophet mohammed peace and – blessings be upon him patiently endured and some man who was penitent and inclined towards allah and he was one who repeatedly turning back to allah and
we we subjected the mountains to glorify with praises with him at sunrise
and the birds gathered together all obedient to him
we made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech
and has there come to you the news of the adversaries when they scaled the wall into the
when they entered upon david david he was startled by them they said “
we are only two contenders one of us has bullied the other
judge between us justly and do not exceed the bounds of right and show us to the right path
behold this my brother has ninetynine ewes and i have one ewe and female sheep
then he said give her into my ewe and wants to me a better enough to me
david said he he he has wronged you in demanding your ewe in addition to his ewes
and indeed many partners oppress one another except those who believe and do good deeds but few few
david realized that we had sought to him and he sought forgiveness of his lord and begged his forgiveness and and fell down in homage
so we forgave him
he for him is nearness to us and a good place of return
o dawud david
we we have made you a vicegerent on the earth
judge between you with justice and do not follow your own preference to take it away from the path of allah
surely those who go astray from the way of allah shall have a severe punishment for having forgotten the day of reckoning
and we have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in purpose
so woe to those who disbelieve in the monotheism
shall we treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like those who cause corruption on the earth
shall we make the godfearing the vicious
this is a blessed book which we have sent down to you in you may ponder its verses and men and a lesson for those people intellect intellect intellect
we bestowed solomon david he was an excellent worshiper he was penitent worshiper
when when there were presented to him at the evening
he said “ i have loved the love of love of the sun the remembrance of my lord until the sun disappeared behind the veil
he said “ then be to to me and then become going to to them
then we we take the way of
we assuredly we tried sulaiman and his upon his throne a mere body
thereafter he was penitent
he said my lord forgive me and bestow upon a kingdom kingdom such as will not befit anyone after me but allah is the bestower
so we subjected to him the wind it ran gently by his command withersoever he directed
and the devils subservient to him all builders
and others others bound in bond
this is our gift so or withhold without or without any reckoning
and indeed for him is with us and a final resort
and remember our servant job in the quran
shaitan satan has touched me with losing my health and losing my health and losing my wealth
and was said to him strike the the with your foot and drink
a spring is cool bath and a refreshing drink
and we bestowed on him his household and with him and with them a a mercy from us and a reminder for men of understanding
and take in thine hand a handful of twigs grass and strike therewith and break not thine oath
then then i to take a soul
indeed we found him steadfast
we found him steadfast how excellent a slave
he he was ever turning in repentance
and remember our servants abraham isaac and jacob men of their qub jacob
we we purified them with exclusive remembrance of the remembrance of the abode
and in our sight they are among the chosen the excellent
and remember isma il ishmael alyasa elisha and dhulkifl isaiah all are among the ones
this is a remembrance
the excellent retreat awaits the godfearing
the gardens of eden whose doors will be open for them
reclining on couches they they they call for abundant and drinks
and with them will be virgins of modest gaze of age
this is what you are promised for the day of reckoning
this is is our provision neverending
this this for the virtuous and for the rebellious an ill resort
hell where they will will burn
how vile a resting place
this is so let them taste it boiling fluid and dirty wound discharges
and similar torments of diverse kinds
here is the army rushing blindly with you with you
they will say ‘ there wretchedness be wretchedness
for they will roast at the fire
they will say say “ no is you for you
it was leaders who brought this upon us an evil place
they will say “ lord whoever brought this upon us him double punishment in the fire of the fire
and they will say what aileth us that we behold not men whom we wo nt to count among the wicked
have we taken them in mockery
or have our eyes swerved from them
this that is true truth the the of of the the of the
say i am only a warner
there is no deity but allah the one the supreme
the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the almighty the forgiving
say it is is a great news
from which you turn away
i had no knowledge of the supernal elite when they contend
it is only to me that i am a plain warner
when your lord said to the angels “ i am about to create a human being from clay
so when i have proportioned him and breathed into him of my spirit fall fall fall fall fall fall fall fall fall down prostrate before him
so angels fell down prostrate one
except iblis he was proud and was one of the beginning
he said “ o iblis what prevented you from prostrating yourself before i created i have created with both my hands
are you too proud or fancy yourself to be among the exalted
he said i am better than him
you you me from fire and created him from clay
he said “ then get out of here
to disrespect an prophets
my curse shall rest my curse till the day of requital
he said my lord respite me until the day they shall be raised up
allah said “ you are of those allowed respite
until the day of the known time
he said by by your lord i i will seduce them
except those your chosen bondmen among them ”
allah said this is is the truth i speak the right way
i shall i will with you with you and with you you follows the follow you
say i ask not ask you any wage of this nor am i am no impostor
it is nothing but an admonition unto all beings
and you will surely know the truth of a while
the revelation of the book is from allah the mighty the wise
we have have sent down the book to you o muhammad peace be him making religion religion sincerely his to him
lo religion religion is religion religion is obedience to allah
and those who take taken besides than him guardians say we worship them only that they may bring us nearer to allah
allah will judge between them regarding their differences
god does not guide the lying blasphemer
if allah wanted to take a son or offspring or children he could have chosen whom he willed
glory be to him that he should a son
he is allah the one the overpowering
he created the heavens and the earth with consummate wisdom
he has the night over the day and rolleth the day and he disposed the sun and moon each moving for a specified term
he is is the allmighty the forgiver
he created you from one soul
then he made him that which he hath
he creates you in the bellies of the mothers creation creation creation creation
he creates you in the mothers and womb creation after creation creation in darkness darkness
to him belongs all that you in the heavens and the earth the leave of him
his is the kingdom there is no god but he
how then are you deviate
if you disbelieve then verily allah is not need of you
and he does not approve of disbelief to he he he of his disbelief
no one grateful he will be be
no bearer of burden can bear the burden of another
then to your lord is your return and he will inform you what what you used to do
allah is aware of what is in the breasts
when distress befalls man he supplicates his lord turning to him penitently to him
then when he made a boon from him him forgets him and forgetteth that which he had him him and setteth up rivals with allah
say o muhammad unto such a in thy pleasure a for a while
lo thou art of the owners of the fire
is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night prostrating and standing bewaring of the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord like one who turns to
say are those who know and those who do not know
only those who possess intellect take heed
say ‘ my declares o my servants who have faith your lord
for those who do good in this world there is good and allah earth is spacious
and the earth of allah spacious spacious
indeed those who persevere will be paid their full without stint without reckoning
say i am commanded to worship worship allah allah making my religion sincerely his
and i am commanded to be the first of those who submit to him
say indeed i fear if i disobeyed my lord the punishment of a tremendous day
say i worship allah allah i worship allah my religion
so worship what you will apart from him
say the the losers are those who lose themselves and their families on the day of resurrection that will be the open disgraceful punishment
there will be canopies of fire above them and similar canopies beneath them
this is allah end against his servants
so dread my wrath
and those who stayed the worship of idols and worship worship of allah and inclined towards allah and announce glad tidings to the glad tidings
who listen to the word of falsehood and follow the best interpretation of it
these are they whom allah has guided
these are they who possess intellect
o muhammad who can save thou wilt wilt not be the sentence of those who who gone aforetime
but those who feared their lord for them are chambers above chambers built beneath chambers built built rivers flow
this is the promise of allah
allah does not break his promise
have you not see that allah sends down water from the sky and threaded it flow springs the earth then produceth produceth it produceth produceth of corn various coloured
then he brings forth the dead and turn it you turn yellow then he chaff
there is indeed a lesson in this for those who possess intellect
is someone whose breast allah has opened to islam so that he follows the light from his lord
woe woe to those whose hearts have hardened against the remembrance of allah
they are in manifest error
allah has sent down the fairest discourse book the book consimilar in its oftrepeated whereat shiver those who are their lord s orders their skins and their skins and their skins and their skins and the hearts soften at the remembrance of their lord
then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of allah
that is the guidance of allah
and to whom he will to a straight path
and one whom allah leaves astray for him there is no guide
is he who will be the his of his his on the day of resurrection the evil will be be the the on the day of resurrection whose the will be be be the successful
those who were before denied denied the lie
and as for the punishment from the punishment of punishment
so allah made them taste disgrace in worldly life
but the punishment of the hereafter is greater if they but they but they know
we have indeed propounded for mankind in this qur an every kinds of similitudes that haply they may ponder
an arabic qur without any crookedness so that they may be godwary
allah propoundeth a similitude man man having partners in a man man man man man and man and man
are the two equal in similitude
all praise belongs to allah
but most of them do not know
you die die and they are destined to die
then on the day of resurrection you will contend before your lord
who is more wrong than he who lies lie against allah and denies the truth when it comes to him
is there not in hell room in the ungrateful
and who who the truth and believeth and it — it is they who are the godwary
they will have what they wish with their lord
such is the reward of the good
so that allah may remit from them worst of what they did and reward them according to the best of what they used to do
is not allah sufficient for his slave
yet they would frighten you with others apart him
and whom allah leads astray no guide has show him
and he whom allah guides for him there is no misleader
is not allah the lord of might and owner of retribution
if if you asked them who who created the heavens and the earth they will say “
say them have you you you of allah if you invoke other allah allah allah allah allah allah if allah should remove the servants of his servants
or if he should a mercy upon me they will they withhold his mercy
say allah is sufficient for me
in him the reliant rely ”
proclaim “ o my people
i will soon your ability in your positions i am acting and you will soon come to know
to whom will come a punishment punishment and will degrade him and whom will descend
we we sent down to you the book with the truth
so whosoever accepts the guidance guidance guidance is only for his ownself and whosoever goes astray only goes astray only goes astray only goes astray only goes astray only goes astray only goes astray only goes astray only goes astray only goes astray
and he who strays in error does so to its detriment
and you are not a manager over them
allah takes the souls at the time of their death and those who have not died during their sleep
he keeps those who are wo nt to grant the life for death and releases the the a specified term
and have are signs signs for a people who reflect
have they appointed intercessors other intercessors
say “ though they have no power over anything and nothing
say to allah belongs the altogether
his is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth then he will be brought back to him
and when allah alone is the hearts of those who do not believe in the hearts of those who believe in the hereafter when they are are besides him
say o allah allah originator of the heavens and the earth knower knowest the knower of the unknown and the you you judge between your servants
and if those who had wrong in it all that is in the earth and the earth as much again therewith it again on the day of resurrection and they redeem themselves from it from the day of resurrection and they will appear to them from allah and they
and the evils of that they had earned will appear to them and they will be encompassed by what they used to deride
when adversity touches the human being he calls on us
then when we grant him a a blessing from us he says “ i have attained a virtue of virtue knowledge ”
nay it is is a test but most of them do not know
verily this is the the of of the who had before before
but of what they had not nothing availed them
and the evil of caught their deeds
the the the evil deeds of those who have been sinners and so will be be of what they did
they will not get unable to frustrate us
do they not know that allah extends the provision to whomever he wills and straitens it for whom he wills
there are indeed signs in that for a people who have faith
say o my declares o my servants who have committed excesses against themselves own souls do not despair disheartened of mercy mercy of allah
surely allah forgives all sins
he is the forgiving the merciful
turn to your lord and surrender to him before the punishment overtakes you for then you will not be helped
follow the best of what has been revealed to you from your lord before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you are unaware
so that no soul say “ this negligence in the
the i should be of those who ridiculed ’
or lest it should say if only allah had guided me i would have been among the godfearing
or should say when it seeth the punishment oh if i were a second chance second i will be among the good
certainly my lord came to you but you denied them and – blessings be upon him – and you were proud and were proud and were the disbelievers
and on the day of resurrection you will see those who lied against allah with their faces blackened
is there not a place of hell for the arrogant
and allah will deliver those who feared him muttaqun pious see v 2 2 to their places of success paradise
no harm shall touch nor nor will they grieve
allah is the creator of all things and he is over guarantor of all things
to him belongs the keys of the heavens and the earth
and those who blaspheme the signs of allah — it is they who are the losers
say o muhammad saw to those ignorant you bid me to worship other than allah
and it it been revealed to you o muhammad saw those who have been before you and to those who associate others with allah in his divinity will be be be be losers
rather worship allah alone and be among the grateful
they have not recognise the true worth
the earth altogether be on the day of resurrection heavens the heavens and on the earth will be rolled up in his right hand
exalted is he and high above what they associate
and the trumpet shall be blown and everyone who are in the heavens and the earth will be stunned except whomever god wills
then it shall be blown a second time behold they will rise up looking on
and the earth will shine with the light of its lord and the book will be set and the prophets and the prophets will be brought to judgment and the witnesses will be brought to and they will not be wronged
and everyone shall be paid in full for what it had done
he is aware aware of what they do
in companies the unbelievers will be driven into hell
until when they are reached its gates are opened its its keepers will say to them did not did not messengers to you reciting to you from among yourselves reciting to you the verses of your lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours
they will say “ yes indeed the sentence of punishment was justified against the unbelievers
it will be said “ enter the gates of hell herein therein abide abide
how wretched is the destination of the arrogant
then those that feared their lord will be driven in companies into paradise
and when they opened its gates will opened its its its its keepers will its keepers will say to them “ peace be upon you
so have done well
enter it live in it it
and they will say “ praise be to allah who has fulfilled his promise to us and made us inherit the land to inherit the land
how excellent is the wage of those workers
and you will see the angels surrounding the throne exalting allah with praise of their lord
and they will be judged between them equitably and it will be “ allah has the worlds the worlds
ha mim
the revelation of the book is from allah the allmighty the allknowing
forgiver forgiver of sin acceptor of repentance severe in retribution owner of abundance
there is no god but him — is the destination
none but the unbelievers dispute regarding the verses of allah
so let not their strutting about in in the land delude you
the people of noah denied before them and the factions factions every nation of their did before him and every messenger messenger to seize him and disputed with falsehood and refute the lie to refute the truth
so i seized them and how terrible was my punishment
thus the sentence of your lord concerning the infidels will be realized against the inmates of the fire
those who bear the throne and those who are around it celebrate the praises of their lord and believe in him and ask forgiveness for those who believe saying our lord
you embrace everything things in mercy and knowledge
so forgive those who repent and follow your path and guard them against the chastisement of hell
our lord them admit them to gardens of eden which you hast promised and and their spouses and their spouses and their progeny
you are the almighty the most wise
and guard them against all ills
and whosoever you guarded against from evil the day of that day and that day and that day is that day
it is the ones who disbelieve will be addressed to the hatred of allah is more than than your hatred of the and you you you you you were to be told
you were called to belief but disbelieved
they will say o our lord you made us die and twice and we have we have given us sins and you us two life and we have now
that is because when allah was enjoined upon you because of disbelieved but when others associated associated with him you believed believed
so belongs to allah the allhigh the supreme
it is he who shows you his signs and sends down to you from heaven and and can not accept it except in the and and he is the best of
so call upon allah making your religion pure sincerely for the unbelievers
he in ranks of degrees of the throne he casteth the spirit of inspiration of his of whom he wills of his servants on warn the day of meeting
the day when they will appear naught of of of will be concealed from allah
allah will will reply god is the the omnipotent
this day every soul will be recompensed for what it had earned
there will be no injustice today
surely allah is swift at reckoning
and warn them of the day of the drawing near the throats filling the throats choking with a throats and you will neither be nor nor any intercessor whose hearts is a
the will will have no intimate friend nor intercessor intercessor intercessor
he knows the fraud of the eyes and what the breasts conceal
allah decreeth with justice while those whom they call upon him him can not judge anything at all
indeed is allhearing allseeing seeing
have they not travelled through the land and seen how was the end of those before them
they were greater than they and in respect left in the traces on the earth
but allah seized them with punishment for their sins
and none had they had protect them from allah
that was because their messengers brought them clear proofs to them with clear proofs but allah disbelieved so allah seized them with them
he is strong severe in retribution
we sent moses with our signs and a clear authority
to pharaoh haman and korah but they said a lying sorcerer a liar
and when he brought them the truth from us they said kill the sons of those who believe with him and spare their women
but the plot of the faithless is bound to fail
and fir awn “ let me to kill moses and let him call to his lord
i fear that he will change your religion or cause he may cause mischief to appear in the land
moses said i take refuge in my lord and your lord from every who waxes in does not believe in in the day of reckoning
and a man man was one of his people who would say “ kill a man says my my lord is allah your lord
he has brought you clear signs from your lord
if he is a liar his lying is him but if he is truthful then if he is telling of what he will threateneth you will strike you
god does not guide the sinner sinner
o my people people the village of land land land i said “ i i am going to stay with you aginst the earth and allah will make him to us and i will make him to the same for and i will make him to the path of
he who had believed said “ o my people i fear for you the like of the confederates of the day
the the of the people of the people of noah and aad and thamud
allah does not wrong injustice for his servants his servants and he will please and allah is wrong servants servants
and o my people i fear for you the day of calling
the day when you will turn your backs and flee from defender against god
he whom allah lets go astray none none to show him to show him the right way
joseph had come to you with clear signs before you continued to doubt doubt doubt what he brought to you he said never send a messenger after him
thereafter when allah perished you said allah shall not send a messenger after him after him
thus allah leads astray the outrageous skeptic
those who wrangle regarding the signs of allah without any authority that have come to them
that is the abhorrent to allah and accept faith
thus is how seals the heart of proud and perverse
and said said o haman build for me a tower that i may reach the
the the of the day whereon i i i i think that i may not not to be of the liars
“ has has been upon the guidance of the who
the the of the the is is the
and the king came to them so the the the people
the one who had believed said “ o my people follow me and i will guide you to the right path
o people the life of this world is ephemeral but enduring hereafter is the the permanent the the hereafter
and whoever commits a sin shall be repaid only with its like
but whoever works righteousness whether male or female and is a believer these — enter paradise where they will be provided there without any without any without any without any
o people what is it with me that i call you to salvation and you call me to the fire
you call me to disbelieve in allah and ascribe to partners to him and i have no knowledge of that you have i know that to the the the most forgiving
there doubt you to whom you call call me to call my my my request or my
to to allah will be the excessive and the the the the the the the fire
and you will remember what i say to you
i confide my cause to allah
indeed is observant of the servants ”
so allah warded him from the evils of their plotted and a dreadful punishment besieged pharaoh s clan ’
the fire they are exposed to it and evening and the the day when the hour is opened and the pharaoh will be said to the people of pharaoh most family of pharaoh and the severest punishment
and when they will remonstrate with one another the weak weak weak weak weak weak weak weak say to those who were arrogant
you will you then lighten for us a part of the suffering of the fire
those who had waxed proud will reply all all together herein
allah has has judged between his servants
and those in the fire will say to the keepers of hell supplicate your lord to lighten for us the punishment of a day for us
they will say “ did not come to you with you with clear proofs
they will say yea they did
they will say “ then pray yourselves but the the disbelievers of the everlasting life today
indeed we will help our messengers and those who believe in the life of the world and on the day when the witnesses arise
the day day no excuse will benefit the harmdoers
they shall be victims of the curse and a woeful abode
we we gave moses the guidance and bequeathed the book the children of israel
a guidance and a reminder for those of understanding
so be patient
the promise of allah is true
and ask forgiveness for your sin and celebrate the praise of your lord and the evening and the morning
those who dispute regarding the verses of allah without any authority having come to them in in nothing in in their hearts there is nothing in in the hearts except pride
so take refuge in god surely he is allhearing and allseeing
the the of of the heavens and the earth is indeed a creation of mankind but most of mankind know not
and the blind and the seeing are not alike nor those who believe and do good works and the evildoer
little is you reflect
indeed the hour is coming there is no doubt about it but most people do not believe
your lord has said call call to me and i will answer your
surely those who disdain my worship worship worship hell hell
it is god who made the night for you that you may rest therein and the day allowing sight
allah is is full of bounty to mankind yet most of mankind people not give thanks
he is allah your lord creator creator of all things
there is no god except he
wither then are you perverted
thus is how those who deny the signs of allah
it is he who has the earth you a dwelling place for you and the sky a canopy and gave you provision and has made you shapes good
he is designed you designed you and designed you with your lord
blessed blessed be allah the lord of the worlds
he is the living one
there is no god but he
all praise is due to allah the lord of the worlds
say o muhammad saw i am been forbidden to worship those whom you worship besides allah as clear authority have come to me from my lord and i am commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds
it is he created created from from from dust then from a spermdrop drop of sperm then then fashioned you you a a then then fashioned you you
and he is you after you come you you come after you come to you
but among you die you die and you you reach and several term may you may understand
he it is who gives life and death
and whensoever he decreeth a affair he only saith to it be and it becometh
observest thou not seen those who wrangle concerning the revelations of allah how are are turned away
those who deny the book and that which we have sent our messengers with soon they will soon know
when iron collars will be rounded over their necks and chains chains they chains
in boiling water then into the fire they will be filled
then it will be said to them where are those partners you used to worship
other than allah they will reply they have gone astray from us
in fact it we invoke to invoke to call upon the disbelievers
that is because you were been exulting in the earth without right and because you used to behave with vanity
enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein
hapless is the abode of the stiffnecked
so be patient o prophet
surely allah s promise is true
whether prophet muhammad we of them we let them to you you stones at you when they were in you
we sent sent many before you some of them we have related to you and we have not have we have not have whose messengers before you
no messenger not bring a miracle except by god s leave
so when the command of allah comes judgment will be passed then and passed and the seekers of vanity will lose
it is allah who made for you for you so that you ride and some of them you eat
from in your benefits and them them them them
and there are on ships ships they them and there them them and and them them carried them
he shows his signs
so which of the signs of allah do you deny
have they not travelled through the land and seen how was the end of those before them
they were more numerous than these and mightier in strength and in traces in the land
but their what they had not avail them
when their messengers came to them with clear proofs they boasted in exulted in their knowledge they were enveloped
and that which were wo nt to mock befell them
then when they saw our punishment they said “ we believe in allah alone and we reject what we used to associate with him
but their their faith they did not benefit them punishment until they had come to them
this is the way of allah which dealing with dealing in his servants
there the disbelievers will be ruined
ha mim
a sending down from the the merciful the most merciful
a book whose verses have been distinguished an explained in lucid discourse for those who have
giving a good and heralding warning and warning and warning and those who do not listen to the truth and do not listen to the truth
and they say “ our hearts are screened from you to us and you our ears there is a deafness and between us and you is a barrier between us
there is a deafness in our ears and a veil veil lies between us and you
so work as you are we are working
say ‘ them o muhammad saw i only follow only to you
it has inspireth inspired to me that your god is the one god
and woe to almushrikun the disbelievers in the oneness of allah polytheists idolaters etc
who do not pay the alms and regarding the hereafter they are disbelievers
as for those who believe and do good works for them is a reward uninterrupted
say o muhammad saw disbelieve those who created the earth and two two days and ascribe partners to him in him
he is the lord of the worlds
he placed therein rising above its rising above it blessed it blessed and blessed it and for the seekers
then he turned to the heavens and it was smoke
he said to them “ come down and the obedience and continue to me stay stay ”
then he completed them seven creation in the heavens and the two days and he revealed in heaven heavens and the earth
and we adorned the lower heaven with lamps and guarded them protection
that is the ordaining of the allmighty the allknowing
but if they turn away say i i warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of the aad and thamud
when their messengers came to them from them and behind them saying worship none but allah allah they said our lord they had willed he would have sent down angels
we reject what is sent with you you have been sent with
as for ad they waxed proud in the earth without right and they said “ who is stronger than us
did they not see that allah who created them was stronger than they might might might might might might
and they refused to believe our signs
we unleashed upon them a icy gale during illfated days that we might make them taste a humiliating punishment in the life of the world
yet the punishment of the hereafter will be more disgraceful and they will not be helped
as for the tribe of the we we guided them the guidance so the thunderbolt seized them the punishment of humiliation because they were to earn
and we saved those who believed and feared allah
and mention the day when the enemies of allah are herded into the fire forcibly the the people of the
when they reach it their their hearing their eyes and their skins will testify against them concerning what they were doing
and they say to their skins why why you you testified to us
they will say ‘ allah has given speech speech all things speech speech speech
he created you who created you the first time and it is to him you will be returned
you did not hide your doings so that your eyes and your skins should bear witness against you but you thought that allah has not much of what you did not know
that is the notion you had thought about your lord has caused you to your you and you have become the losers
in their state whether they bear with patience or the fire of their abode
and if they seek to make amends they will not be allowed to appease allah
we had assigned them comrades them who glamorized to what what was before them and what was behind them
and the word concerning nations of the jinn and humankind the jinn and humans alike the previous generations of jinn
they were indeed bound to perish
the unbelievers say “ do not listen to this qur an and you may prevail prevail overcome you
we will certainly make the unbelievers taste a severe punishment and we will surely requite them of what they used to do
this is the recompense of allah s enemies enemies the fire will be the home of eternity as they will have their signs
and those who disbelieve will say our lord show us those who led us astray and jinn and men and we and we will trample them underneath underneath our feet so they may be among the lowest
indeed those who say our lord is allah and and then istaqamu angels descend descend at the angels descend at the angels saying do not grieve grieve
receive the good news of the paradise which you have been promised
we are your friends in the life of this world and in the hereafter you will have whatever your souls desire and therein will have for you for you
as a from the one one forgiving merciful
and who is better in speech than he who prayeth to his and and doeth right and says allah i am am muslim
and good deed of the evil deed are not alike repel with evil which is fairer one and he and he is enmity between friend and though he was enmity will be a bosom friend
but none is granted it except those who are patient and none except the owner of a great portion
if any listener should you distracting seek refuge for you seek refuge in god he is the allhearing the allknowing
and of his signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon
do not prostrate to the sun nor before the moon but prostrate yourselves before allah who created them if it is him that worship
but if they are proud then those who who are are with your lord glorify him by night and day and and not weary
and of his signs is that you see the land still
but when we send down water upon it it stirs and grows
surely he who gives it life to the dead to the dead
indeed he has power over all things
those who blaspheme our signs are not hidden from us
is someone who is cast into the fire better or he who comes secure secure on the day of resurrection
he is indeed seeing your deeds
those who reject the reminder when it comes to them and when it is an invincible book
falsehood can not come it it from before it or from behind
it is a revelation from the wise the praised
naught is said to thee muhammad saw what already been said to the messengers before you
indeed your lord is owner of forgiveness and owner of punishment
had we made it a nonarabic qur an foreign language they would have said “ why have only its a sound
a book in arabic book and an arab
a it is a guidance and a healing for the believers
and as for those who do not believe it serves a a covering
they are being faithless from a distant place
we gave gave moses the book but the arose it it
and if not for a word that preceded from your lord and would have been concluded between them
and they are in in doubt concerning it
whoever does righteously it so for his own and whoever does evil does evil it
your lord never wrongs his worshipers
and alone is knowledge knowledge of the hour and no female conceives or brings no with no female conceives or delivers except with his knowledge
and on the day when he calleth unto them where are my partners unto allah will say we we confess thee not no strength for us
and those they used to invoke upon forsake and they will vanish from them and they they have no asylum
man is tires of praying for good but if evil assails him he begins to despair
if we distress has befallen him taste taste mercy from us after some distress befallen him he is my my
i do not think the hour will come
but for for i i have my lord my lord will be him with the best
then we will tell the unbelievers have done to us and we will them them
when we we favor he he turns away and distances himself but he prays when he prays him he is full of extensive prayer
say tell them if it is from allah and you disbelieve in it is the who is in extreme dissension
we will show them our signs in the horizons and in their ownselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth and to them
is it not sufficient that your lord is witness over everything things
indeed they are in doubt about the meeting with their lord
surely he encompasses everything
ha mim
sin seen qaf qaf
so reveals to thee prophet muhammad saw reveals to to those before you
to him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
he is the the the magnificent
wellnigh the heavens might be rent in sunder from above them
and the angels hallow the praise of their lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth
god is is the forgiver the merciful
as for those who take awliya besides him those who them are not responsible guardian over them
and we we have revealed to you arabic koran that you may warn the mother of the mother of villages warn the of of the around it and warn the of of the day of gathering of it is no doubt it in a group of the blazing in
had god had willed he would have made them one community but he admits whomever he wills into his mercy
and the wrongdoers have no no helper
or have they taken to themselves guardians other than him
but he is allah the lord of the
he has power over all things
and in whatsoever you differ the verdict thereof is judgment allah
such is is my lord in him i have relied and to him i turn
the originator of the heavens and the earth he has made for you mates of yourselves and and pairs cattle and he multiplies you
there is no other like him
he is allhearing allseeing
to him belongs the keys of the heavens and the earth
he enlarges and straitens the sustenance of whomsoever he pleases
he is aware of all things
he has laid for you the religion that he has enjoined upon noah and that which we have revealed to you and that which we have enjoined upon noah and jesus and establish establish abraham and establish religion and establish the religion
very hateful the idolaters that to them to that outrageous to them
allah chooses for himself whom he will and guides to himself whoever turns back him
they they did not until after knowledge had come to them through transgression among themselves
and had it not a predetermined word that preceded from your lord postponing the term is concluded would have been concluded between them
and those who were made inherit the book after them are in grave doubt about it
yet what you summon you with and be constant in
and let them not follow their desires accord i believe in allah allah sent down to you in am am commanded to be you and i am not in you you you you you
allah is our lord and your lord
we us us your deeds and you your deeds
there is no need between us and you
allah will bring us together and to him is the destination
as for those who argue concerning the after of allah has been acknowledged their contention is void their lord
upon is is a severe punishment and the punishment will be a severe punishment
allah is allah who has sent down the book with the truth and the balance
and what will make you know the hour is near
those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it but those who believe in fearful of it and know that it is the truth
indeed those who are in doubt concerning the hour are in extreme error
allah is gracious to his servants and provideth provisions for whom he wills
he is the powerful the allmighty
whoso desireth the tillage of the hereafter we shall give him his tillage and whoso seeketh the tillage of the world we shall give him thereof thereof and he shall have no share in the hereafter
or have they partners who have prescribed for for them a religion which which allah has not consented
but for the word decree decision would have been concluded between them
for the evildoers there is a painful punishment
you will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned and it will befall them
and those who believe and do oneness of allah islamic monotheism and do righteous good deeds will be in lush regions of paradise and will be in paradise
that is what they wish from the lord of this is a great bounty
that is the good news that allah gives to his servants who have faith and do good deeds
say i do not ask you a a except for it except for gains of good and good gains and we shall increase the reward of good
lo
allah is forgiving and
or they say “ he fabricated a lie about allah ”
if if willed he could have sealed your heart
and allah eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by his words
he knows knows the secrets of the chests
it is he who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons sins and knows what you do
and he answers those who believe and do good deeds of them he gives them his his bounty
as for the unbelievers there is a severe punishment
and had allah increased his sustenance to his bondmen in their they would have he he sends the in the earth he he he he he he he he will he he will of his servants and he is most suitable
and he it is who sendeth down the rain after they have despaired and spreadeth abroad his mercy
he is the protector the praised
and of his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and he has he he has dispersed in them twain
and he is able to bring them together together
and whatever of misfortune befalls you your own what is your hands have earned
and he pardons much
you are not able to frustrate him in the earth nor have you have no protecting friend nor any helper
and of his signs are the ships that run on the sea like landmarks
if he he he causeth the wind so that they remain motionless on its surface indeed indeed firm is a every greatly person
or he could destroy them because of what they have earned and he pardons much
and those who who our our who have no no escape for them there is no escape for them
whatever thing you have been given is only usage of the life of this world and that is with allah and that lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their lord
and those who avoid the major sins and indecencies and when they are angry
and who answer the commands of their lord and establish prayer prayer and and counsel by mutual counsel between them and and who spend of what we have provided them
and those who when tyranny strikes them
the guerdon of an evil is like ill like
but whoever pardoneth and amendeth his wage is with allah
lo he loveth not love zalimun polytheists and wrongdoers etc
and whosoever harms after he has suffered no no wrong against them
the way of blame is only against those who oppress the land and commit tyranny in the land
for them there is a painful punishment
but he who patiently and and forgives that is of the resolve
he whom allah leads astray no protector apart from him
and you see the wrongdoers when they see the punishment saying is there is a a back back
and you see them exposed to the fire humbled with disgrace looking with looking with stealthy glance
and those who believe will say “ the forfeit their their families on the day of resurrection and who lose themselves
lo the wrongdoers will abide in lasting punishment
and they will not be for them any allies to them them
he whom allah leads astray no way for him
answer your lord before day comes a day day which can not be be for you can not be be to you nor will you be a day of which you will be be
but if they turn away we have not sent you to them a guardian over them
your task is only to convey the message
and when we let him taste mercy mercy from us rejoices rejoices in it but if his evil befalls them because of what what is because of what is because of what is
to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
he creates what he wills he grants females to whomever he pleases and males to whomever he wills
or he couples them males and females and he makes to makes barren whomever he wills
he is allknowing allpowerful
it is not for any human being that that or a except by revelation or a veil or a veil or a he is a by by he he he he he he wills and he is allhigh allwise
and thus we have revealed to you a spirit of our command
you did not know what the book is like unto we guide we guide the the light of our servants
and lo thou verily dost unto a a of a straight
the path of allah to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
lo unto allah all things return
ha mim
by the clear book
we we have made it an arabic qur an that you may understand
and verily it is in the essence of the book with us sublime and wise
shall we then ignore you because you are a wanton people
and how many a prophet did we send the ancients
and never came there came to them a prophet but they they used to mock him
we utterly destroyed far more than they in the life
the example of earlier earlier peoples separated
and if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they will surely say “ the mighty the knower
who has made the earth a bed for you and made roads for you in it that you may be guided
and who sendeth down water from the sky in due measure and we revive a dead land therewith
even so will you be brought forth
he who created all the pairs and appointed for you ships and cattle on which you ride
that you may mount their backs and you you remember the favor of your lord when you mount thereon and say to them who has subjected this and us and we not have been guided
and verily unto our lord we are are returning
yet they have made some of his servants his part
man is clearly most
or has he taken for himself from what he has chosen daughters and chosen you you sons
and when one of them is given the news of what he likened to the allmerciful and face face becomes dark and he suppresses grief
what one who brought up amid ornaments and is not wellversed in the <unk> of altercation comes to
they claim that angels who are the the chosen servants are females
did they witness their creation
their testimony will be recorded and they will be interrogated
and say ‘ if the most gracious had willed we would not have worshipped them
they have no knowledge of that
they do not guess
or have we given them a book before this before which they hold holding on it
nay they they say we found our fathers on a way and we are guided guided by their footsteps
and we we never not any warner before you o muhammad saw any city they their luxurious ones but we found our fathers following a city and we we found our fathers following a their religion and we are surely their footsteps
and the warner said even though you bring better better better guidance than you you found your fathers following
they said “ we disbelieve in what you are sent with ”
so we wreaked vengeance upon them
so look consider the end of those who denied
and when abraham said to his father and his people “ i repudiate what you worship
except him who originated me and he will guide me
and he made it a word enduring among his descendants that haply they may return
nay but i gave these and their forefathers of their fathers and and the truth and a messenger messenger
and when the truth came to them they said this is magic and we disbelieve in it is it
and they say why why is this qur an been sent down to some great man from the two cities
is it they who distribute the mercy of your lord
it is we who have distributed their livelihood in the life and this world and we raised some of them above others in some of them above others
the favours of your lord is better than whatever they amass
and it were not that mankind would have become one community we would have made for those who disbelieve in the roofs of roofs for the houses of silver and stairs of silver which which whereby their ascend
and silver doors for their houses and couches of silver upon which they would recline
and ornament of gold
and yet the would have been made with the pro vision of the life of the world and the hereafter with the hereafter with your lord is end
and whoever whose remembrance will dim to the remembrance of arrahman we assign him a devil to his companion
and they bar them from the way of they think they are guided
when when comes to comes to us he will say to me and would have been between me and between the distance of the west
what evil a companion you are ”
it today that day will not benefit you
you are partners in the suffering
can you you make the deaf to hear or canst thou guide the blind and him who is in manifest error
and if we take you away we shall take vengeance on them
or if we show thee that wherewith we threaten them for lo
we are certainly well within them
so hold fast to what which is inspired in you
you are are on straight path
it is indeed a reminder to you and your people and you will soon be questioned
ask those of our messengers whom we sent before you had we before you have besides than any other than arrahman
and we we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his council and he said i am am the messenger of the lord of the worlds
but when he brought them our signs they started laughing at at them
and not not sign we shewed them greater than its counterpart and we them with the the the the so that they may return to the right path
they said “ sorcerer sorcerer pray to your lord for us to what you have promised you we will surely you you
but when sooner did we take them from the affliction they they broke their pledge
and pharaoh pharaoh to his proclamation from his people saying o my people i not mine my dominion and that i not not me
am i not better than this contemptible man who can can not make himself meaning of speech
why have no bracelets of gold been sent upon him or angels sent down upon him
thus he he out his people and and obeyed him
they they were a iniquitous people
so when they incurred the wrath we exacted retribution from them and drowned them all
and we made them a bygone and and an lesson for the latter generations
and when the son of mary was quoted an example laugh at the people thereof
they said “ what is in allah that he he not be a bondman
they are they a people people
he was just a servant whom we favoured and made made an example of the children of israel
and if we willed we could have made instead of you you succeeding earth the successors on the earth
and is certainly the sign of the the of the coming of the hour
so follow the words follow follow me follow me follow follow me and follow the other of islamic monotheism
and let not satan turn you aside
he he is to open enemy
and jesus came with with clear proofs he said i i have come to you with wisdom and to explain to you some of things that differ differ
so fear allah and obey me
indeed allah is my lord and your lord so worship him
this is the straight path
but the factions differed among themselves
so woe to the wrongdoers for the torment of a painful day
are they waiting for anything but the hour that it should come upon them suddenly while they perceive not
close that day will be enemies to one another except for one righteous
to such will be said o my servants you servants you have have no fear nor nor grief today
you who believed in our revelations and were muslims
enter paradise you and your wives joyfully
circulated among them will be passed large platters of gold
therein is whatever is in the souls desire and delights the eyes
and you will stay in
this is the paradise which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do
therein you will have abundant fruit from plenty eat eat
but the guilty will abide in hell
it will not be abated from them and they will be therein
we did not not but they were the who were the wrong themselves
and malik will will call out of hell “ our lord let us to stay forever ” will will stay here ”
we we have brought the truth but most of you to the truth
have they determined an affair while they work indeed indeed we are determining
or do they think that we do not hear their secret and their private talks
yes indeed do and our messengers present with them writing down
say if muhammad if the merciful had a son then i would be the first to worship worshippers
glorified be to lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the throne from what they describe
so leave them alone to indulge and play until they encounter that day they are promised
and it is who who is the in the heaven and the the
he is the wise the knower
blessed be to him the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between between them and he is the kingdom of the hour
he alone has knowledge of the hour and to him you you will return
and they call upon him have no power of intercession except those who testify to the truth those who have knowledge
if you ask them asked them “ created them ” they will surely say “ ”
how then are they deviate
and for his his saying my lord these are a people who believe not believe
then turn them and them them
they will come to know
ha mim
by the clear book
we have sent it on a blessed blessed night we have been warning
therein is decreed all affairs matter
by a command from us lo we are ever sending
as a mercy from your lord
he is the hearer the knower
lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them if you are certain convinced
there is no god but he
he revives and causes to die
he is your lord and the lord of your first of your forefathers
nay they play in in doubt
so watch the day when the sky will bring a visible smoke
which would envelope mankind
this will be a painful punishment
our lord will say “ our lord remove us from us we will indeed we are believers
how should they be remembrance for them a messenger already come to them
yet they turned away from him and said “ is a madman
we will remove the punishment for a while but revert
the day when we shall seize them with a terrible seizing will will take
and we had tried the people of pharaoh people of a noble messenger came them
saying render to to me the servants of allah
i am am honest messenger to you
and do not defy allah
indeed i bring you a clear authority
i take take refuge of my lord and your lord lest you stone me
and if you do not believe me then leave me alone
then he called to his lord saying these are a guilty people
then his lord commanded take with my servants by night
lo ye will be pursued
and leave the sea in stillness
indeed pursuing hosts will surely be drowned
how many gardens and fountains did they leave behind
and sown fields and noble
and the things they they rejoiced
even so it was and we made it inheritance inheritance to inherit
and the heaven earth wept for them nor were they respited
and we delivered the children of israel from the disgraceful punishment
from fir
he was a transgressing tyrant
and we exalted elected them with knowledge above the worlds
and gave signs of them in which there was a clear test
these these people are saying
there is naught dying for us but we shall not be raised again
bring back our ancestors if you are truthful ”
are they better or the people of tubba and those before them
and those who were before them
they were evildoers
and we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
we created them not save with truth but most of them do not know
the the day of distinction is the appointed time for all
the day when neither will not be avail to them nor will they be helped
except those who are pious and verse 43 67
apart from allah on whom allah has mercy
he is the the allmighty the merciful
the tree of alzaqqum
is food food of the guilty
like molten lead boiling inside the bellies
as the boiling of scalding water
it will be drag him into the midst of hell
then pour over his head the torment of scalding water
saying taste
indeed you are the the the noble
this this is that whereof ye used wo nt to nt to
surely those who fear allah will be in a place
amidst gardens midst and springs
dressed in silk and brocade facing one another face
so shall it be and we shall espouse them to fair wideeyed maidens
they will call therein for every kind of fruit in peace
they will not taste death therein except the first death and he will shield them from the punishment of hell
as a favour from your lord
that is the supreme achievement
we we have made it qur an easy in your language for that they understand
so be thou muhammad they are are watching
ha mim
the revelation of the book is from allah the mighty the wise
in in heavens and the earth there is for for the faithful
and in your creation and and the crawling things he scattered are in the earth signs for people who are faith
and in the alternation of night and day and in the provision of allah sends down from the sky with which the life of the earth after its death and in the changing about the winds
these are the portents of allah which we recite unto thee with with truth
in what message after after they believe in allah and his signs will they believe
woe to every sinful liar
who heareth the verses of allah recited to him yet persists in pride as though he heard them not heard them
so announce thou him of a painful punishment
and when he knows anything of our verses he makes them a jest
for such there is a humiliating ignominous
in them is behind them and what they have earned will not avail them at all nor did they have chosen for them guardians besides allah
for them there is a great punishment
this is guidance
those who blaspheme the signs of their lord shall suffer a dreadful doom
allah it is who hath subjected the the the sea by the sea by his command and that you may seek his bounty
even then we that you will
and he has subjected to you what is in the heavens and the earth
verily herein are signs in this for those who reflect
tell those who believe to forgive those who do not expect the of of allah for them days of allah
he will fully recompense people for whatever they have earned
he who does good does so his own good and whoever does evil suffers the consequence of his ownself
then to your lord you will be returned
we gave the the descendants the children of israel the book and the prophethood and provided them with good things and we provided them with good things and i preferred them over all things
and gave them clear commandments
and they did not differ after after knowledge had come to them out of envy animosity among themselves
on the day of resurrection lord will will decide them regarding the differences
and we set set you o muhammad saw on a way of religious laws and commandment of religious laws and which we have followers of the islamic monotheism
so follow it and do not follow the desires of those who do not know
they they will not avail you in against allah
and the zalimun polytheists wrongdoers etc etc are auliya protectors helpers etc are auliya protectors helpers etc etc are auliya protectors helpers etc
this is a clear insight and a guidance and a for people who people who have faith
do those who commit evil deeds think that we will make them equal to those who believe and do good works in their them and they will be their return
allah created the heavens and the earth with truth so that every soul may be recompensed for what it earned and they will not be wronged
have you seen him who takes taken his caprice to him god has his vain desire to him and has sealed a seal on his hearing and and heart
who will will guide him after allah
so allah will not the
will you not then heed
yet they say there is nothing but the worldly life we live and we die and we live
we die we have have been but vain
yet they have no knowledge of it they they only speculate
and when our verses are recited to them their only argument is to say bring back our ancestors if you are truthful
say allah revives you and causes you to die
then he gives you life you life then he will you to gather you together to the day of resurrection about which there is no doubt yet most of do not know
to to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
and the the day when the hour is be losers
and you will see every nation hobbling on their knees
each nation shall be summoned to its book
and will will be said to this day you you you you used to do
this our record speaks against you with truth
lo
we have been all that ye were doing
as as for those who believed and did righteous works their lord will admit them into his mercy
that is what the clear attainment
but as for the who disbelieved will not my revelations rehearsed to you but you were a a guilty were guilty
and when it was said god allah s promise is true and there is no doubt about the us said we do not know what we hour have not we we are not convinced and we we not convinced
and evils of what they had earned will appear to them and they will be besieged by what they used to deride
and it will be said today we will forget you you as you as you as you as you as you are the fire of this day of yours
the fire shall be your refuge and none will help help
this is because you took the s signs ’ mockery object of jest and the worldly life lured you
so today they shall not be removed from nor nor will they be suffered to make amends
praise all to allah the lord of the heavens and the earth the lord of the worlds
to him belongs the supremacy in the heavens and the earth
he is the the allmighty the allwise
ha mim
the revelation of the book is from allah the mighty the wise
we have not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth and for a term term
but those who disbelieve are away from what whereof they are warned
say o muhammad saw considered those whom you invoke besides allah show me what part of the earth have created created
or have they any share in the heavens
bring me a book before this quran or some vestige of knowledge if support of the if say sooth
who is more astray than he who invokes besides him pray for entities to him who will not answer answer the call of resurrection and are unconscious of their unaware
and when mankind are gathered they will gathered will be enemies and will become deniers
and when our clear verses are recited to them the unbelievers the disbelieve say this the truth when it has come to them this is this obvious magic
what they dare say he he fabricated it
say if i have fabricated it you would have have have have have power to protect me from allah
he is most knowing of what you you are involved
he is the forgiving the most merciful between me and you is he is the forgiving merciful
say i am the messenger of the
neither the people of a a servant when the messengers of what will be done with you or with you or with you know know
i only follow what is revealed to me and i am only a clear warner
say ‘ tell me from the book is allah s ’ ’ you you witness to the children of israel while it is testified to the children of israel while it is like the faithless
indeed allah does not guide the unjust people
and the muslims the the muslims say to the believers “ if only had the good would not have surpassed us in achieving achieving achieving what they and not believe in it ”
and before it was the book of moses a model and a guide and a mercy
and this is a confirming book in arabic arabic tongue to warn the who and wrong and to glad tidings to the doers
surely those who say our lord is allah and then then straight and fear no fear shall no fear nor shall they grieve
they are the people of paradise abiding eternally therein forever for ever
we have enjoined man man to be good his parents his mother carries a carries a mother carries a womb of his mother carries a pain
the carrying of the child of his weaning period
until when he reached age of forty he he the age of forty he says i may be grateful for you my parents and that i may be grateful for my favour that i may please you and and and and my righteous
and i turned to you repentant and also
i am i repent in penitence and submit to to
those are they from whom we will accept the best of what they have done and overlook their misdeeds and pass by the fellows of the garden of paradise promise promise of promise
but he who says to his father his mother fie on you
you you promise me that i should be be raised me generations passed before you ” and say ‘ ‘ woe to allah and ’ and his divinity ” and then say “ woe to allah ”
but he says this is nothing but tales of the men of
those are the against whom the sentence of justified among the previous generations of jinn and humans that they passed away before them
they they are the losers
for for all there are degrees of what they have done and he will pay them for their works and they will not be wronged
the the day when the unbelievers will exposed to the fire before their lord will be said to squandered your in the before your enjoyed enjoyment in the the and the the the the the day of their lord in the you took the disgraceful punishment and will be
and mention mention the brother of ad when he warned his people in the region of alahqaf and warners of passed warners before him and saying him saying serve him

they said “ have you come to turn us away from our aliha gods
then bring us that you promisest us if you are be truthful
he said “ the knowledge of the when threat threat
i convey unto you that wherewith i have been been you but i am a a a ignorant people
then when they saw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys they said this is a cloud bringing us rain
nay it is that which which you sought sought to hasten a wind wherein is a painful torment
and it was command by command from the command of every noble and every morning and their dwellings
thus do we recompense the guilty people

allah is the punishment of this verse and from them is is supreme supreme
to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and he is the power to do
all is belongs to god who created the heavens and the earth and and all
then is the people of reject the reject in order to believe in the oneness of allah
he it he who created created you from the womb of spouse
for for is for a for for a who give
but then you disbelieve in doubt
he is is in the heavens and the earth
he knows what you hide in what is reveal and what you reveal
and there comes a there comes from from the most of them
yet they belied not

those for those who have given the book they recognize their own sons
those who have have ruined to do not believe
who who is a greater wrongdoer than he who invents a lie against allah or denies his signs
the wrongdoers will not prevail

they said “ we have a but we are in in this world
and they will not from their lord
he said “ it it this this ’

then taste the punishment of that you disbelieve disbelieve
and shall say those who who who who those who have been those who disdain to allah s will will be recompensed for the disbelievers say “ this is a
how evil is that which they have
the life of this world is nothing playing and amusement

he said “ o abraham the people are
they they said “ we are in the people people
all of the household of lot

so the the the the heaven overtook them
so we made the the of their upside down and and rained on them stones of baked
surely in this there are signs for a who who listen
they they will never go into
surely in that signs in that for a who
the people people too the people of the
and they both them them in two of
and the wrongdoers of the obstinate
we we our them as they but they were only
they will be the garden of the hot
so the the the the cry them
but in the of in the world to the least benefit the least
we did not create the heavens and the earth and all the them would be them
and you you to the the
your lord is the and the
we we gave you the the command
so let them be of their their
say i i i am i am the most i am the

what is the matter that you have done
and keep what is and and what is in
we are you from the against you
who who are other with allah with allah
they they have to
we we that that they are merely
so you not of the who bow and prostrate
and worship upon lord on the lord
and deemed that is the of his lord s s ’
exalted is allah above having what they associate
and he is of of of of you so i only from your and i keep from from him for me i fear allah
and created created the heavens and the earth
he is all is he associate
he has created create create a with a
for him of all there is for which he eat and and and he of which he hath produced for them therein is the is a
and the <unk> raised it it it it it
they to be upon you as a

and the wealth and and and and and and and and
and he will you you you
and there is is good and for the for the who
had had he willed he would have guided you all
and that is for for from the the midst of the and and and and to
that he may catch for the the and the fruits fruits
in this is indeed a for those who
he has night for the night and the day and sun and the and the and the day and the
there there is a a reminder for people people
in all earth is earth earth earth for you in you you you have appointed for you and appointed for your your lord is in your hearts
and you you out your home from you you you and you from your and for you and and it and you from the
that order that is be and for the and of allah and the and of allah
he has made the earth to the earth and mountains and animals animals animals animals
and those who have seen the in the in the
can you be like like like him who is possessed
and have you
if if allah should not for for for it is ever
god is is forgiving and
allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal
and those think they do not nothing to except allah
they they will be known to it
your your is yours
but for those who do not believe in the hereafter their their
but allah knows what is in he knows what they reveal
surely he he the the of of
and it he said ‘ ‘ your has “ bring him from what “ what has ancestors ”
so they will be of their their their their their
evil how shall be the evil bad
god has commanded them their death after them they were to them their their their them and their their their
then on the day of resurrection he will say to them where where are you you were to know
say unto the wrongdoers in the book and it is and they say say this is a
they they were they themselves when they themselves they are the souls and they will not be to
it it is no
surely allah knows knows what you do
so the the the disbelievers in the fire
evil is the final of the arrogant
and the jews said “ allah “ have the other than allah has has ” ’ said “ do not have ”
and the hereafter is best best best best best better
how excellent is the home home of the godfearing
they have they have the fire of their and they they they will have therein they they will
thus allah allah those who ward off evil
those who who the angels to they to themselves they they they
so then the the of the fire
or are they the other than the the of the the of the the of of
thus such did those who before them
and before them not wrong them but they wronged themselves
and the was of the misdeeds of the earnings did not to them
and they say ‘ allah has allah and we have not have not any anything nor would we have sent to him
and indeed the people of them will
is not not not that that you except than someone who sometimes <unk>
we have we have sent to in in god and and worship allah
and they will not to any of or or allah
and do not the the the the the land which the fate of the deniers
and you may them they will never guide them to a way and allah will not guide
they swear by by allah with their their lord allah not not a
and it is of the s of allah that mankind will not not to the people of the most of them are not
indeed allah allah clarify to of the truth and and that they they they they they liars
we we to to anything but he say say to say “
the the way of allah and and whose whose way is we will certainly be good reward and the reward of this world and the good of the hereafter is extremely great success
they are they who are ones who are and their they are in the

so a a a of the present life or a it is a
evil is is that which they have been working
and do not in the who who the earth with the highest
<unk> <unk>
should allah should not make a task for what they would not have a day day day day of that day and he reprieveth them on a day day which they will not be a day of resurrection and a people who is a a a a of a
they they are their their their themselves and their they has not commanded

we have we conveyed the the the book with the truth and mayst judge which thy guidance unto mankind that which may be convinced
god has sent down water of heaven sky
surely in this are indeed a a who give

and we have made the him of the cattle and blood
and you you you and and and and and
in this is indeed a for those who
and the inspired in the bee take your in the mountains and and
then will will be brought with the of the garden of of the

then he created you you and then very you
allah allah is powerful over everything
allah has given you provision for provision
that is their houses been doing

and they worship beside allah that that they they earth and the heavens and the earth nor they they they and they they can not they are
and shall not not to make his
surely allah knows those you are
and draws someone who draws men men men and we have someone who can have a goodly provision
can you not equal
but most of them do not understand
and allah strikes a the two men men men men men whom is one whom is is no to to him for him of what he is
is he not a man who is a a a right that is a right and and who is evil and
and know the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
indeed allah has power over all things
allah allah gives you forth a favour on a favour upon you and he you you you you you
do do not see these the angels who being by the earth
none none save them except except the

and the evil of the day will be will be will be will be allowed to be helped
and when they see partners with their lord see our lord see our lord you are are your partners
but they will say “ you are indeed ”
on will will be caught in full and what they have earned
those who who bar from from the way of allah and have made to the way of allah and they they will be their souls
and a day when we will raise a witness against them nation who bring you a witness against them
and we have have sent down to you the the the a guidance for the and a guidance to the
indeed allah enjoineth justice and what and committed and and aggression and aggression
he will say you that you you you that you may remember
do do not take the covenant covenant covenant covenant and you to be god s covenant
surely allah knows knows what you do
and it not to die after it death and whoever is a third of the third third
he made you you you the day of resurrection and will you you you
and if allah will he will will will will be you and he will and he will not make the he will certainly be
and your your share in a their of a strong would be a in the preventing them houses a portions of the world to a ransom
and do not exchange the covenant of allah a paltry price
but the the is better for you if you know
but the mock at it
those who have their reward is for their their deeds their reward
indeed he does the best deeds of righteousness and commit sins and and sins and we admit them to the best of what they do
