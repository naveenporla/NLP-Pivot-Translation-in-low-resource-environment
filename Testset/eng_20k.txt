O mankind indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another
Indeed the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you
Indeed Allah is Knowing and Acquainted
The bedouins say We have believed
Say You have not yet believed but say instead We have submitted for faith has not yet entered your hearts
And if you obey Allah and His Messenger He will not deprive you from your deeds of anything
Indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
The believers are only the ones who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of Allah
It is those who are the truthful
Say Would you acquaint Allah with your religion while Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and Allah is Knowing of all things
They consider it a favor to you that they have accepted Islam
Say Do not consider your Islam a favor to me
Rather Allah has conferred favor upon you that He has guided you to the faith if you should be truthful
Indeed Allah knows the unseen aspects of the heavens and the earth
And Allah is Seeing of what you do
Qaf
By the honored Qur an
But they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves and the disbelievers say This is an amazing thing
When we have died and have become dust we will return to life
That is a distant return
We know what the earth diminishes of them and with Us is a retaining record
But they denied the truth when it came to them so they are in a confused condition
Have they not looked at the heaven above them how We structured it and adorned it and how it has no rifts
And the earth We spread it out and cast therein firmly set mountains and made grow therein something of every beautiful kind
Giving insight and a reminder for every servant who turns to Allah
And We have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest
And lofty palm trees having fruit arranged in layers
As provision for the servants and We have given life thereby to a dead land
Thus is the resurrection
The people of Noah denied before them and the companions of the well and Thamud
And Aad and Pharaoh and the brothers of Lot
And the companions of the thicket and the people of Tubba All denied the messengers so My threat was justly fulfilled
Did We fail in the first creation
But they are in confusion over a new creation
And We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him and We are closer to him than his jugular vein
When the two receivers receive seated on the right and on the left
Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared to record
And the intoxication of death will bring the truth that is what you were trying to avoid
And the Horn will be blown
That is the Day of carrying out the threat
And every soul will come with it a driver and a witness
It will be said You were certainly in unmindfulness of this and We have removed from you your cover so your sight this Day is sharp
And his companion the angel will say This record is what is with me prepared
Allah will say Throw into Hell every obstinate disbeliever
Preventer of good aggressor and doubter
Who made as equal with Allah another deity then throw him into the severe punishment
His devil companion will say Our Lord I did not make him transgress but he himself was in extreme error
Allah will say Do not dispute before Me while I had already presented to you the warning
The word will not be changed with Me and never will I be unjust to the servants
On the Day We will say to Hell Have you been filled and it will say Are there some more
And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous not far
It will be said This is what you were promised for every returner to Allah and keeper of His covenant
Who feared the Most Merciful unseen and came with a heart returning in repentance
Enter it in peace
This is the Day of Eternity
They will have whatever they wish therein and with Us is more
And how many a generation before them did We destroy who were greater than them in striking power and had explored throughout the lands Is there any place of escape
Indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present in mind
And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days and there touched Us no weariness
So be patient O Muhammad over what they say and exalt Allah with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting
And in part of the night exalt Him and after prostration
And listen on the Day when the Caller will call out from a place that is near
The Day they will hear the blast of the Horn in truth
That is the Day of Emergence from the graves
Indeed it is We who give life and cause death and to Us is the destination
On the Day the earth breaks away from them and they emerge rapidly that is a gathering easy for Us
We are most knowing of what they say and you are not over them a tyrant
But remind by the Qur an whoever fears My threat
By those winds scattering dust dispersing
And those clouds carrying a load of water
And those ships sailing with ease
And those angels apportioning each matter
Indeed what you are promised is true
And indeed the recompense is to occur
By the heaven containing pathways
Indeed you are in differing speech
Deluded away from the Qur an is he who is deluded
Destroyed are the falsifiers
Who are within a flood of confusion and heedless
They ask When is the Day of Recompense
It is the Day they will be tormented over the Fire
And will be told Taste your torment
This is that for which you were impatient
Indeed the righteous will be among gardens and springs
Accepting what their Lord has given them
Indeed they were before that doers of good
They used to sleep but little of the night
And in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness
And from their properties was given the right of the needy petitioner and the deprived
And on the earth are signs for the certain in faith
And in yourselves
Then will you not see
And in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised
Then by the Lord of the heaven and earth indeed it is truth just as sure as it is that you are speaking
Has there reached you the story of the honored guests of Abraham
When they entered upon him and said We greet you with peace He answered And upon you peace you are a people unknown
Then he went to his family and came with a fat roasted calf
And placed it near them he said Will you not eat
And he felt from them apprehension
They said Fear not and gave him good tidings of a learned boy
And his wife approached with a cry of alarm and struck her face and said I am a barren old woman
They said Thus has said your Lord indeed He is the Wise the Knowing
Abraham said Then what is your business here O messengers
They said Indeed we have been sent to a people of criminals
To send down upon them stones of clay
Marked in the presence of your Lord for the transgressors
So We brought out whoever was in the cities of the believers
And We found not within them other than a single house of Muslims
And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
And in Moses was a sign when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority
But he turned away with his supporters and said A magician or a madman
So We took him and his soldiers and cast them into the sea and he was blameworthy
And in Aad was a sign when We sent against them the barren wind
It left nothing of what it came upon but that it made it like disintegrated ruins
And in Thamud when it was said to them Enjoy yourselves for a time
But they were insolent toward the command of their Lord so the thunderbolt seized them while they were looking on
And they were unable to arise nor could they defend themselves
And We destroyed the people of Noah before indeed they were a people defiantly disobedient
And the heaven We constructed with strength and indeed We are its expander
And the earth We have spread out and excellent is the preparer
And of all things We created two mates perhaps you will remember
So flee to Allah
Indeed I am to you from Him a clear warner
And do not make as equal with Allah another deity
Indeed I am to you from Him a clear warner
Similarly there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said A magician or a madman
Did they suggest it to them
Rather they themselves are a transgressing people
So leave them O Muhammad for you are not to be blamed
And remind for indeed the reminder benefits the believers
And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me
I do not want from them any provision nor do I want them to feed Me
Indeed it is Allah who is the continual Provider the firm possessor of strength
And indeed for those who have wronged is a portion of punishment like the portion of their predecessors so let them not impatiently urge Me
And woe to those who have disbelieved from their Day which they are promised
By the mount
And by a Book inscribed
In parchment spread open
And by the frequented House
And by the heaven raised high
And by the sea filled with fire
Indeed the punishment of your Lord will occur
Of it there is no preventer
On the Day the heaven will sway with circular motion
And the mountains will pass on departing
Then woe that Day to the deniers
Who are in empty discourse amusing themselves
The Day they are thrust toward the fire of Hell with a violent thrust its angels will say
This is the Fire which you used to deny
Then is this magic or do you not see
Enter to burn therein then be patient or impatient it is all the same for you
You are only being recompensed for what you used to do
Indeed the righteous will be in gardens and pleasure
Enjoying what their Lord has given them and their Lord protected them from the punishment of Hellfire
They will be told Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do
They will be reclining on thrones lined up and We will marry them to fair women with large beautiful eyes
And those who believed and whose descendants followed them in faith We will join with them their descendants and We will not deprive them of anything of their deeds
Every person for what he earned is retained
And We will provide them with fruit and meat from whatever they desire
They will exchange with one another a cup of wine wherein results no ill speech or commission of sin
There will circulate among them servant boys especially for them as if they were pearls wellprotected
And they will approach one another inquiring of each other
They will say Indeed we were previously among our people fearful of displeasing Allah
So Allah conferred favor upon us and protected us from the punishment of the Scorching Fire
Indeed we used to supplicate Him before
Indeed it is He who is the Beneficent the Merciful
So remind O Muhammad for you are not by the favor of your Lord a soothsayer or a madman
Or do they say of you A poet for whom we await a misfortune of time
Say Wait for indeed I am with you among the waiters
Or do their minds command them to say this or are they a transgressing people
Or do they say He has made it up
Rather they do not believe
Then let them produce a statement like it if they should be truthful
Or were they created by nothing or were they the creators of themselves
Or did they create the heavens and the earth
Rather they are not certain
Or have they the depositories containing the provision of your Lord
Or are they the controllers of them
Or have they a stairway into the heaven upon which they listen
Then let their listener produce a clear authority
Or has He daughters while you have sons
Or do you O Muhammad ask of them a payment so they are by debt burdened down
Or have they knowledge of the unseen so they write it down
Or do they intend a plan
But those who disbelieve they are the object of a plan
Or have they a deity other than Allah
Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him
And if they were to see a fragment from the sky falling they would say It is merely clouds heaped up
So leave them until they meet their Day in which they will be struck insensible
The Day their plan will not avail them at all nor will they be helped
And indeed for those who have wronged is a punishment before that but most of them do not know
And be patient O Muhammad for the decision of your Lord for indeed you are in Our eyes
And exalt Allah with praise of your Lord when you arise
And in a part of the night exalt Him and after the setting of the stars
By the star when it descends
Your companion Muhammad has not strayed nor has he erred
Nor does he speak from his own inclination
It is not but a revelation revealed
Taught to him by one intense in strength
One of soundness And he rose to his true form
While he was in the higher part of the horizon
Then he approached and descended
And was at a distance of two bow lengths or nearer
And he revealed to His Servant what he revealed
The heart did not lie about what it saw
So will you dispute with him over what he saw
And he certainly saw him in another descent
At the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary
Near it is the Garden of Refuge
When there covered the Lote Tree that which covered it
The sight of the Prophet did not swerve nor did it transgress its limit
He certainly saw of the greatest signs of his Lord
So have you considered alLat and al Uzza
And Manat the third the other one
Is the male for you and for Him the female
That then is an unjust division
They are not but mere names you have named them you and your forefathers for which Allah has sent down no authority They follow not except assumption and what their souls desire and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance
Or is there for man whatever he wishes
Rather to Allah belongs the Hereafter and the first life
And how many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except only after Allah has permitted it to whom He wills and approves
Indeed those who do not believe in the Hereafter name the angels female names
And they have thereof no knowledge They follow not except assumption and indeed assumption avails not against the truth at all
So turn away from whoever turns his back on Our message and desires not except the worldly life
That is their sum of knowledge
Indeed your Lord is most knowing of who strays from His way and He is most knowing of who is guided
And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth that He may recompense those who do evil with the penalty of what they have done and recompense those who do good with the best reward
Those who avoid the major sins and immoralities only committing slight ones
Indeed your Lord is vast in forgiveness
He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers
So do not claim yourselves to be pure He is most knowing of who fears Him
Have you seen the one who turned away
And gave a little and then refrained
Does he have knowledge of the unseen so he sees
Or has he not been informed of what was in the scriptures of Moses
And of Abraham who fulfilled his obligations
That no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another
And that there is not for man except that good for which he strives
And that his effort is going to be seen
Then he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense
And that to your Lord is the finality
And that it is He who makes one laugh and weep
And that it is He who causes death and gives life
And that He creates the two mates the male and female
From a spermdrop when it is emitted
And that incumbent upon Him is the next creation
And that it is He who enriches and suffices
And that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius
And that He destroyed the first people of Aad
And Thamud and He did not spare them
And the people of Noah before Indeed it was they who were even more unjust and oppressing
And the overturned towns He hurled down
And covered them by that which He covered
Then which of the favors of your Lord do you doubt
This Prophet is a warner like the former warners
The Approaching Day has approached
Of it from those besides Allah there is no remover
Then at this statement do you wonder
And you laugh and do not weep
While you are proudly sporting
So prostrate to Allah and worship Him
The Hour has come near and the moon has split in two
And if they see a miracle they turn away and say Passing magic
And they denied and followed their inclinations
But for every matter is a time of settlement
And there has already come to them of information that in which there is deterrence
Extensive wisdom but warning does not avail them
So leave them O Muhammad
The Day the Caller calls to something forbidding
Their eyes humbled they will emerge from the graves as if they were locusts spreading
Racing ahead toward the Caller The disbelievers will say This is a difficult Day
The people of Noah denied before them and they denied Our servant and said A madman and he was repelled
So he invoked his Lord Indeed I am overpowered so help
Then We opened the gates of the heaven with rain pouring down
And caused the earth to burst with springs and the waters met for a matter already predestined
And We carried him on a construction of planks and nails
Sailing under Our observation as reward for he who had been denied
And We left it as a sign so is there any who will remember
And how severe were My punishment and warning
And We have certainly made the Qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
Aad denied and how severe were My punishment and warning
Indeed We sent upon them a screaming wind on a day of continuous misfortune
Extracting the people as if they were trunks of palm trees uprooted
And how severe were My punishment and warning
And We have certainly made the Qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
Thamud denied the warning
And said Is it one human being among us that we should follow
Indeed we would then be in error and madness
Has the message been sent down upon him from among us
Rather he is an insolent liar
They will know tomorrow who is the insolent liar
Indeed We are sending the shecamel as trial for them so watch them and be patient
And inform them that the water is shared between them each day of drink attended by turn
But they called their companion and he dared and hamstrung her
And how severe were My punishment and warning
Indeed We sent upon them one blast from the sky and they became like the dry twig fragments of an animal pen
And We have certainly made the Qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
The people of Lot denied the warning
Indeed We sent upon them a storm of stones except the family of Lot We saved them before dawn
As favor from us
Thus do We reward he who is grateful
And he had already warned them of Our assault but they disputed the warning
And they had demanded from him his guests but We obliterated their eyes saying Taste My punishment and warning
And there came upon them by morning an abiding punishment
So taste My punishment and warning
And We have certainly made the Qur an easy for remembrance so is there any who will remember
And there certainly came to the people of Pharaoh warning
They denied Our signs all of them so We seized them with a seizure of one Exalted in Might and Perfect in Ability
Are your disbelievers better than those former ones or have you immunity in the scripture
Or do they say We are an assembly supporting each other
Their assembly will be defeated and they will turn their backs in retreat
But the Hour is their appointment for due punishment and the Hour is more disastrous and more bitter
Indeed the criminals are in error and madness
The Day they are dragged into the Fire on their faces it will be said Taste the touch of Saqar
Indeed all things We created with predestination
And Our command is but one like a glance of the eye
And We have already destroyed your kinds so is there any who will remember
And everything they did is in written records
And every small and great thing is inscribed
Indeed the righteous will be among gardens and rivers
In a seat of honor near a Sovereign Perfect in Ability
The Most Merciful
Taught the Qur an
Created man
And taught him eloquence
The sun and the moon move by precise calculation
And the stars and trees prostrate
And the heaven He raised and imposed the balance
That you not transgress within the balance
And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance
And the earth He laid out for the creatures
Therein is fruit and palm trees having sheaths of dates
And grain having husks and scented plants
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
He created man from clay like that of pottery
And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
He is Lord of the two sunrises and Lord of the two sunsets
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
He released the two seas meeting side by side
Between them is a barrier so neither of them transgresses
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
From both of them emerge pearl and coral
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
And to Him belong the ships with sails elevated in the sea like mountains
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Everyone upon the earth will perish
And there will remain the Face of your Lord Owner of Majesty and Honor
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Whoever is within the heavens and earth asks Him every day He is bringing about a matter
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
We will attend to you O prominent beings
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
O company of jinn and mankind if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth then pass
You will not pass except by authority from Allah
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
There will be sent upon you a flame of fire and smoke and you will not defend yourselves
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
And when the heaven is split open and becomes rosecolored like oil
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Then on that Day none will be asked about his sin among men or jinn
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
The criminals will be known by their marks and they will be seized by the forelocks and the feet
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
This is Hell which the criminals deny
They will go around between it and scalding water heated to the utmost degree
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
But for he who has feared the position of his Lord are two gardens
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Having spreading branches
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In both of them are two springs flowing
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In both of them are of every fruit two kinds
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
They are reclining on beds whose linings are of silk brocade and the fruit of the two gardens is hanging low
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In them are women limiting their glances untouched before them by man or jinni
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
As if they were rubies and coral
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Is the reward for good anything but good
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
And below them both in excellence are two other gardens
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Dark green in color
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In both of them are two springs spouting
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In both of them are fruit and palm trees and pomegranates
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
In them are good and beautiful women
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Fair ones reserved in pavilions
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Untouched before them by man or jinni
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Reclining on green cushions and beautiful fine carpets
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny
Blessed is the name of your Lord Owner of Majesty and Honor
When the Occurrence occurs
There is at its occurrence no denial
It will bring down some and raise up others
When the earth is shaken with convulsion
And the mountains are broken down crumbling
And become dust dispersing
And you become of three kinds
Then the companions of the right what are the companions of the right
And the companions of the left what are the companions of the left
And the forerunners the forerunners
Those are the ones brought near to Allah
In the Gardens of Pleasure
A large company of the former peoples
And a few of the later peoples
On thrones woven with ornament
Reclining on them facing each other
There will circulate among them young boys made eternal
With vessels pitchers and a cup of wine from a flowing spring
No headache will they have therefrom nor will they be intoxicated
And fruit of what they select
And the meat of fowl from whatever they desire
And for them are fair women with large beautiful eyes
The likenesses of pearls wellprotected
As reward for what they used to do
They will not hear therein ill speech or commission of sin
Only a saying Peace peace
The companions of the right what are the companions of the right
They will be among lote trees with thorns removed
And banana trees layered with fruit
And shade extended
And water poured out
And fruit abundant and varied
Neither limited to season nor forbidden
And upon beds raised high
Indeed We have produced the women of Paradise in a new creation
And made them virgins
Devoted to their husbands and of equal age
For the companions of the right who are
A company of the former peoples
And a company of the later peoples
And the companions of the left what are the companions of the left
They will be in scorching fire and scalding water
And a shade of black smoke
Neither cool nor beneficial
Indeed they were before that indulging in affluence
And they used to persist in the great violation
And they used to say When we die and become dust and bones are we indeed to be resurrected
And our forefathers as well
Say O Muhammad Indeed the former and the later peoples
Are to be gathered together for the appointment of a known Day
Then indeed you O those astray who are deniers
Will be eating from trees of zaqqum
And filling with it your bellies
And drinking on top of it from scalding water
And will drink as the drinking of thirsty camels
That is their accommodation on the Day of Recompense
We have created you so why do you not believe
Have you seen that which you emit
Is it you who creates it or are We the Creator
We have decreed death among you and We are not to be outdone
In that We will change your likenesses and produce you in that form which you do not know
And you have already known the first creation so will you not remember
And have you seen that seed which you sow
Is it you who makes it grow or are We the grower
If We willed We could make it dry debris and you would remain in wonder
Saying Indeed we are now in debt
Rather we have been deprived
And have you seen the water that you drink
Is it you who brought it down from the clouds or is it We who bring it down
If We willed We could make it bitter so why are you not grateful
And have you seen the fire that you ignite
Is it you who produced its tree or are We the producer
We have made it a reminder and provision for the travelers
So exalt the name of your Lord the Most Great
Then I swear by the setting of the stars
And indeed it is an oath if you could know most great
Indeed it is a noble Qur an
In a Register wellprotected
None touch it except the purified
It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
Then is it to this statement that you are indifferent
And make the thanks for your provision that you deny the Provider
Then why when the soul at death reaches the throat
And you are at that time looking on
And Our angels are nearer to him than you but you do not see
Then why do you not if you are not to be recompensed
Bring it back if you should be truthful
And if the deceased was of those brought near to Allah
Then for him is rest and bounty and a garden of pleasure
And if he was of the companions of the right
Then the angels will say Peace for you you are from the companions of the right
But if he was of the deniers who were astray
Then for him is accommodation of scalding water
And burning in Hellfire
Indeed this is the true certainty
So exalt the name of your Lord the Most Great
Whatever is in the heavens and earth exalts Allah and He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
His is the dominion of the heavens and earth
He gives life and causes death and He is over all things competent
He is the First and the Last the Ascendant and the Intimate and He is of all things Knowing
It is He who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne
He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein and He is with you wherever you are
And Allah of what you do is Seeing
His is the dominion of the heavens and earth
And to Allah are returned all matters
He causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and he is Knowing of that within the breasts
Believe in Allah and His Messenger and spend out of that in which He has made you successors
For those who have believed among you and spent there will be a great reward
And why do you not believe in Allah while the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord and He has taken your covenant if you should truly be believers
It is He who sends down upon His Servant Muhammad verses of clear evidence that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light
And indeed Allah is to you Kind and Merciful
And why do you not spend in the cause of Allah while to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth
Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest of Makkah and fought and those who did so after it
Those are greater in degree than they who spent afterwards and fought
But to all Allah has promised the best reward
And Allah with what you do is Acquainted
Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He will multiply it for him and he will have a noble reward
On the Day you see the believing men and believing women their light proceeding before them and on their right it will be said Your good tidings today are of gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein you will abide eternally
That is what is the great attainment
On the same Day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believed Wait for us that we may acquire some of your light
It will be said Go back behind you and seek light
And a wall will be placed between them with a door its interior containing mercy but on the outside of it is torment
The hypocrites will call to the believers Were we not with you
They will say Yes but you afflicted yourselves and awaited misfortune for us and doubted and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command of Allah
And the Deceiver deceived you concerning Allah
So today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved
Your refuge is the Fire
It is most worthy of you and wretched is the destination
Has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of the truth
And let them not be like those who were given the Scripture before and a long period passed over them so their hearts hardened and many of them are defiantly disobedient
Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its lifelessness
We have made clear to you the signs perhaps you will understand
Indeed the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and they who have loaned Allah a goodly loan it will be multiplied for them and they will have a noble reward
And those who have believed in Allah and His messengers those are in the ranks of the supporters of truth and the martyrs with their Lord
For them is their reward and their light
But those who have disbelieved and denied Our verses those are the companions of Hellfire
Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and children like the example of a rain whose resulting plant growth pleases the tillers then it dries and you see it turned yellow then it becomes scattered debris
And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from Allah and approval
And what is the worldly life except the enjoyment of delusion
Race toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth prepared for those who believed in Allah and His messengers
That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills and Allah is the possessor of great bounty
No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being indeed that for Allah is easy
In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult in pride over what He has given you
And Allah does not like everyone selfdeluded and boastful
Those who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess
And whoever turns away then indeed Allah is the Free of need the Praiseworthy
We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain their affairs in justice
And We sent down iron wherein is great military might and benefits for the people and so that Allah may make evident those who support Him and His messengers unseen
Indeed Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might
And We have already sent Noah and Abraham and placed in their descendants prophethood and scripture and among them is he who is guided but many of them are defiantly disobedient
Then We sent following their footsteps Our messengers and followed them with Jesus the son of Mary and gave him the Gospel
And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism which they innovated We did not prescribe it for them except that they did so seeking the approval of Allah
But they did not observe it with due observance
So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward but many of them are defiantly disobedient
O you who have believed fear Allah and believe in His Messenger He will then give you a double portion of His mercy and make for you a light by which you will walk and forgive you and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
This is so that the People of the Scripture may know that they are not able to obtain anything from the bounty of Allah and that all bounty is in the hand of Allah He gives it to whom He wills And Allah is the possessor of great bounty
Certainly has Allah heard the speech of the one who argues with you O Muhammad concerning her husband and directs her complaint to Allah
And Allah hears your dialogue indeed Allah is Hearing and Seeing
Those who pronounce thihar among you to separate from their wives they are not consequently their mothers
Their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them
And indeed they are saying an objectionable statement and a falsehood
But indeed Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving
And those who pronounce thihar from their wives and then wish to go back on what they said then there must be the freeing of a slave before they touch one another
That is what you are admonished thereby and Allah is Acquainted with what you do
And he who does not find a slave then a fast for two months consecutively before they touch one another and he who is unable then the feeding of sixty poor persons
That is for you to believe completely in Allah and His Messenger and those are the limits set by Allah
And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment
Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Messenger are abased as those before them were abased
And We have certainly sent down verses of clear evidence
And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment
On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did
Allah had enumerated it while they forgot it and Allah is over all things Witness
Have you not considered that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth
There is in no private conversation three but that He is the fourth of them nor are there five but that He is the sixth of them and no less than that and no more except that He is with them in knowledge wherever they are
Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection
Indeed Allah is of all things Knowing
Have you not considered those who were forbidden from private conversation then they return to that which they were forbidden and converse among themselves about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger
And when they come to you they greet you with that word by which Allah does not greet you and say among themselves Why does Allah not punish us for what we say
Sufficient for them is Hell which they will enter to burn and wretched is the destination
O you who have believed when you converse privately do not converse about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger but converse about righteousness and piety And fear Allah to whom you will be gathered
Private conversation is only from Satan that he may grieve those who have believed but he will not harm them at all except by permission of Allah
And upon Allah let the believers rely
O you who have believed when you are told Space yourselves in assemblies then make space Allah will make space for you
And when you are told Arise then arise Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees
And Allah is Acquainted with what you do
O you who have believed when you wish to privately consult the Messenger present before your consultation a charity
That is better for you and purer
But if you find not the means then indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
Have you feared to present before your consultation charities
Then when you do not and Allah has forgiven you then at least establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger
And Allah is Acquainted with what you do
Have you not considered those who make allies of a people with whom Allah has become angry
They are neither of you nor of them and they swear to untruth while they know they are lying
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment
Indeed it was evil that they were doing
They took their false oaths as a cover so they averted people from the way of Allah and for them is a humiliating punishment
Never will their wealth or their children avail them against Allah at all
Those are the companions of the Fire they will abide therein eternally
On the Day Allah will resurrect them all and they will swear to Him as they swear to you and think that they are standing on something
Unquestionably it is they who are the liars
Satan has overcome them and made them forget the remembrance of Allah
Those are the party of Satan
Unquestionably the party of Satan they will be the losers
Indeed the ones who oppose Allah and His Messenger those will be among the most humbled
Allah has written I will surely overcome I and My messengers
Indeed Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might
You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred
Those He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from Him
And We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they abide eternally
Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him those are the party of Allah
Unquestionably the party of Allah they are the successful
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts Allah and He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
It is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture from their homes at the first gathering You did not think they would leave and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from Allah but the decree of Allah came upon them from where they had not expected and He cast terror into their hearts so they destroyed their houses by their own hands and the hands of the believers So take warning O people of vision
And if not that Allah had decreed for them evacuation He would have punished them in this world and for them in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire
That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger
And whoever opposes Allah then indeed Allah is severe in penalty
Whatever you have cut down of their palm trees or left standing on their trunks it was by permission of Allah and so He would disgrace the defiantly disobedient
And what Allah restored of property to His Messenger from them you did not spur for it in an expedition any horses or camels but Allah gives His messengers power over whom He wills and Allah is over all things competent
And what Allah restored to His Messenger from the people of the towns it is for Allah and for the Messenger and for his near relatives and orphans and the stranded traveler so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you
And whatever the Messenger has given you take and what he has forbidden you refrain from
And fear Allah indeed Allah is severe in penalty
For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties seeking bounty from Allah and His approval and supporting Allah and His Messenger there is also a share Those are the truthful
And also for those who were settled in alMadinah and adopted the faith before them They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what the emigrants were given but give them preference over themselves even though they are in privation
And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
And there is a share for those who came after them saying Our Lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts any resentment toward those who have believed Our Lord indeed You are Kind and Merciful
Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy saying to their brothers who have disbelieved among the People of the Scripture If you are expelled we will surely leave with you and we will not obey in regard to you anyone ever and if you are fought we will surely aid you
But Allah testifies that they are liars
If they are expelled they will not leave with them and if they are fought they will not aid them
And even if they should aid them they will surely turn their backs then thereafter they will not be aided
You believers are more fearful within their breasts than Allah
That is because they are a people who do not understand
They will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls
Their violence among themselves is severe
You think they are together but their hearts are diverse
That is because they are a people who do not reason
Theirs is like the example of those shortly before them they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have a painful punishment
The hypocrites are like the example of Satan when he says to man Disbelieve
But when he disbelieves he says Indeed I am disassociated from you
Indeed I fear Allah Lord of the worlds
So the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the Fire abiding eternally therein
And that is the recompense of the wrongdoers
O you who have believed fear Allah
And let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow and fear Allah
Indeed Allah is Acquainted with what you do
And be not like those who forgot Allah so He made them forget themselves
Those are the defiantly disobedient
Not equal are the companions of the Fire and the companions of Paradise
The companions of Paradise they are the attainers of success
If We had sent down this Qur an upon a mountain you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of Allah
And these examples We present to the people that perhaps they will give thought
He is Allah other than whom there is no deity Knower of the unseen and the witnessed
He is the Entirely Merciful the Especially Merciful
He is Allah other than whom there is no deity the Sovereign the Pure the Perfection the Bestower of Faith the Overseer the Exalted in Might the Compeller the Superior
Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him
He is Allah the Creator the Inventor the Fashioner to Him belong the best names
Whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting Him
And He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
O you who have believed do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth having driven out the Prophet and yourselves only because you believe in Allah your Lord
If you have come out for jihad in My cause and seeking means to My approval take them not as friends
You confide to them affection but I am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared
And whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way
If they gain dominance over you they would be to you as enemies and extend against you their hands and their tongues with evil and they wish you would disbelieve
Never will your relatives or your children benefit you the Day of Resurrection He will judge between you
And Allah of what you do is Seeing
There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people Indeed we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah We have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone except for the saying of Abraham to his father I will surely ask forgiveness for you but I have not power to do for you anything against Allah Our Lord upon You we have relied and to You we have returned and to You is the destination
Our Lord make us not objects of torment for the disbelievers and forgive us our Lord Indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might the Wise
There has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day
And whoever turns away then indeed Allah is the Free of need the Praiseworthy
Perhaps Allah will put between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them affection
And Allah is competent and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them
Indeed Allah loves those who act justly
Allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion forbids that you make allies of them
And whoever makes allies of them then it is those who are the wrongdoers
O you who have believed when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them
Allah is most knowing as to their faith
And if you know them to be believers then do not return them to the disbelievers they are not lawful wives for them nor are they lawful husbands for them
But give the disbelievers what they have spent
And there is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their due compensation
And hold not to marriage bonds with disbelieving women but ask for what you have spent and let them ask for what they have spent
That is the judgement of Allah He judges between you
And Allah is Knowing and Wise
And if you have lost any of your wives to the disbelievers and you subsequently obtain something then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent
And fear Allah in whom you are believers
O Prophet when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with Allah nor will they steal nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse nor will they kill their children nor will they bring forth a slander they have invented between their arms and legs nor will they disobey you in what is right then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them of Allah
Indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
O you who have believed do not make allies of a people with whom Allah has become angry
They have despaired of reward in the Hereafter just as the disbelievers have despaired of meeting the inhabitants of the graves
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts Allah and He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
O you who have believed why do you say what you do not do
Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do
Indeed Allah loves those who fight in His cause in a row as though they are a single structure joined firmly
And mention O Muhammad when Moses said to his people O my people why do you harm me while you certainly know that I am the messenger of Allah to you
And when they deviated Allah caused their hearts to deviate
And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
And mention when Jesus the son of Mary said O children of Israel indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me whose name is Ahmad
But when he came to them with clear evidences they said This is obvious magic
And who is more unjust than one who invents about Allah untruth while he is being invited to Islam
And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths but Allah will perfect His light although the disbelievers dislike it
It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion although those who associate others with Allah dislike it
O you who have believed shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment
It is that you believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives
That is best for you if you should know
He will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence
That is the great attainment
And you will obtain another favor that you love victory from Allah and an imminent conquest and give good tidings to the believers
O you who have believed be supporters of Allah as when Jesus the son of Mary said to the disciples Who are my supporters for Allah The disciples said We are supporters of Allah
And a faction of the Children of Israel believed and a faction disbelieved
So We supported those who believed against their enemy and they became dominant
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allah the Sovereign the Pure the Exalted in Might the Wise
It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom although they were before in clear error
And to others of them who have not yet joined them And He is the Exalted in Might the Wise
That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills and Allah is the possessor of great bounty
The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not take it on is like that of a donkey who carries volumes of books
Wretched is the example of the people who deny the signs of Allah
And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people
Say O you who are Jews if you claim that you are allies of Allah excluding the other people then wish for death if you should be truthful
But they will not wish for it ever because of what their hands have put forth
And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers
Say Indeed the death from which you flee indeed it will meet you
Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed and He will inform you about what you used to do
O you who have believed when the adhan is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu ah Friday then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade
That is better for you if you only knew
And when the prayer has been concluded disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of Allah and remember Allah often that you may succeed
But when they saw a transaction or a diversion O Muhammad they rushed to it and left you standing Say What is with Allah is better than diversion and than a transaction and Allah is the best of providers
When the hypocrites come to you O Muhammad they say We testify that you are the Messenger of Allah
And Allah knows that you are His Messenger and Allah testifies that the hypocrites are liars
They have taken their oaths as a cover so they averted people from the way of Allah
Indeed it was evil that they were doing
That is because they believed and then they disbelieved so their hearts were sealed over and they do not understand
And when you see them their forms please you and if they speak you listen to their speech
They are as if they were pieces of wood propped up they think that every shout is against them
They are the enemy so beware of them
May Allah destroy them how are they deluded
And when it is said to them Come the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you they turn their heads aside and you see them evading while they are arrogant
It is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them never will Allah forgive them
Indeed Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people
They are the ones who say Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah until they disband
And to Allah belongs the depositories of the heavens and the earth but the hypocrites do not understand
They say If we return to alMadinah the more honored for power will surely expel therefrom the more humble
And to Allah belongs all honor and to His Messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know
O you who have believed let not your wealth and your children divert you from remembrance of Allah
And whoever does that then those are the losers
And spend in the way of Allah from what We have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says My Lord if only You would delay me for a brief term so I would give charity and be among the righteous
But never will Allah delay a soul when its time has come
And Allah is Acquainted with what you do
Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allah
To Him belongs dominion and to Him belongs all praise and He is over all things competent
It is He who created you and among you is the disbeliever and among you is the believer
And Allah of what you do is Seeing
He created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms and to Him is the final destination
He knows what is within the heavens and earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare
And Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts
Has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before
So they tasted the bad consequence of their affair and they will have a painful punishment
That is because their messengers used to come to them with clear evidences but they said Shall human beings guide us and disbelieved and turned away
And Allah dispensed with them and Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy
Those who disbelieve have claimed that they will never be resurrected
Say Yes by my Lord you will surely be resurrected then you will surely be informed of what you did
And that for Allah is easy
So believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Qur an which We have sent down
And Allah is Acquainted with what you do
The Day He will assemble you for the Day of Assembly that is the Day of Deprivation
And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness He will remove from him his misdeeds and admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever
That is the great attainment
But the ones who disbelieved and denied Our verses those are the companions of the Fire abiding eternally therein and wretched is the destination
No disaster strikes except by permission of Allah
And whoever believes in Allah He will guide his heart
And Allah is Knowing of all things
And obey Allah and obey the Messenger but if you turn away then upon Our Messenger is only the duty of clear notification
Allah there is no deity except Him
And upon Allah let the believers rely
O you who have believed indeed among your wives and your children are enemies to you so beware of them But if you pardon and overlook and forgive then indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
Your wealth and your children are but a trial and Allah has with Him a great reward
So fear Allah as much as you are able and listen and obey and spend in the way of Allah it is better for your selves
And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be the successful
If you loan Allah a goodly loan He will multiply it for you and forgive you
And Allah is Most Appreciative and Forbearing
Knower of the unseen and the witnessed the Exalted in Might the Wise
O Prophet when you Muslims divorce women divorce them for the commencement of their waiting period and keep count of the waiting period and fear Allah your Lord
Do not turn them out of their husbands houses nor should they themselves leave during that period unless they are committing a clear immorality
And those are the limits set by Allah
And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself
You know not perhaps Allah will bring about after that a different matter
And when they have nearly fulfilled their term either retain them according to acceptable terms or part with them according to acceptable terms
And bring to witness two just men from among you and establish the testimony for the acceptance of Allah
That is instructed to whoever should believe in Allah and the Last day
And whoever fears Allah He will make for him a way out
And will provide for him from where he does not expect
And whoever relies upon Allah then He is sufficient for him
Indeed Allah will accomplish His purpose
Allah has already set for everything a decreed extent
And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women if you doubt then their period is three months and also for those who have not menstruated
And for those who are pregnant their term is until they give birth
And whoever fears Allah He will make for him of his matter ease
That is the command of Allah which He has sent down to you and whoever fears Allah He will remove for him his misdeeds and make great for him his reward
Lodge them in a section of where you dwell out of your means and do not harm them in order to oppress them
And if they should be pregnant then spend on them until they give birth
And if they breastfeed for you then give them their payment and confer among yourselves in the acceptable way but if you are in discord then there may breastfeed for the father another woman
Let a man of wealth spend from his wealth and he whose provision is restricted let him spend from what Allah has given him
Allah does not charge a soul except according to what He has given it
Allah will bring about after hardship ease
And how many a city was insolent toward the command of its Lord and His messengers so We took it to severe account and punished it with a terrible punishment
And it tasted the bad consequence of its affair and the outcome of its affair was loss
Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment so fear Allah O you of understanding who have believed
Allah has sent down to you the Qur an
He sent a Messenger Muhammad reciting to you the distinct verses of Allah that He may bring out those who believe and do righteous deeds from darknesses into the light
And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein forever
Allah will have perfected for him a provision
It is Allah who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like of them
His command descends among them so you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah has encompassed all things in knowledge
O Prophet why do you prohibit yourself from what Allah has made lawful for you seeking the approval of your wives
And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
Allah has already ordained for you Muslims the dissolution of your oaths
And Allah is your protector and He is the Knowing the Wise
And remember when the Prophet confided to one of his wives a statement and when she informed another of it and Allah showed it to him he made known part of it and ignored a part
And when he informed her about it she said Who told you this He said I was informed by the Knowing the Acquainted
If you two wives repent to Allah it is best for your hearts have deviated But if you cooperate against him then indeed Allah is his protector and Gabriel and the righteous of the believers and the angels moreover are his assistants
Perhaps his Lord if he divorced you all would substitute for him wives better than you submitting to Allah believing devoutly obedient repentant worshipping and traveling ones previously married and virgins
O you who have believed protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones over which are appointed angels harsh and severe they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded
O you who have disbelieved make no excuses that Day
You will only be recompensed for what you used to do
O you who have believed repent to Allah with sincere repentance
Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him
Their light will proceed before them and on their right they will say Our Lord perfect for us our light and forgive us
Indeed You are over all things competent
O Prophet strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them And their refuge is Hell and wretched is the destination
Allah presents an example of those who disbelieved the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot
They were under two of Our righteous servants but betrayed them so those prophets did not avail them from Allah at all and it was said Enter the Fire with those who enter
And Allah presents an example of those who believed the wife of Pharaoh when she said My Lord build for me near You a house in Paradise and save me from Pharaoh and his deeds and save me from the wrongdoing people
And the example of Mary the daughter of Imran who guarded her chastity so We blew into her garment through Our angel and she believed in the words of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient
Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion and He is over all things competent
He who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed and He is the Exalted in Might the Forgiving
And who created seven heavens in layers
You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency
So return your vision to the sky do you see any breaks
Then return your vision twice again
Your vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued
And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with stars and have made from them what is thrown at the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze
And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment of Hell and wretched is the destination
When they are thrown into it they hear from it a dreadful inhaling while it boils up
It almost bursts with rage
Every time a company is thrown into it its keepers ask them Did there not come to you a warner
They will say Yes a warner had come to us but we denied and said Allah has not sent down anything
You are not but in great error
And they will say If only we had been listening or reasoning we would not be among the companions of the Blaze
And they will admit their sin so it is alienation for the companions of the Blaze
Indeed those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward
And conceal your speech or publicize it indeed He is Knowing of that within the breasts
Does He who created not know while He is the Subtle the Acquainted
It is He who made the earth tame for you so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision and to Him is the resurrection
Do you feel secure that He who holds authority in the heaven would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would sway
Or do you feel secure that He who holds authority in the heaven would not send against you a storm of stones
Then you would know how severe was My warning
And already had those before them denied and how terrible was My reproach
Do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread and sometimes folded in
None holds them aloft except the Most Merciful
Indeed He is of all things Seeing
Or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than the Most Merciful
The disbelievers are not but in delusion
Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision
But they have persisted in insolence and aversion
Then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path
Say It is He who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts little are you grateful
Say It is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth and to Him you will be gathered
And they say When is this promise if you should be truthful
Say The knowledge is only with Allah and I am only a clear warner
But when they see it approaching the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed and it will be said This is that for which you used to call
Say O Muhammad Have you considered whether Allah should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment
Say He is the Most Merciful we have believed in Him and upon Him we have relied
And you will come to know who it is that is in clear error
Say Have you considered if your water was to become sunken into the earth then who could bring you flowing water
Nun
By the pen and what they inscribe
You are not O Muhammad by the favor of your Lord a madman
And indeed for you is a reward uninterrupted
And indeed you are of a great moral character
So you will see and they will see
Which of you is the afflicted by a devil
Indeed your Lord is most knowing of who has gone astray from His way and He is most knowing of the rightly guided
Then do not obey the deniers
They wish that you would soften in your position so they would soften toward you
And do not obey every worthless habitual swearer
And scorner going about with malicious gossip
A preventer of good transgressing and sinful
Cruel moreover and an illegitimate pretender
Because he is a possessor of wealth and children
When Our verses are recited to him he says Legends of the former peoples
We will brand him upon the snout
Indeed We have tried them as We tried the companions of the garden when they swore to cut its fruit in the early morning
Without making exception
So there came upon the garden an affliction from your Lord while they were asleep
And it became as though reaped
And they called one another at morning
Saying Go early to your crop if you would cut the fruit
So they set out while lowering their voices
Saying There will surely not enter it today upon you any poor person
And they went early in determination assuming themselves able
But when they saw it they said Indeed we are lost
Rather we have been deprived
The most moderate of them said Did I not say to you Why do you not exalt Allah
They said Exalted is our Lord
Indeed we were wrongdoers
Then they approached one another blaming each other
They said O woe to us indeed we were transgressors
Perhaps our Lord will substitute for us one better than it
Indeed we are toward our Lord desirous
Such is the punishment of this world
And the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they only knew
Indeed for the righteous with their Lord are the Gardens of Pleasure
Then will We treat the Muslims like the criminals
What is the matter with you
How do you judge
Or do you have a scripture in which you learn
That indeed for you is whatever you choose
Or do you have oaths binding upon Us extending until the Day of Resurrection that indeed for you is whatever you judge
Ask them which of them for that claim is responsible
Or do they have partners Then let them bring their partners if they should be truthful
The Day the shin will be uncovered and they are invited to prostration but the disbelievers will not be able
Their eyes humbled humiliation will cover them
And they used to be invited to prostration while they were sound
So leave Me O Muhammad with the matter of whoever denies the Qur an
We will progressively lead them to punishment from where they do not know
And I will give them time
Indeed My plan is firm
Or do you ask of them a payment so they are by debt burdened down
Or have they knowledge of the unseen so they write it down
Then be patient for the decision of your Lord O Muhammad and be not like the companion of the fish when he called out while he was distressed
If not that a favor from his Lord overtook him he would have been thrown onto the naked shore while he was censured
And his Lord chose him and made him of the righteous
And indeed those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes when they hear the message and they say Indeed he is mad
But it is not except a reminder to the worlds
The Inevitable Reality
What is the Inevitable Reality
And what can make you know what is the Inevitable Reality
Thamud and Aad denied the Striking Calamity
So as for Thamud they were destroyed by the overpowering blast
And as for Aad they were destroyed by a screaming violent wind
Which Allah imposed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so you would see the people therein fallen as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees
Then do you see of them any remains
And there came Pharaoh and those before him and the overturned cities with sin
And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord so He seized them with a seizure exceeding in severity
Indeed when the water overflowed We carried your ancestors in the sailing ship
That We might make it for you a reminder and that a conscious ear would be conscious of it
Then when the Horn is blown with one blast
And the earth and the mountains are lifted and leveled with one blow
Then on that Day the Resurrection will occur
And the heaven will split open for that Day it is infirm
And the angels are at its edges And there will bear the Throne of your Lord above them that Day eight of them
That Day you will be exhibited for judgement not hidden among you is anything concealed
So as for he who is given his record in his right hand he will say Here read my record
Indeed I was certain that I would be meeting my account
So he will be in a pleasant life
In an elevated garden
Its fruit to be picked hanging near
They will be told Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put forth in the days past
But as for he who is given his record in his left hand he will say Oh I wish I had not been given my record
And had not known what is my account
I wish my death had been the decisive one
My wealth has not availed me
Gone from me is my authority
Allah will say Seize him and shackle him
Then into Hellfire drive him
Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits insert him
Indeed he did not used to believe in Allah the Most Great
Nor did he encourage the feeding of the poor
So there is not for him here this Day any devoted friend
Nor any food except from the discharge of wounds
None will eat it except the sinners
So I swear by what you see
And what you do not see
That indeed the Qur an is the word of a noble Messenger
And it is not the word of a poet little do you believe
Nor the word of a soothsayer little do you remember
It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
And if Muhammad had made up about Us some false sayings
We would have seized him by the right hand
Then We would have cut from him the aorta
And there is no one of you who could prevent Us from him
And indeed the Qur an is a reminder for the righteous
And indeed We know that among you are deniers
And indeed it will be a cause of regret upon the disbelievers
And indeed it is the truth of certainty
So exalt the name of your Lord the Most Great
A supplicant asked for a punishment bound to happen
To the disbelievers of it there is no preventer
It is from Allah owner of the ways of ascent
The angels and the Spirit will ascend to Him during a Day the extent of which is fifty thousand years
So be patient with gracious patience
Indeed they see it as distant
But We see it as near
On the Day the sky will be like murky oil
And the mountains will be like wool
And no friend will ask anything of a friend
They will be shown each other The criminal will wish that he could be ransomed from the punishment of that Day by his children
And his wife and his brother
And his nearest kindred who shelter him
And whoever is on earth entirely so then it could save him
No
Indeed it is the Flame of Hell
A remover of exteriors
It invites he who turned his back on truth and went away from obedience
And collected wealth and hoarded
Indeed mankind was created anxious
When evil touches him impatient
And when good touches him withholding of it
Except the observers of prayer
Those who are constant in their prayer
And those within whose wealth is a known right
For the petitioner and the deprived
And those who believe in the Day of Recompense
And those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord
Indeed the punishment of their Lord is not that from which one is safe
And those who guard their private parts
Except from their wives or those their right hands possess for indeed they are not to be blamed
But whoever seeks beyond that then they are the transgressors
And those who are to their trusts and promises attentive
And those who are in their testimonies upright
And those who carefully maintain their prayer
They will be in gardens honored
So what is the matter with those who disbelieve hastening from before you O Muhammad
To sit on your right and your left in separate groups
Does every person among them aspire to enter a garden of pleasure
No Indeed We have created them from that which they know
So I swear by the Lord of all risings and settings that indeed We are able
To replace them with better than them and We are not to be outdone
So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their Day which they are promised
The Day they will emerge from the graves rapidly as if they were toward an erected idol hastening
Their eyes humbled humiliation will cover them
That is the Day which they had been promised
Indeed We sent Noah to his people saying Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment
He said O my people indeed I am to you a clear warner
Saying Worship Allah fear Him and obey me
Allah will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term
Indeed the time set by Allah when it comes will not be delayed if you only knew
He said My Lord indeed I invited my people to truth night and day
But my invitation increased them not except in flight
And indeed every time I invited them that You may forgive them they put their fingers in their ears covered themselves with their garments persisted and were arrogant with great arrogance
Then I invited them publicly
Then I announced to them and also confided to them secretly
And said Ask forgiveness of your Lord
Indeed He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver
He will send rain from the sky upon you in continuing showers
And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers
What is the matter with you that you do not attribute to Allah due grandeur
While He has created you in stages
Do you not consider how Allah has created seven heavens in layers
And made the moon therein a reflected light and made the sun a burning lamp
And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a progressive growth
Then He will return you into it and extract you another extraction
And Allah has made for you the earth an expanse
That you may follow therein roads of passage
Noah said My Lord indeed they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him except in loss
And they conspired an immense conspiracy
And said Never leave your gods and never leave Wadd or Suwa or Yaghuth and Ya uq and Nasr
And already they have misled many
And my Lord do not increase the wrongdoers except in error
Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire and they found not for themselves besides Allah any helpers
And Noah said My Lord do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant
Indeed if You leave them they will mislead Your servants and not beget except every wicked one and confirmed disbeliever
My Lord forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women
And do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction
Say O Muhammad It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said Indeed we have heard an amazing Qur an
It guides to the right course and we have believed in it
And we will never associate with our Lord anyone
And it teaches that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord He has not taken a wife or a son
And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression
And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie
And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn so they only increased them in burden
And they had thought as you thought that Allah would never send anyone as a messenger
And we have sought to reach the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames
And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him
And we do not know therefore whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course
And among us are the righteous and among us are others not so we were of divided ways
And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to Allah upon earth nor can we escape Him by flight
And when we heard the guidance we believed in it
And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden
And among us are Muslims in submission to Allah and among us are the unjust
And whoever has become Muslim those have sought out the right course
But as for the unjust they will be for Hell firewood
And Allah revealed that if they had remained straight on the way We would have given them abundant provision
So We might test them therein
And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord He will put into arduous punishment
And He revealed that the masjids are for Allah so do not invoke with Allah anyone
And that when the Servant of Allah stood up supplicating Him they almost became about him a compacted mass
Say O Muhammad I only invoke my Lord and do not associate with Him anyone
Say Indeed I do not possess for you the power of harm or right direction
Say Indeed there will never protect me from Allah anyone if I should disobey nor will I find in other than Him a refuge
But I have for you only notification from Allah and His messages
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger then indeed for him is the fire of Hell they will abide therein forever
The disbelievers continue until when they see that which they are promised then they will know who is weaker in helpers and less in number
Say I do not know if what you are promised is near or if my Lord will grant for it a long period
He is Knower of the unseen and He does not disclose His knowledge of the unseen to anyone
Except whom He has approved of messengers and indeed He sends before each messenger and behind him observers
That he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord and He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number
O you who wraps himself in clothing
Arise to pray the night except for a little
Half of it or subtract from it a little
Or add to it and recite the Qur an with measured recitation
Indeed We will cast upon you a heavy word
Indeed the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence of heart and tongue and more suitable for words
Indeed for you by day is prolonged occupation
And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with complete devotion
He is the Lord of the East and the West there is no deity except Him so take Him as Disposer of your affairs
And be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance
And leave Me with the matter of the deniers those of ease in life and allow them respite a little
Indeed with Us for them are shackles and burning fire
And food that chokes and a painful punishment
On the Day the earth and the mountains will convulse and the mountains will become a heap of sand pouring down
Indeed We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness upon you just as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger
But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger so We seized him with a ruinous seizure
Then how can you fear if you disbelieve a Day that will make the children white haired
The heaven will break apart therefrom ever is His promise fulfilled
Indeed this is a reminder so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way
Indeed your Lord knows O Muhammad that you stand in prayer almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it and so do a group of those with you
And Allah determines the extent of the night and the day
He has known that you Muslims will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness so recite what is easy for you of the Qur an
He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking something of the bounty of Allah and others fighting for the cause of Allah
So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan Allah a goodly loan
And whatever good you put forward for yourselves you will find it with Allah It is better and greater in reward
And seek forgiveness of Allah
Indeed Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
O you who covers himself with a garment
Arise and warn
And your Lord glorify
And your clothing purify
And uncleanliness avoid
And do not confer favor to acquire more
But for your Lord be patient
And when the trumpet is blown
That Day will be a difficult day
For the disbelievers not easy
Leave Me with the one I created alone
And to whom I granted extensive wealth
And children present with him
And spread everything before him easing his life
Then he desires that I should add more
No
Indeed he has been toward Our verses obstinate
I will cover him with arduous torment
Indeed he thought and deliberated
So may he be destroyed for how he deliberated
Then may he be destroyed for how he deliberated
Then he considered again
Then he frowned and scowled
Then he turned back and was arrogant
And said This is not but magic imitated from others
This is not but the word of a human being
I will drive him into Saqar
And what can make you know what is Saqar
It lets nothing remain and leaves nothing unburned
Blackening the skins
Over it are nineteen angels
And We have not made the keepers of the Fire except angels
And We have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve that those who were given the Scripture will be convinced and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the Scripture and the believers will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is hypocrisy and the disbelievers will say What does Allah intend by this as an example
Thus does Allah leave astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills
And none knows the soldiers of your Lord except Him
And mention of the Fire is not but a reminder to humanity
No
By the moon
And by the night when it departs
And by the morning when it brightens
Indeed the Fire is of the greatest afflictions
As a warning to humanity
To whoever wills among you to proceed or stay behind
Every soul for what it has earned will be retained
Except the companions of the right
Who will be in gardens questioning each other
About the criminals
And asking them What put you into Saqar
They will say We were not of those who prayed
Nor did we used to feed the poor
And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who engaged in it
And we used to deny the Day of Recompense
Until there came to us the certainty
So there will not benefit them the intercession of any intercessors
Then what is the matter with them that they are from the reminder turning away
As if they were alarmed donkeys
Fleeing from a lion
Rather every person among them desires that he would be given scriptures spread about
No But they do not fear the Hereafter
No Indeed the Qur an is a reminder
Then whoever wills will remember it
And they will not remember except that Allah wills
He is worthy of fear and adequate for granting forgiveness
I swear by the Day of Resurrection
And I swear by the reproaching soul to the certainty of resurrection
Does man think that We will not assemble his bones
Yes We are Able even to proportion his fingertips
But man desires to continue in sin
He asks When is the Day of Resurrection
So when vision is dazzled
And the moon darkens
And the sun and the moon are joined
Man will say on that Day Where is the place of escape
No There is no refuge
To your Lord that Day is the place of permanence
Man will be informed that Day of what he sent ahead and kept back
Rather man against himself will be a witness
Even if he presents his excuses
Move not your tongue with it O Muhammad to hasten with recitation of the Qur an
Indeed upon Us is its collection in your heart and to make possible its recitation
So when We have recited it through Gabriel then follow its recitation
Then upon Us is its clarification to you
No
But you love the immediate
And leave the Hereafter
Some faces that Day will be radiant
Looking at their Lord
And some faces that Day will be contorted
Expecting that there will be done to them something backbreaking
No When the soul has reached the collar bones
And it is said Who will cure him
And the dying one is certain that it is the time of separation
And the leg is wound about the leg
To your Lord that Day will be the procession
And the disbeliever had not believed nor had he prayed
But instead he denied and turned away
And then he went to his people swaggering in pride
Woe to you and woe
Then woe to you and woe
Does man think that he will be left neglected
Had he not been a sperm from semen emitted
Then he was a clinging clot and Allah created his form and proportioned him
And made of him two mates the male and the female
Is not that Creator Able to give life to the dead
Has there not come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing even mentioned
Indeed We created man from a spermdrop mixture that We may try him and We made him hearing and seeing
Indeed We guided him to the way be he grateful or be he ungrateful
Indeed We have prepared for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a blaze
Indeed the righteous will drink from a cup of wine whose mixture is of Kafur
A spring of which the righteous servants of Allah will drink they will make it gush forth in force and abundance
They are those who fulfill their vows and fear a Day whose evil will be widespread
And they give food in spite of love for it to the needy the orphan and the captive
Saying We feed you only for the countenance of Allah
We wish not from you reward or gratitude
Indeed We fear from our Lord a Day austere and distressful
So Allah will protect them from the evil of that Day and give them radiance and happiness
And will reward them for what they patiently endured with a garden in Paradise and silk garments
They will be reclining therein on adorned couches They will not see therein any burning sun or freezing cold
And near above them are its shades and its fruit to be picked will be lowered in compliance
And there will be circulated among them vessels of silver and cups having been created clear as glass
Clear glasses made from silver of which they have determined the measure
And they will be given to drink a cup of wine whose mixture is of ginger
From a fountain within Paradise named Salsabeel
There will circulate among them young boys made eternal
When you see them you would think them as beautiful as scattered pearls
And when you look there in Paradise you will see pleasure and great dominion
Upon the inhabitants will be green garments of fine silk and brocade And they will be adorned with bracelets of silver and their Lord will give them a purifying drink
And it will be said Indeed this is for you a reward and your effort has been appreciated
Indeed it is We who have sent down to you O Muhammad the Qur an progressively
So be patient for the decision of your Lord and do not obey from among them a sinner or ungrateful disbeliever
And mention the name of your Lord in prayer morning and evening
And during the night prostrate to Him and exalt Him a long part of the night
Indeed these disbelievers love the immediate and leave behind them a grave Day
We have created them and strengthened their forms and when We will We can change their likenesses with complete alteration
Indeed this is a reminder so he who wills may take to his Lord a way
And you do not will except that Allah wills
Indeed Allah is ever Knowing and Wise
He admits whom He wills into His mercy but the wrongdoers He has prepared for them a painful punishment
By those winds sent forth in gusts
And the winds that blow violently
And by the winds that spread clouds
And those angels who bring criterion
And those angels who deliver a message
As justification or warning
Indeed what you are promised is to occur
So when the stars are obliterated
And when the heaven is opened
And when the mountains are blown away
And when the messengers time has come
For what Day was it postponed
For the Day of Judgement
And what can make you know what is the Day of Judgement
Woe that Day to the deniers
Did We not destroy the former peoples
Then We will follow them with the later ones
Thus do We deal with the criminals
Woe that Day to the deniers
Did We not create you from a liquid disdained
And We placed it in a firm lodging
For a known extent
And We determined it and excellent are We to determine
Woe that Day to the deniers
Have We not made the earth a container
Of the living and the dead
And We placed therein lofty firmly set mountains and have given you to drink sweet water
Woe that Day to the deniers
They will be told Proceed to that which you used to deny
Proceed to a shadow of smoke having three columns
But having no cool shade and availing not against the flame
Indeed it throws sparks as huge as a fortress
As if they were yellowish black camels
Woe that Day to the deniers
This is a Day they will not speak
Nor will it be permitted for them to make an excuse
Woe that Day to the deniers
This is the Day of Judgement We will have assembled you and the former peoples
So if you have a plan then plan against Me
Woe that Day to the deniers
Indeed the righteous will be among shades and springs
And fruits from whatever they desire
Being told Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do
Indeed We thus reward the doers of good
Woe that Day to the deniers
O disbelievers eat and enjoy yourselves a little indeed you are criminals
Woe that Day to the deniers
And when it is said to them Bow in prayer they do not bow
Woe that Day to the deniers
Then in what statement after the Qur an will they believe
About what are they asking one another
About the great news
That over which they are in disagreement
No They are going to know
Then no They are going to know
Have We not made the earth a resting place
And the mountains as stakes
And We created you in pairs
And made your sleep a means for rest
And made the night as clothing
And made the day for livelihood
And constructed above you seven strong heavens
And made therein a burning lamp
And sent down from the rain clouds pouring water
That We may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation
And gardens of entwined growth
Indeed the Day of Judgement is an appointed time
The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes
And the heaven is opened and will become gateways
And the mountains are removed and will be but a mirage
Indeed Hell has been lying in wait
For the transgressors a place of return
In which they will remain for ages unending
They will not taste therein any coolness or drink
Except scalding water and foul purulence
An appropriate recompense
Indeed they were not expecting an account
And denied Our verses with emphatic denial
But all things We have enumerated in writing
So taste the penalty and never will We increase you except in torment
Indeed for the righteous is attainment
Gardens and grapevines
And fullbreasted companions of equal age
And a full cup
No ill speech will they hear therein or any falsehood
As reward from your Lord a generous gift made due by account
From the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them the Most Merciful
They possess not from Him authority for speech
The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows they will not speak except for one whom the Most Merciful permits and he will say what is correct
That is the True Day so he who wills may take to his Lord a way of return
Indeed We have warned you of a near punishment on the Day when a man will observe what his hands have put forth and the disbeliever will say Oh I wish that I were dust
By those angels who extract with violence
And by those who remove with ease
And by those who glide as if swimming
And those who race each other in a race
And those who arrange each matter
On the Day the blast of the Horn will convulse creation
There will follow it the subsequent one
Hearts that Day will tremble
Their eyes humbled
They are presently saying Will we indeed be returned to our former state of life
Even if we should be decayed bones
They say That then would be a losing return
Indeed it will be but one shout
And suddenly they will be alert upon the earth s surface
Has there reached you the story of Moses
When his Lord called to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa
Go to Pharaoh
Indeed he has transgressed
And say to him Would you be willing to purify yourself
And let me guide you to your Lord so you would fear Him
And he showed him the greatest sign
But Pharaoh denied and disobeyed
Then he turned his back striving
And he gathered his people and called out
And said I am your most exalted lord
So Allah seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and the first transgression
Indeed in that is a warning for whoever would fear Allah
Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven Allah constructed it
He raised its ceiling and proportioned it
And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness
And after that He spread the earth
He extracted from it its water and its pasture
And the mountains He set firmly
As provision for you and your grazing livestock
But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity
The Day when man will remember that for which he strove
And Hellfire will be exposed for all those who see
So as for he who transgressed
And preferred the life of the world
Then indeed Hellfire will be his refuge
But as for he who feared the position of his Lord and prevented the soul from unlawful inclination
Then indeed Paradise will be his refuge
They ask you O Muhammad about the Hour when is its arrival
In what position are you that you should mention it
To your Lord is its finality
You are only a warner for those who fear it
It will be on the Day they see it as though they had not remained in the world except for an afternoon or a morning thereof
The Prophet frowned and turned away
Because there came to him the blind man interrupting
But what would make you perceive O Muhammad that perhaps he might be purified
Or be reminded and the remembrance would benefit him
As for he who thinks himself without need
To him you give attention
And not upon you is any blame if he will not be purified
But as for he who came to you striving for knowledge
While he fears Allah
From him you are distracted
No
Indeed these verses are a reminder
So whoever wills may remember it
It is recorded in honored sheets
Exalted and purified
Carried by the hands of messengerangels
Noble and dutiful
Cursed is man how disbelieving is he
From what substance did He create him
From a spermdrop He created him and destined for him
Then He eased the way for him
Then He causes his death and provides a grave for him
Then when He wills He will resurrect him
No Man has not yet accomplished what He commanded him
Then let mankind look at his food
How We poured down water in torrents
Then We broke open the earth splitting it with sprouts
And caused to grow within it grain
And grapes and herbage
And olive and palm trees
And gardens of dense shrubbery
And fruit and grass
As enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock
But when there comes the Deafening Blast
On the Day a man will flee from his brother
And his mother and his father
And his wife and his children
For every man that Day will be a matter adequate for him
Some faces that Day will be bright
Laughing rejoicing at good news
And other faces that Day will have upon them dust
Blackness will cover them
Those are the disbelievers the wicked ones
When the sun is wrapped up in darkness
And when the stars fall dispersing
And when the mountains are removed
And when fullterm shecamels are neglected
And when the wild beasts are gathered
And when the seas are filled with flame
And when the souls are paired
And when the girl who was buried alive is asked
For what sin she was killed
And when the pages are made public
And when the sky is stripped away
And when Hellfire is set ablaze
And when Paradise is brought near
A soul will then know what it has brought with it
So I swear by the retreating stars
Those that run their courses and disappear
And by the night as it closes in
And by the dawn when it breathes
That indeed the Qur an is a word conveyed by a noble messenger
Who is possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne secure in position
Obeyed there in the heavens and trustworthy
And your companion is not at all mad
And he has already seen Gabriel in the clear horizon
And Muhammad is not a withholder of knowledge of the unseen
And the Qur an is not the word of a devil expelled from the heavens
So where are you going
It is not except a reminder to the worlds
For whoever wills among you to take a right course
And you do not will except that Allah wills Lord of the worlds
When the sky breaks apart
And when the stars fall scattering
And when the seas are erupted
And when the contents of graves are scattered
A soul will then know what it has put forth and kept back
O mankind what has deceived you concerning your Lord the Generous
Who created you proportioned you and balanced you
In whatever form He willed has He assembled you
No But you deny the Recompense
And indeed appointed over you are keepers
Noble and recording
They know whatever you do
Indeed the righteous will be in pleasure
And indeed the wicked will be in Hellfire
They will enter to burn therein on the Day of Recompense
And never therefrom will they be absent
And what can make you know what is the Day of Recompense
Then what can make you know what is the Day of Recompense
It is the Day when a soul will not possess for another soul power to do a thing and the command that Day is entirely with Allah
Woe to those who give less than due
Who when they take a measure from people take in full
But if they give by measure or by weight to them they cause loss
Do they not think that they will be resurrected
For a tremendous Day
The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds
No
Indeed the record of the wicked is in sijjeen
And what can make you know what is sijjeen
It is their destination recorded in a register inscribed
Woe that Day to the deniers
Who deny the Day of Recompense
And none deny it except every sinful transgressor
When Our verses are recited to him he says Legends of the former peoples
No
Rather the stain has covered their hearts of that which they were earning
No Indeed from their Lord that Day they will be partitioned
Then indeed they will enter and burn in Hellfire
Then it will be said to them This is what you used to deny
No
Indeed the record of the righteous is in illiyyun
And what can make you know what is illiyyun
It is their destination recorded in a register inscribed
Which is witnessed by those brought near to Allah
Indeed the righteous will be in pleasure
On adorned couches observing
You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure
They will be given to drink pure wine which was sealed
The last of it is musk
So for this let the competitors compete
And its mixture is of Tasneem
A spring from which those near to Allah drink
Indeed those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed
And when they passed by them they would exchange derisive glances
And when they returned to their people they would return jesting
And when they saw them they would say Indeed those are truly lost
But they had not been sent as guardians over them
So Today those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers
On adorned couches observing
Have the disbelievers not been rewarded this Day for what they used to do
When the sky has split open
And has responded to its Lord and was obligated to do so
And when the earth has been extended
And has cast out that within it and relinquished it
And has responded to its Lord and was obligated to do so
O mankind indeed you are laboring toward your Lord with great exertion and will meet it
Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand
He will be judged with an easy account
And return to his people in happiness
But as for he who is given his record behind his back
He will cry out for destruction
And enter to burn in a Blaze
Indeed he had once been among his people in happiness
Indeed he had thought he would never return to Allah
But yes
Indeed his Lord was ever of him Seeing
So I swear by the twilight glow
And by the night and what it envelops
And by the moon when it becomes full
That you will surely experience state after state
So what is the matter with them that they do not believe
And when the Qur an is recited to them they do not prostrate to Allah
But those who have disbelieved deny
And Allah is most knowing of what they keep within themselves
So give them tidings of a painful punishment
Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds
For them is a reward uninterrupted
By the sky containing great stars
And by the promised Day
And by the witness and what is witnessed
Cursed were the companions of the trench
Containing the fire full of fuel
When they were sitting near it
And they to what they were doing against the believers were witnesses
And they resented them not except because they believed in Allah the Exalted in Might the Praiseworthy
To whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
And Allah over all things is Witness
Indeed those who have tortured the believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have the punishment of Hell and they will have the punishment of the Burning Fire
Indeed those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow
That is the great attainment
Indeed the vengeance of your Lord is severe
Indeed it is He who originates creation and repeats
And He is the Forgiving the Affectionate
Honorable Owner of the Throne
Effecter of what He intends
Has there reached you the story of the soldiers
Those of Pharaoh and Thamud
But they who disbelieve are in persistent denial
While Allah encompasses them from behind
But this is an honored Qur an
Inscribed in a Preserved Slate
By the sky and the night comer
And what can make you know what is the night comer
It is the piercing star
There is no soul but that it has over it a protector
So let man observe from what he was created
He was created from a fluid ejected
Emerging from between the backbone and the ribs
Indeed Allah to return him to life is Able
The Day when secrets will be put on trial
Then man will have no power or any helper
By the sky which returns rain
And by the earth which cracks open
Indeed the Qur an is a decisive statement
And it is not amusement
Indeed they are planning a plan
But I am planning a plan
So allow time for the disbelievers
Leave them awhile
Exalt the name of your Lord the Most High
Who created and proportioned
And who destined and then guided
And who brings out the pasture
And then makes it black stubble
We will make you recite O Muhammad and you will not forget
Except what Allah should will
Indeed He knows what is declared and what is hidden
And We will ease you toward ease
So remind if the reminder should benefit
He who fears Allah will be reminded
But the wretched one will avoid it
He who will enter and burn in the greatest Fire
Neither dying therein nor living
He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself
And mentions the name of his Lord and prays
But you prefer the worldly life
While the Hereafter is better and more enduring
Indeed this is in the former scriptures
The scriptures of Abraham and Moses
Has there reached you the report of the Overwhelming event
Some faces that Day will be humbled
Working hard and exhausted
They will enter to burn in an intensely hot Fire
They will be given drink from a boiling spring
For them there will be no food except from a poisonous thorny plant
Which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger
Other faces that Day will show pleasure
With their effort they are satisfied
In an elevated garden
Wherein they will hear no unsuitable speech
Within it is a flowing spring
Within it are couches raised high
And cups put in place
And cushions lined up
And carpets spread around
Then do they not look at the camels how they are created
And at the sky how it is raised
And at the mountains how they are erected
And at the earth how it is spread out
So remind O Muhammad you are only a reminder
You are not over them a controller
However he who turns away and disbelieves
Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment
Indeed to Us is their return
Then indeed upon Us is their account
By the dawn
And by ten nights
And by the even number and the odd
And by the night when it passes
Is there not in all that an oath sufficient for one of perception
Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with Aad
With Iram who had lofty pillars
The likes of whom had never been created in the land
And with Thamud who carved out the rocks in the valley
And with Pharaoh owner of the stakes
All of whom oppressed within the lands
And increased therein the corruption
So your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment
Indeed your Lord is in observation
And as for man when his Lord tries him and thus is generous to him and favors him he says My Lord has honored me
But when He tries him and restricts his provision he says My Lord has humiliated me
No
But you do not honor the orphan
And you do not encourage one another to feed the poor
And you consume inheritance devouring it altogether
And you love wealth with immense love
No
When the earth has been leveled pounded and crushed
And your Lord has come and the angels rank upon rank
And brought within view that Day is Hell that Day man will remember but what good to him will be the remembrance
He will say Oh I wish I had sent ahead some good for my life
So on that Day none will punish as severely as His punishment
And none will bind as severely as His binding of the evildoers
To the righteous it will be said O reassured soul
Return to your Lord wellpleased and pleasing to Him
And enter among My righteous servants
And enter My Paradise
I swear by this city Makkah
And you O Muhammad are free of restriction in this city
And by the father and that which was born of him
We have certainly created man into hardship
Does he think that never will anyone overcome him
He says I have spent wealth in abundance
Does he think that no one has seen him
Have We not made for him two eyes
And a tongue and two lips
And have shown him the two ways
But he has not broken through the difficult pass
And what can make you know what is breaking through the difficult pass
It is the freeing of a slave
Or feeding on a day of severe hunger
An orphan of near relationship
Or a needy person in misery
And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion
Those are the companions of the right
But they who disbelieved in Our signs those are the companions of the left
Over them will be fire closed in
By the sun and its brightness
And by the moon when it follows it
And by the day when it displays it
And by the night when it covers it
And by the sky and He who constructed it
And by the earth and He who spread it
And by the soul and He who proportioned it
And inspired it with discernment of its wickedness and its righteousness
He has succeeded who purifies it
And he has failed who instills it with corruption
Thamud denied their prophet by reason of their transgression
When the most wretched of them was sent forth
And the messenger of Allah Salih said to them Do not harm the shecamel of Allah or prevent her from her drink
But they denied him and hamstrung her
So their Lord brought down upon them destruction for their sin and made it equal upon all of them
And He does not fear the consequence thereof
By the night when it covers
And by the day when it appears
And by He who created the male and female
Indeed your efforts are diverse
As for he who gives and fears Allah
And believes in the best reward
We will ease him toward ease
But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need
And denies the best reward
We will ease him toward difficulty
And what will his wealth avail him when he falls
Indeed incumbent upon Us is guidance
And indeed to Us belongs the Hereafter and the first life
So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing
None will enter to burn therein except the most wretched one
Who had denied and turned away
But the righteous one will avoid it
He who gives from his wealth to purify himself
And not giving for anyone who has done him a favor to be rewarded
But only seeking the countenance of his Lord Most High
And he is going to be satisfied
By the morning brightness
And by the night when it covers with darkness
Your Lord has not taken leave of you O Muhammad nor has He detested you
And the Hereafter is better for you than the first life
And your Lord is going to give you and you will be satisfied
Did He not find you an orphan and give you refuge
And He found you lost and guided you
And He found you poor and made you selfsufficient
So as for the orphan do not oppress him
And as for the petitioner do not repel him
But as for the favor of your Lord report it
Did We not expand for you O Muhammad your breast
And We removed from you your burden
Which had weighed upon your back
And raised high for you your repute
For indeed with hardship will be ease
Indeed with hardship will be ease
So when you have finished your duties then stand up for worship
And to your Lord direct your longing
By the fig and the olive
And by Mount Sinai
And by this secure city Makkah
We have certainly created man in the best of stature
Then We return him to the lowest of the low
Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds for they will have a reward uninterrupted
So what yet causes you to deny the Recompense
Is not Allah the most just of judges
Recite in the name of your Lord who created
Created man from a clinging substance
Recite and your Lord is the most Generous
Who taught by the pen
Taught man that which he knew not
No But indeed man transgresses
Because he sees himself selfsufficient
Indeed to your Lord is the return
Have you seen the one who forbids
A servant when he prays
Have you seen if he is upon guidance
Or enjoins righteousness
Have you seen if he denies and turns away
Does he not know that Allah sees
No
If he does not desist We will surely drag him by the forelock
A lying sinning forelock
Then let him call his associates
We will call the angels of Hell
No
Do not obey him
But prostrate and draw near to Allah
Indeed We sent the Qur an down during the Night of Decree
And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree
The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months
The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter
Peace it is until the emergence of dawn
Those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted from misbelief until there came to them clear evidence
A Messenger from Allah reciting purified scriptures
Within which are correct writings
Nor did those who were given the Scripture become divided until after there had come to them clear evidence
And they were not commanded except to worship Allah being sincere to Him in religion inclining to truth and to establish prayer and to give zakah
And that is the correct religion
Indeed they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell abiding eternally therein
Those are the worst of creatures
Indeed they who have believed and done righteous deeds those are the best of creatures
Their reward with Allah will be gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever Allah being pleased with them and they with Him
That is for whoever has feared his Lord
When the earth is shaken with its final earthquake
And the earth discharges its burdens
And man says What is wrong with it
That Day it will report its news
Because your Lord has commanded it
That Day the people will depart separated into categories to be shown the result of their deeds
So whoever does an atom s weight of good will see it
And whoever does an atom s weight of evil will see it
By the racers panting
And the producers of sparks when striking
And the chargers at dawn
Stirring up thereby clouds of dust
Arriving thereby in the center collectively
Indeed mankind to his Lord is ungrateful
And indeed he is to that a witness
And indeed he is in love of wealth intense
But does he not know that when the contents of the graves are scattered
And that within the breasts is obtained
Indeed their Lord with them that Day is fully Acquainted
The Striking Calamity
What is the Striking Calamity
And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity
It is the Day when people will be like moths dispersed
And the mountains will be like wool fluffed up
Then as for one whose scales are heavy with good deeds
He will be in a pleasant life
But as for one whose scales are light
His refuge will be an abyss
And what can make you know what that is
It is a Fire intensely hot
Competition in worldly increase diverts you
Until you visit the graveyards
No
You are going to know
Then no
You are going to know
No If you only knew with knowledge of certainty
You will surely see the Hellfire
Then you will surely see it with the eye of certainty
Then you will surely be asked that Day about pleasure
By time
Indeed mankind is in loss
Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience
Woe to every scorner and mocker
Who collects wealth and continuously counts it
He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
No
He will surely be thrown into the Crusher
And what can make you know what is the Crusher
It is the fire of Allah eternally fueled
Which mounts directed at the hearts
Indeed Hellfire will be closed down upon them
In extended columns
Have you not considered O Muhammad how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant
Did He not make their plan into misguidance
And He sent against them birds in flocks
Striking them with stones of hard clay
And He made them like eaten straw
For the accustomed security of the Quraysh
Their accustomed security in the caravan of winter and summer
Let them worship the Lord of this House
Who has fed them saving them from hunger and made them safe saving them from fear
Have you seen the one who denies the Recompense
For that is the one who drives away the orphan
And does not encourage the feeding of the poor
So woe to those who pray
But who are heedless of their prayer
Those who make show of their deeds
And withhold simple assistance
Indeed We have granted you O Muhammad alKawthar
So pray to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone
Indeed your enemy is the one cut off
Say O disbelievers
I do not worship what you worship
Nor are you worshippers of what I worship
Nor will I be a worshipper of what you worship
Nor will you be worshippers of what I worship
For you is your religion and for me is my religion
When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest
And you see the people entering into the religion of Allah in multitudes
Then exalt Him with praise of your Lord and ask forgiveness of Him
Indeed He is ever Accepting of repentance
May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined and ruined is he
His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained
He will enter to burn in a Fire of blazing flame
And his wife as well the carrier of firewood
Around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber
Say He is Allah who is One
Allah the Eternal Refuge
He neither begets nor is born
Nor is there to Him any equivalent
Say I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak
From the evil of that which He created
And from the evil of darkness when it settles
And from the evil of the blowers in knots
And from the evil of an envier when he envies
Say I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind
The Sovereign of mankind
The God of mankind
From the evil of the retreating whisperer
Who whispers evil into the breasts of mankind
From among the jinn and mankind
All praise belongs to God Lord of the Universe
the Beneficent the Merciful
and Master of the Day of Judgment
Lord You alone We do worship and from You alone we do seek assistance
Lord guide us to the right path
the path of those to whom You have granted blessings those who are neither subject to Your anger nor have gone astray
Alif Lam
There is no doubt that this book is a guide for the pious
the pious who believe in the unseen attend to prayer give in charity part of what We have granted them
who have faith in what has been revealed to you and others before you and have strong faith in the life hereafter
It is the pious who follow the guidance of their Lord and gain lasting happiness
Those who deny your message will not believe whether you warn them or not
God has sealed their hearts and hearing and their vision is veiled a great punishment awaits them
Some people say We believe in God and the Day of Judgment but they are not true believers
They deceive God and the believers However they have deceived no one but themselves a fact of which they are not aware
A sickness exists in their hearts to which God adds more sickness
Besides this they will suffer a painful punishment as a result of the lie which they speak
When they are told not to commit corruption in the land they reply We are only reformers
They certainly are corrupt but do not realize it
When they are told to believe as everyone else does they say Should we believe as fools do
In fact they themselves are fools but they do not know it
To the believers they declare belief and in secret to their own devils they say We were only mocking
God mocks them and gives them time to continue blindly in their transgressions
They have traded guidance for error but their bargain has had no profit and they have missed the true guidance
Their case is like that of one who kindles a fire and when it grows bright God takes away its light leaving him in darkness wherein he cannot see anything
They are deaf blind and dumb and cannot regain their senses
Or it is like that of a rain storm with darkness thunder and lightning approaching They cover their ears for fear of thunder and death
God encompasses those who deny His words
The lightning almost takes away their vision
When the lightning brightens their surroundings they walk and when it is dark they stand still
Had God wanted He could have taken away their hearing and their vision
God has power over all things
People worship your Lord who created you and those who lived before you so that you may become pious
Worship God who has rendered the earth as a floor for you and the sky as a dome for you and has sent water down from the sky to produce fruits for your sustenance
Do not knowingly set up anything as an equal to God
Should you have any doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant present one chapter comparable to it and call all your supporters besides God if your claim is true
If you do not produce such a chapter and you never will then guard yourselves against the fire whose fuel will be people and stones and is prepared for those who hide the Truth
Muhammad tell the righteously striving believers of the happy news that for them there are gardens wherein streams flow
Whenever they get any fruit from the gardens as food they will say This is just what we had before we came here
These fruits are produced very much like them those we had before
They will have purified spouses and it is they who will live forever
God does not hesitate to set forth parables of anything even a gnat
The believers know that it is the truth from their Lord but those who deny the truth say What does God mean by such parables
In fact by such parables God misleads and guides many
However He only misleads the evil doers
who break their established covenant with Him and the relations He has commanded to be kept and who spread evil in the land
These are the ones who lose a great deal
How dare you deny the existence of God Who gave you life when you initially had no life
He will cause you to die and bring you to life again Then you will return to His Presence
It is He who created everything on earth for you Then directing His order towards the realm above He turned it into seven heavens
He has knowledge of all things
When your Lord said to the angels I am appointing someone as my deputy on earth they said almost protesting Are you going to appoint one who will commit corruption and bloodshed therein even though we are the ones who commemorate Your Name and glorify You
The Lord said I know that which you do not know
He taught Adam all the names Then He introduced some intelligent beings to the angels asking them to tell Him the names of these beings if the angels were true to their claim that they more deserved to be His deputies on earth
The angels replied You are glorious indeed
We do not know more than what You have taught us
You alone are Allknowing and Allwise
The Lord said to Adam Tell the names of the beings to the angels
When Adam said their names the Lord said Did I not tell you angels that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth and all that you reveal or hide
When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam they all obeyed except Iblis Satan who abstained out of pride and so he became one of those who deny the truth
We told Adam to stay with his spouse Eve in the garden and enjoy the foods therein but not to go near a certain tree lest he become one of the transgressors
Satan made Adam and his spouse err and caused them to abandon the state in which they had been living
Then We said Descend you are each other s enemies
The earth will be a dwelling place for you and it will provide you with sustenance for an appointed time
Adam was inspired by some words of prayer through which he received forgiveness from his Lord for He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
We ordered them all to get out of the garden and told them that when Our guidance came to them those who would follow it would have neither fear nor grief
But those who would deny the Truth and reject Our revelations would be the companions of the Fire in which they would live forever
Children of Israel recall My favors which you enjoyed Fulfill your covenant with Me and I shall fulfill Mine
Revere only Me
Believe in My revelations Quran that confirms what I revealed to you about Prophet Muhammad in your Scripture
Do not be the first ones to deny it nor sell My revelations for a small price but have fear of Me
Do not mix truth with falsehood and do not deliberately hide the truth
Be steadfast in prayer pay the religious tax zakat and bow down in worship with those who do the same
Would you order people to do good deeds and forget to do them yourselves even though you read the Book
Why do you not think
Help yourselves in your affairs with patience and prayer
It is a difficult task indeed but not for the humble ones
who are certain of their meeting with their Lord and their return to Him
Children of Israel recall My favors to you and the preference that I gave to you over all nations
Have fear of the day when every soul will be responsible for itself No intercession or ransom will be accepted and no one will receive help
Children of Israel recall My favor of saving you from the Pharaoh s people who afflicted you with the worst kind of cruelty slaying your sons and sparing your women
Your suffering was indeed a great trial from your Lord
We parted the sea to save you and drowned Pharaoh s people before your very eyes
Then We called Moses for an appointment of forty nights
You began to worship the calf in his absence doing wrong to yourselves
Afterwards We forgave you so that you would perhaps appreciate Our favors
We gave Moses the Book and the criteria of discerning right from wrong so that perhaps you would be rightly guided
Moses said to his people My people you have done wrong to yourselves by worshipping the calf
Seek pardon from your Lord and slay yourselves
He told them that it would be best for them in the sight of their Lord Who would forgive them for He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When you argued with Moses saying that you were not going to believe him unless you could see God with your own eyes the swift wind struck you and you could do nothing but watch
Then We brought you back to life in the hope that you might appreciate Our favors
We provided you with shade from the clouds and sent down manna and quails as the best pure sustenance for you to eat
They children of Israel did not wrong Us but wronged themselves
Children of Israel recall My favors when We told you Enter this city enjoy eating whatever you want therein prostrate yourselves and ask forgiveness when passing through the gate and We shall forgive your sins and add to the rewards of the righteous ones
The unjust ones among you changed what they were told to say Then We afflicted them with a torment from the heavens for their evil deeds
When Moses prayed for rain We told him to strike the rock with his staff
Thereupon twelve fountains gushed out of the rock and each tribe knew their drinking place
The Lord told them Eat and drink from God s bounties and do not abuse the earth with corruption
When you demanded Moses to provide you with a variety of food saying We no longer have patience with only one kind of food ask your Lord to grow green herbs cucumbers corn lentils and onions for us Moses replied Would you change what is good for what is worse Go to any town and you will get what you want Despised and afflicted with destitution they brought the wrath of God back upon themselves for they denied the evidence of the existence of God and murdered His Prophets without reason they were disobedient transgressors
However those who have become believers the Muslims and the Jews the Christians and the Sabaeans who believe in God and the Day of Judgment and strive righteously will receive their reward from the Lord and will have nothing to fear nor will they be grieved
Children of Israel recall when We made a covenant with you raised Mount Tur Sinai above you and told you to receive earnestly what We had given to you and bear it in mind so that you would protect yourselves against evil
Again you turned away
Had God s Grace and His Mercy not existed in your favor you would certainly have been lost
You certainly knew about those among you who were transgressors on the Sabbath
We commanded them Become detested apes
in order to set up an example for their contemporaries and coming generations and to make it a reminder for the pious
When Moses said to his people God commands you to sacrifice a cow they asked Are you mocking us
God forbid how would I be so ignorant said Moses
They demanded Ask your Lord to describe the kind of cow He wants us to slaughter
Moses explained It must be neither too old nor too young thus do whatever you are commanded to do
Moses then told them to do as they were ordered
They further demanded Moses to ask the Lord what color the cow has to be
Moses answered The Lord says that the cow must be yellow a beautiful yellow
They said We are confused about the cow for to us all cows look alike
Ask your Lord to tell us exactly what the cow looks like so that God willing we shall have the right description
Moses said The Lord says that it must not have even tilled the soil nor irrigated the fields and it must be free of blemishes and flaws
They said Now you have given us the right description
After almost failing to find it they slaughtered the cow
When you murdered someone each one of you tried to accuse others of being guilty
However God made public what you were hiding
We said Strike the person slain with some part of the cow
That is how God brings the dead to life and shows you His miracles so that you might have understanding
Thereafter your hearts turned as hard as rocks or even harder for some rocks give way to the streams to flow
Water comes out of some rocks when they are torn apart and others tumble down in awe before God
God does not ignore what you do
Do you the believers in truth desire the unbelievers to believe you
There was a group among them who would hear the word of God and understand it Then they would purposely misinterpret it
On meeting the believers they would declare belief but to each other they would say How would you against your own interests tell them believers about what God has revealed to you in the Bible of the truthfulness of the Prophet Muhammad They will present it as evidence to prove you wrong before your Lord
Do you not realize it
Do they not know that God knows whatever they conceal or reveal
Some of them are illiterate and have no knowledge of the Book except for what they know from legends and fantasy
They are only relying on conjecture
Woe to those who write the Book themselves and say This is from God so that they may sell it for a small price
Woe unto them for what they have done and for what they have gained
They have said Hell fire will never harm us except for just a few days Muhammad ask them Have you made such agreements with God Who never breaks any of His agreements or you just ascribe to Him that which you do not know
There is no doubt that evil doers who are engulfed in sins are the companions of hell fire wherein they will live forever
As for the righteously striving believers they will be among the people of Paradise wherein they will live forever
We made a covenant with the children of Israel that they should not worship anyone except Me that they should serve their parents relatives orphans and the destitute that they should speak righteous words to people and that they should be steadfast in their prayers and pay the religious tax
But soon after you made this covenant all but a few of you broke it heedlessly
We made a covenant with you that you should not shed each other s blood or expel each other from your homeland
You accepted and bore witness to this covenant
yet you murdered each other and forced a number of your people out of their homeland helping each other to commit sin and to be hostile to one another
When you had expelled people from their homeland and later they had been made captives of other people you then paid their ransom thinking that it was a righteous deed
God forbade you to expel these people in the first place
Do you believe in one part of the Book and not in the other
Those who behave in this way shall reap disgrace in this world and severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection
God is not unaware of things that you do
They have traded the life hereafter in exchange for their worldly life
Their punishment will not be eased nor will they receive help
We gave the Book to Moses and made the Messengers follow in his path
To Jesus the son of Mary We gave the miracles and supported him by the Holy Spirit
Why do you arrogantly belie some Messengers and murder others whenever they have brought you messages that you dislike
They have said that their hearts cannot understand what you Muhammad say
God has condemned them for their denial of the Truth
There are a very few of them who have faith
When a Book came to them from God which confirms what is with them the fact of truthfulness of the Prophet Muhammad in their Scripture and despite the fact that they had been praying for victory over the disbelievers by the help of the truthful Prophet they refuse to accept this book even though they know it to be the Truth
May God condemn those who hide the Truth
Evil is that for which they have sold their souls They have refused to accept God s revelations in rebellion against the servant of God whom He has by His Grace chosen to grant His message
They have brought upon themselves God s wrath in addition to the wrath that they had incurred upon themselves for their previous sins
The disbelievers will suffer a humiliating torment
When they are told to believe n God s revelations they reply We believe only in what God has revealed to us but they disbelieve His other true revelations even though these revelations confirms their own original Scripture
Muhammad ask them Why did you murder God s Prophets if you were true believers
Moses brought you certain miracles
Not very long after you began worshipping the calf which was nothing but senseless cruelty to yourselves
Children of Israel when We made a covenant with you raised Mount Tur Sinai above you and told you to receive devotedly what We had revealed to you and to listen to it you said that you had listened but you disobeyed
They denied the truth and became totally devoted and full of love for the calf
Muhammad tell these people If in fact you are true believers then what your faith commands you to do is evil
Muhammad tell them If your claim is true that the home with God in the everlasting life hereafter is for you alone you should have a longing for death
But they can never have a longing for death because of what they have done
God knows the unjust well
However you will find them the greediest of all men even more than the pagans for life
They would each gladly live for a thousand years but such a long life would not save them from the torment
God sees what they do
Muhammad tell the people whoever is an enemy to Gabriel who has delivered the Book to your heart as a guide and as joyful news to the believers
and as a confirmation of original Scripture and whoever is the enemy of God His angels His Messenger Gabriel and Michael should know that God is the enemy of those who hide the Truth
Muhammad We have given you enlightening authority Only the wicked sinners deny it
Why is it that every time they the Jews make a covenant some of them abandon it
Most of them do not even believe
When a Messenger of God came to them confirming the original revelation that they already had received a group of those who had the Scripture with them threw the Book of God behind their backs as if they did not know anything about it
They followed the incantations that the devils used against the kingdom of Solomon
Solomon did not hide the truth but the devils did They taught magic to the people and whatever was revealed to the two angels Harut and Marut in Babylon
The two angels did not teach anything to anyone without saying Our case is a temptation for the people so do not hide the truth
People learned something from the two angels that could cause discord between a man and his wife
However they could harm no one except by the permission of God
In fact the people learned things that would harm them and render them no benefit
They knew very well that one who engaged in witchcraft would have no reward in the life hereafter
Would that they had known that they had sold their souls for that which is vile
Would that they had known that if they had embraced the faith and avoided evil they would have received better rewards from God
Believers do not address the Prophet as ra ina whereby the Jews in their own accent meant Would that you would never hear but call him unzurna meaning Please speak to us slowly so that we understand and then listen The unbelievers will face a painful torment
Muhammad the disbelievers among the People of the Book and the pagans do not like to see anything good revealed to you from your Lord
God reserves His mercy for whomever He chooses
The generosity of God is great
For whatever sign We change or eliminate or cause to recede into oblivion We bring forth a better sign one that is identical
Do you not know that God has power over all things
Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to God and that no one is your guardian or helper besides Him
Do you want to address the Prophet in the same manner in which Moses was addressed
Anyone who exchanges belief for disbelief has certainly gone down the wrong path
Once you have accepted the faith many of the People of the Book would love out of envy to turn you back to disbelief even after the Truth has become evident to them
Have forgiveness and bear with them until God issues His order
God has power over all things
Be steadfast in your prayer and pay the religious tax
You will receive a good reward from God for all your good works
God is Wellaware of what you do
They have said that no one can ever go to Paradise except the Jews or Christians but this is only what they hope
Ask them to prove that their claim is true
However one who accepts Islam in submission to God and does good will have his reward with God
Such people will have nothing to fear nor to grieve about
The Jews accuse the Christians of having no basis for their religion and the Christians accuse the Jews of having no basis for their religion even though both sides read the Scripture
The ignorant ones say the same thing
God will issue His decree about their dispute on the Day of Judgment
Who is more unjust than those who strive to destroy the mosques and prevent others from commemorating the Name of God therein who could not enter the mosques except with fear
They the unjust ones will be disgraced in this life and will receive great torment in the life hereafter
The East and the West belong to God Wherever you turn you are always in the presence of God
God is Munificent and Omniscient
They the People of the Book have said that God has taken for Himself a son
He is too glorious to have a son
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth All pray in obedience to Him
God is the Originator of the heavens and the earth
Whenever He decides to do anything He just commands it to exist and it comes into existence
The ignorant have asked Why does He not speak to us and why has no evidence come to show us that He exists
People before them had also asked such questions
They all think in the same way
We have already made the evidence very clear for those who have certainty
We have sent you Muhammad for a genuine purpose to proclaim glad news and warnings
You will not be blamed for the dwellers of blazing hell
The Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you unless you follow their faith
Muhammad tell them that the guidance of God is the only true guidance
If you follow their wishes after all the knowledge that has come to you you will no longer have God as your guardian and helper
Those of the People of the Book who have received Our Book Quran and read it thoroughly believe in it Those who disbelieve the Book are certainly losers
Children of Israel recall My favor to you and the preference that I gave to you over all the other nations
Have fear of the day when every soul will be responsible for itself no ransom will be accepted for it no intercession will be of any benefit to it and no one will receive any help
When his Lord tested Abraham s faith by His words and he satisfied the test He said I am appointing you as the leader of mankind
Abraham asked Will this leadership also continue through my descendants
The Lord replied The unjust do not have the right to exercise My authority
We made the house in Mecca as a place of refuge and sanctuary for men
Adopt the place where Abraham stood as a place for prayer
We advised Abraham and Ishmael to keep My house clean for the pilgrims the worshippers and for those who bow down and prostrate themselves in worship
When Abraham prayed to the Lord saying Lord make this town a place of security and provide those in the town who believe in God and the Day of Judgement with plenty God replied I shall allow those who hide the truth to enjoy themselves for a while
Then I shall drive them into the torment of hell fire a terrible destination
While Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundation of the house they prayed Lord accept our labor
You are Allhearing and Allknowing
Lord make us good Muslims one who submits himself to God and from our descendants make a good Muslim nation
Teach us the rules of worship and accept our repentance You are Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Lord send to them our descendants a Messenger of their own who will recite to them Your revelations teach them the Book give them wisdom and purify them
You alone are the Majestic and the Most Wise
No one turns away from Abraham s Tradition except one who makes a fool of himself
To Abraham We have granted distinction in this world and in the life hereafter he will be among the righteous ones
When God commanded Abraham to submit he replied I have submitted myself to the Will of the Lord of the universe
Abraham left this legacy to his sons and in turn so did Jacob saying God has chosen this religion for you You must not leave this world unless you are a Muslim submitted to the will of the Lord of the Universe
Were you believers there when death approached Jacob
When he asked his sons Whom will you worship after my death
They replied We will worship your Lord the Lord of your fathers Abraham Ishmael and Isaac He is the only Lord and to Him we have submitted ourselves
That nation children of Abraham is gone
They have reaped what they sowed and the same applies to you
You are not responsible for their deeds
The Jews and the Christians have asked the Muslims to accept their faith to have the right guidance
Muhammad tell them We would rather follow the upright religion of Abraham who was not a pagan
Muslims say We believe in God and what He has revealed to us and to Abraham Ishmael Isaac and their descendants and what was revealed to Moses Jesus and the Prophets from their Lord
We make no distinction among them and to God we have submitted ourselves
If they have faith in all that you believe they will have the right guidance but if they turn away it would be for no reason other than their own malice God is a Sufficient defender for you against them He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Say Belief in God and following the guidance of Islam are God s means of purification for us
Islam is the baptism of God
No one is a better baptizer than He and we Muslims worship Him
Muhammad ask the People of the Book Why should you argue with us about God Who is our Lord as well as yours when we are sincere in our belief in God
Everyone will be responsible for his own deeds Do you People of the Book claim that Abraham Ishmael Isaac and their descendants were Jews or Christians
Ask them Who possesses greater knowledge you or God Who is more unjust than one who refuses to testify to the truth that God has given to him
That nation is gone they have reaped what they sowed and the same applies to you
You are not responsible for their deeds
Fools will soon say What has made them Muslims change the direction to which they had been facing during their prayers the qibla
Muhammad tell them Both the East and West belong to God and He guides whomever He wants to the right direction
We have made you true Muslims a moderate nation so that you could be an example for all people and the Prophet an example for you
The direction which you had been facing during your prayers the qibla was only made in order that We would know who would follow the Messenger and who would turn away
It was a hard test but not for those to whom God has given guidance
God did not want to make your previous prayers worthless God is Compassionate and Allmerciful
We certainly saw you Muhammad often turn your face to the sky so We shall instruct you to face a qibla that you will like
Muhammad during prayer turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque in Makkah
Muslims also wherever you are during your prayers turn your faces towards the Sacred Mosque
The People of the Book certainly know that this command to change the qibla is truly from their Lord
God is not unaware of what they do
Even if you were to bring all kinds of authoritative proof to the People of the Book they still would not accept your qibla nor would you accept theirs nor would they accept each others Were you to follow their desires after all the knowledge that has come to you you would certainly have been one of the unjust
Those to whom We have given the Book Bible know you Muhammad just as a well as they know their sons
It is certain that some of them deliberately hide the truth
Never doubt that the essence of truth comes from your Lord
Every one pursues his goal
Compete with each other in performing good deeds
Wherever you are God will bring you all together
God has power over all things
Muhammad wherever you go turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque in Mecca
This is the truth from your Lord who is not unaware of what you do
Muhammad wherever you go turn your face to the Sacred Mosque and Muslims wherever you are turn your faces in the same direction so that no group of people except the unjust among them would have any reason against you and so that I may establish My commandments for your people to have proper guidance The unjust may criticize you but do not fear them fear only Me
As We have sent a Messenger from your own people to show you evidence about Me to purify you from sins to teach you the Book give you wisdom and instruct you in that which you did not know
therefore remember Me and I shall remember you
Thank Me and do not hide the truth about Me
Believers help yourselves in your affairs through patience and prayer God is with those who have patience
Do not consider those who are slain for the cause of God to be dead
They are alive but you are unaware of them
We shall test you through fear hunger loss of life property and crops
Muhammad give glad news to the people who have patience
and in difficulty say We are the servants of God and to Him we shall all return
It is they who will receive blessings and mercy from God and who follow the right guidance
Safa and Marwah names of two places in Mecca are reminders of God
It is no sin for one who visits the Sacred House in Mecca to walk seven times between Safa and Marwah
Whoever willingly does a good deed in obedience to God will find God Allknowing and Fully Appreciative
Those who hide the authoritative proofs and the guidance that We have revealed after it has been made clear for the People of the Book will be condemned by God and those who have the right to condemn
However I shall accept the repentance of those of them who repent for their sins reform their manners and preach the truth I am Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who deny My existence and die with such attitude will be subject to the condemnation of God the angels and all people
They will live condemned forever will have no relief from the torment and no attention will be paid to them
Our Lord is the only Lord There is no God but He the Beneficent and Merciful
The creation of the heavens and the earth the alternation of nights and days the ships that sail in the sea for the benefit of the people the water that God sends from the sky to revive the dead earth where He has scattered all kinds of animals the winds of all directions and the clouds rendered for service between the sky and the earth are all evidence of His existence for those who use their reason
Some people consider certain things equal to God and love them just as one should love God
However the strongest of the believers love is their love of God
Had the unjust been able to reflect about their condition when facing the torment they would have had no doubt that to God belongs Allpower and that He is stern in His retribution
When the leaders see the torment and lose all their resources they will denounce their followers
The followers will say Had we had the chance we also would have denounced our leaders
That is how God will show them their regrettable deeds They will not be able to escape from hell fire
People eat of the good and lawful things on earth
Do not follow the footsteps of Satan he is clearly your enemy
He tries to make you do evil and shameful things and speak against God without knowledge
When some people are asked to follow the revelations of God they say We would rather follow what our fathers have followed even though their fathers had no understanding and could not find the true guidance
Preaching to unbelievers is like talking to someone who cannot hear anything except yells and shouts
They are deaf dumb and blind they have no understanding
Believers eat from the good things that We have given you and give thanks to God if you worship only Him
God has forbidden you to eat that which has not been properly slaughtered blood pork and the flesh of any animal which has not been consecrated with a mention of the Name of God
However in an emergency without the intention of transgression or repeating transgression one will not be considered to have committed a sin
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who receive some small gain by hiding the Books which God has revealed have in fact filled up their stomachs with fire
God will not speak with them on the Day of Judgment nor will He purify them instead they will face a painful torment
They have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for torment
What makes them seek the fire so earnestly for they are doomed to be punished
God has revealed the Book in all Truth and those who dispute it are filled with malice which has taken them far away from the truth
Righteousness is not determined by facing East or West during prayer
Righteousness consists of the belief in God the Day of Judgment the angels the Books of God His Prophets to give money for the love of God to relatives orphans the destitute and those who are on a journey and in urgent need of money beggars to set free slaves and to be steadfast in prayer to pay the religious tax zakat to fulfill one s promises and to exercise patience in poverty in distress and in times of war
Such people who do these are truly righteous and pious
Believers in case of murder the death penalty is the sanctioned retaliation a free man for a free man a slave for a slave and a female for a female
However if the convicted person receives pardon from the aggrieved party the prescribed rules of compensation must be followed accordingly
This is a merciful alteration from your Lord
Whoever transgresses against it will face a painful punishment
People of understanding the law of the death penalty as retaliation grants you life so that perhaps you will have fear of God
If one of you facing death can leave a legacy he should bequeath it to his parents and relatives according to the law
This is the duty of the pious
Whoever intentionally changes the will of a deceased person he has committed a sin
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
One who is afraid of the testator s deviations and sin and settles the matter among the parties involved he has not committed a sin
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers fasting has been made mandatory for you as it was made mandatory for the people before you so that you may have fear of God
Fasting is only for a certain number of days
One who is sick or on a journey has to fast the same number of days at another time
Those who can afford a redemption should feed a poor person
Good deeds performed on one s own initiative will be rewarded However fasting is better and will be rewarded
Would that you knew this
The month of Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed a guide for the people the most authoritative of all guidance and a criteria to discern right from wrong
Anyone of you who knows that the month of Ramadan has begun he must start to fast Those who are sick or on a journey have to fast the same number of days at another time
God does not impose any hardship upon you He wants you to have comfort so that you may complete the fast glorify God for His having given you guidance and that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Muhammad if any of My servants ask you about Me tell them that the Lord says I am near I accept the prayers of those who pray Let My servants answer My call and believe in Me so that perhaps they may know the right direction
It is made lawful for you during the nights of fasting to have carnal relations with your wives
They are your garments and you are their garments
God knew that you were deceiving yourselves He relented towards you and forgave you
Now it is lawful for you to have carnal relations with your wives and follow what God has commanded Eat and drink until the white streak of dawn becomes distinguishable from darkness
Complete your fast starting from dawn to dusk It is not lawful to have carnal relations with your wives during i tikaf in the mosque
Do not come close to transgressing them Thus has God explained His evidence to men so that perhaps they will have fear of God
Do not use your property among yourselves in illegal ways and then deliberately bribe the rulers with your property so that you may wrongly acquire the property of others
Muhammad they ask you about the different phases of the moon Tell them that they are there to indicate to people the phases of time and the pilgrimage season
It is not a righteous act to enter houses from the back
Righteousness is to be pious and enter the houses from the front door
Have fear of God so that perhaps you will have lasting happiness
Fight for the cause of God those who fight you but do not transgress for God does not love the transgressors
Slay them wherever you may catch them and expel them from the place from which they expelled you
The sin of disbelief in God is greater than committing murder
Do not fight them in the vicinity of the Sacred Mosque in Mecca unless they start to fight
Then slay them for it is the recompense that the disbelievers deserve
If they give up disbelief and fighting God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Fight them so that there will be no disbelief in God and God s religion will become dominant If they change their behavior there would be no hostility against anyone except the unjust
It is because of their disrespect of a sacred month that you are also allowed to retaliate against them in a sacred month
If any one transgresses against you you also may retaliate against them to an equal extent
Have fear of God and know that He supports the pious
Give money for the cause of God but do not push yourselves into perdition
Do good God loves the people who do good deeds
Complete the hajj and umrah two parts of the rituals of pilgrimage to Makka in obedience to God If you are prevented from completing the duty of hajj offer whatever sacrifice is possible and do not shave your heads before the sacrificial animal is delivered to the prescribed place
If one of you is ill or is suffering because of some ailment in your head you must redeem the shaving of the head by fasting or paying money or offering a sheep as a sacrifice
When all is well with you and you want to complete the umrah in the hajj season offer whatever sacrifice is possible
If you do not find an animal you have to fast for three days during the days of the pilgrimage rituals and seven days at home to complete the required ten fasting days
This rule is for those who live beyond a distance of twelve miles from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca
Have fear of God and know that He is stern in His retribution
The months of the hajj pilgrimage season are well known
Whoever undertakes to complete the hajj rituals must know that after commencing the acts of Hajj he is not allowed to have carnal relations or to lie or to swear by the Name of God
God knows all your good deeds
Supply yourselves for the journey
The best supply is piety
People of understanding have fear of Me
It is not a sin if you try to make a profit out of the bounty of your Lord by trading during hajj
When you leave Arafah commemorate the name of your Lord in Mash ar the sacred reminder of God
Commemorate His name as He has given you guidance while prior to that you had been in error
Then leave Mash ar as the rest of the people do and ask forgiveness from God He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
After you complete the acts of your Hajj also commemorate God just as you would remember your father or even more earnestly
Some people say Lord give us what we want in this life but in the life hereafter they have no beneficial share
Others pray Lord give us good things both in this life as well as in the life hereafter and save us from the torment of fire
They will have their share of the reward for their deeds
God s reckoning is swift
Commemorate the names of God in the prescribed days
For one who observes piety it is not a sin to be hasty or tardy during the two days
Have fear of God and know that before Him you will all be raised after death
There are some people whose words about this life may please you
They say that God knows what they have in their hearts
But in fact they are the most quarrelsome opponents
As soon as they leave you they quickly commit evil in the land destroying the farms and people
God does not love evil
When they are asked to have fear of God sinful pride prevents them from paying heed to such advice
It is enough for them to have hell as a terrible dwelling place
There are those among people who give their lives to seek God s pleasure
God is Affectionate to His servants
Believers submit yourselves to the will of God as a whole
Do not follow the footsteps of Satan he is your sworn enemy
If you are seduced after you have received the authoritative guidance know that God is Majestic and Wise
Have they decided not to believe until God comes down in a shadow of clouds with the angels so that then the matter is settled
To God do all matters return
Muhammad ask the children of Israel about how many visible miracles We had shown them
God is certainly stern in His retribution to those who change the bounty of God His revelation after having received His guidance
The worldly life is made to seem attractive to the disbelievers who scoff at the faithful but the pious in the life hereafter will have a position far above them
God grants sustenance without account to anyone He wants
At one time all people were only one nation
God sent Prophets with glad news and warnings He sent the Book with them for a genuine purpose to provide the people with the ruling about disputed matters among them
No one disputed this matter except those who had already received evidence before Their dispute was only because of their own hostility
To deal with this dispute God through His will sent guidance to the believers
God guides to the right path whomever He wants
Would you think that you could go to Paradise without experiencing the kind of suffering others have experienced before you
Distress and afflictions battered them until the Messenger and the believers said When will God send help
Certainly God s help is near
They ask you what to spend for the cause of God Muhammad tell them that whatever you spend give it to your parents the orphans the destitute and those who may be in urgent need of money whilst on a journey
Whatever good you do God certainly is Aware of it
Fighting is made mandatory for you but you dislike it
You may not like something which in fact is for your good and something that you may love in fact may be evil
God knows but you do not know
Muhammad they ask you about fighting in the sacred month
Tell them that it is a great sin However creating an obstacle in the way of God disbelief in Him and the Sacred Mosque and driving away the neighbors of the Sacred Mosque is an even greater sin in the sight of God Disbelief in God is worse than committing murder
The pagans still try to fight you to make you give up your religion
The deeds in this life of those of you who give up their religion and who die disbelievers will be made void and in the life hereafter
These people will be the dwellers of Hell wherein they will remain forever
The believers and the Emigrants from Mecca who fight for the cause of God indeed have hope in receiving the mercy of God God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad they ask you about wine and gambling Tell them that there is great sin in them
Although they have benefits for men the sin therein is far greater than the benefit
They ask you about what they should give for the cause of God Tell them Let it be what you can spare
This is how God explains for you His guidance so that perhaps you will think
about this life and the life hereafter
They ask you about the orphans Tell them The best thing to do is what is for their good
They are your brethren if you would associate with them
God knows who is corrupt or a reformer
Had God wanted He would have brought upon you hardship
God is Majestic and Allwise
Do not marry pagan women unless they believe in God
A believing slave girl is better than an idolater even though the idolaters may attract you
Do not marry pagan men unless they believe in God
A believing slave is better than an idolater even though the idolater may attract you
The pagans invite you to the fire but God invites you to Paradise and forgiveness through His will God shows His evidence to people so that they may take heed
They ask you about women s menses Tell them It is an ailment
Avoid having carnal relations with them until their period is over Then you may have carnal relations with them according to the rules of God
God loves those who repent and those who purify themselves
Your wives are as fields for you
You may enter your fields from any place you want
Reserve something good for your souls for the life hereafter
Have fear of God and know that you are going to meet Him
Muhammad give the glad news to the believers
Do not swear by God not to do good things or have piety or make peace among people
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
God will not take into account your inattentive oath However He will question you about what your hearts have gained
God is Allforgiving and Lenient
Those who swear by God not to ever have any carnal relations with their wives will not be punished if they decide to resume marital relations again within four months God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
If they choose divorce God is Allhearing and Allknowing
The divorced women must wait up to three menstrual cycles before another marriage
If they believe in God and the Day of Judgment it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs
Within their waiting period their husbands have the right to resume marital relations if they want reconciliation
Women have benefits as well as responsibilities
Men have a status above women
God is Majestic and Wise
A marital relation can only be resumed after the first and second divorce otherwise it must be continued with fairness or terminated with kindness
It is not lawful for you to take back from women what you have given them unless you are afraid of not being able to observe God s law
In this case it would be no sin for her to pay a ransom to set herself free from the bond of marriage
These are the laws of God
Do not transgress against them those who do so are unjust
After a divorce for the third time it is not lawful for the husband to resume marital relations with her or remarry her until she has been married and divorced by another husband In that case there is no sin for the former husband to marry her if they both think that they can abide by the law
These are the laws of God He explains them for the people of knowledge
When you divorce your wives and their waiting period has almost ended you may resume marital relations with honor or leave them with kindness
Do not force them to live with you in suffering to satisfy your hostility
Whoever commits such transgressions he has only harmed himself
Do not make jest of God s words
Remember the favors that God has done to you and the Book and wisdom He has revealed for your guidance
Have fear of God and know that God has knowledge of all things
When the waiting period of the divorced women has ended you her relatives must not prevent them from marrying their previous husbands again if they might reach an honorable agreement
This is an advice for those of you who believe in God and the Day of Judgment
It is the most beneficial and pure way of treating each other
God knows but you do not know
Mothers will breast feed their babies for two years if the fathers want them to complete this term
The father has to pay them reasonable expenses
No soul is responsible for what is beyond its ability
None of the parents should suffer any loss from the other because of the baby
The heirs are responsible to look after the children of a deceased
It is no sin for the parents to have a mutual agreement about weaning the baby
There is no sin in hiring a woman to breast feed your children for a reasonable payment
Have fear of God and know that God is well aware of what you do
The wives of those of you who die have to wait for a period of four months and ten days
After this appointed time it is no sin for the relatives of the deceased to let the widows do what is reasonable
God knows well what you do
It is not a sin if you make an indirect marriage proposal or have such an intention in your hearts
God knows that you will cherish their memories in your hearts
Do not have secret dates unless you behave lawfully
Do not decide for a marriage before the appointed time is over
Know that God knows what is in your hearts
Have fear of Him and know that He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Also it is not a sin if you divorce your wives before the consummation of the marriage or the fixing of the dowry But the dowry will be due from a husband whether he is rich or poor
It is payable in a reasonable amount according to the husband s financial ability This is an obligation for the righteous ones
If you divorce your wives before the consummation of the marriage and the amount of dowry has been fixed pay your wives half of the amount of their dowry unless she or her guardians drop their demand for payment
To drop such a demand is closer to piety
Be generous to each other
God is WellAware of what you do
Pay due attention to your prayers especially the middle prayer and stand up while praying in obedience to God
In an emergency you may say your prayers while walking or riding but when you are safe remember God as He has taught you what you did not know before
Those who are about to die and leave widows behind should bequeath for their wives the expenses of one year s maintenance The widows must not be expelled from the house for up to one year
It is no sin for the relatives of the deceased to permit the widows to leave the house before the appointed time and do what is reasonable
God is Majestic and Wise
The divorced women have the right to receive reasonable provisions It is an obligation for the pious
Thus does God explain His revelations to you so that perhaps you will have understanding
Muhammad consider the thousands who left their homes for fear of death who were then caused by God to die and brought back to life
God is generous to men but most people are not grateful
Fight for the cause of God and know that God is Allhearing and Allknowing
One who generously lends to God will be paid back in many multiples of the loan
It is God who reduces and expands things and to Him you will all return
Muhammad remember that group of the Israelites after Moses who demanded a Prophet of their own to appoint a king for them who would lead them in the fight for the cause of God
Their Prophet then said What if you are ordered to fight and you disobey
They said Why should we not fight for the cause of God when we and our sons have been expelled from our homes
However when they were ordered to fight all refused except a few among them
God knows well the unjust
Their Prophet said God has appointed Saul as a king for you
They replied How can he dominate us when we deserve more to be king than he Besides he does not have abundant wealth
Their Prophet said God has chosen him as your ruler and has given him physical power and knowledge
God grants His authority to anyone whom He wants
God is Provident and Allknowing
Their Prophet further told them As the evidence of his authority he will bring to you the Ark which will be a comfort to you from your Lord and a legacy of the household of Moses and Aaron
It will be carried by the angels
This is the evidence for you if you have faith
When Saul set forth with the army he said God will test you with a river
Those who drink its water will not be of my people and those who do not even taste the water or who only taste some of it from within the hollow of their hand will be my friends
They all drank the water except a few of them
When Saul and those who believed in him crossed the river his people said We do not have the strength to fight against Goliath and his army
Those who thought that they would meet God said How often with God s permission have small groups defeated the large ones
God is with those who exercise patience
Advancing towards Goliath and his army they prayed to God for patience steadfastness in battle and for victory over the unbelievers
They defeated their enemy through God s will
David slew Goliath and God granted David the kingdom and wisdom and also taught him whatever He wanted
Had God not made one group of people repel the other the earth would have become full of corruption but God is generous to His creatures
Muhammad these are the revelations which We recite to you for a genuine purpose
Certainly you are one of Our Messengers
We gave some of Our Messengers preference over others
To some of them God spoke and He raised the rank of some others
We gave authoritative proofs to Jesus son of Mary and supported him by the Holy Spirit
Had God wanted the generations who lived after those Messengers would not have fought each other after the authority had come to them
But they differed among themselves some of them believed in the authority and others denied it
They would not have fought each other had God wanted but God does as He wills
Believers out of what We have given you spend for the cause of God before the coming of the day when there will be no trading no friendship and no intercession
Those who deny the Truth are unjust
God exists
There is no God but He the Everlasting and the Guardian of life
Drowsiness or sleep do not seize him
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
No one can intercede with Him for others except by His permission
He knows about people s present and past
No one can grasp anything from His knowledge besides what He has permitted them to grasp
The heavens and the earth are under His dominion
He does not experience fatigue in preserving them both
He is the Highest and the Greatest
There is no compulsion in religion
Certainly right has become clearly distinct from wrong
Whoever rejects the devil and believes in God has firmly taken hold of a strong handle that never breaks
God is Allhearing and knowing
God is the Guardian of the believers and it is He who takes them out of darkness into light
The Devil is the guardian of those who deny the Truth and he leads them from light to darkness
These are the dwellers of hell wherein they will live forever
Muhammad have you heard about the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord for His granting him authority
Abraham said It is only my Lord who gives life and causes things to die His opponent said I also can give life and make things die
Abraham said God causes the sun to come up from the East You make it come from the West
Thus the unbeliever was confounded God does not guide the unjust people
Or have you heard of the one who on passing through an empty and ruined town said When will God bring it to life
God caused him to die and brought him back to life after a hundred years and then asked him How long have you been here
He replied One day or part of a day
The Lord said No you have been here for one hundred years Look at your food and drink
They have not yet decayed
But look at your donkey and its bones
To make your case evidence of the Truth for the people see how we bring the bones together and cover them with flesh
When he learned the whole story he said Now I know that God has power over all things
When Abraham prayed Lord show me how you bring the dead back to life the Lord said Do you not yet believe
Abraham replied I believe but want more confidence for my heart
God told him Take four birds induce them to come to you cut and scatter their bodies leaving parts on every mountain top then call them and they will swiftly come to you
Know that God is Majestic and Wise
Spending money for the cause of God is as the seed from which seven ears may grow each bearing one hundred grains
God gives in multiples to those whom He wants
God is Munificent and Allknowing
Those who spend their property for the cause of God and do not make the recipient feel obliged or insulted shall receive their reward from God
They will have no fear nor will they be grieved
Instructive words and forgiveness are better than charity that may cause an insult to the recipient
God is Rich and Forbearing
Believers do not make your charities fruitless by reproachfully reminding the recipient of your favor or making them feel insulted like the one who spends his property to show off and who has no faith in God or belief in the Day of Judgment
The example of his deed is as though some soil has gathered on a rock and after a rain fall it turns hard and barren
Such people can not benefit from what they have earned
God does not guide the unbelievers
The example of those who spend their property to please God out of their firm and sincere intention is as the garden on a fertile land which after a heavy rainfall or even a drizzle yields double produce
God is WellAware of what you do
What do you think of the case of one of you who wishes to have a garden of palmtrees and grapes with water flowing therein and producing all kinds of fruits especially if he is well advanced in age and has weak children who need support and then a hurricane with fire in it strikes the garden and burns it to the ground
This is how God explains to you His evidence so that you may think
Believers spend for the cause of God from the good things that you earn and from what we have made the earth yield for you
Do not even think of spending for the cause of God worthless things that you yourselves would be reluctant to accept
Know that God is Selfsufficient and Glorious
Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to commit sin
God promises you forgiveness and favors
God is Munificent and Allknowing
God gives wisdom to anyone whom He wants
Whoever is given wisdom certainly has received much good
Only people of reason can grasp this
God knows all about whatever you spend for His cause or any vows that you make The unjust people have no helper
It is not bad to give alms in public However if you give them privately to the poor it would be better for you and an expiation for some of your sins
God is WellAware of what you do
Muhammad you do not have to guide them
God guides whomever He wants
Whatever you spend for the cause of God is for your own good provided you do not spend anything but to please God
For anything good that you may give for the cause of God you will receive sufficient reward and no injustice will be done to you
If the recipients of charity are the poor whose poverty because of their striving for the cause of God has become an obstacle for them and who do not have the ability to travel in the land they seem rich compared to the ignorant because of their modest behavior
You would know them by their faces
They would never earnestly ask people for help
God knows well whatever wealth you spend for the cause of God
Those who spend their property for the cause of God any time during the day or night in public or in private will receive their reward from their Lord
There will be no fear for them nor will they grieve
Those who take unlawful interest will stand before God on the Day of Judgment as those who suffer from a mental imbalance because of Satan s touch they have said that trade is just like unlawful interest
God has made trade lawful and has forbidden unlawful interest
One who has received advice from his Lord and has stopped committing sins will be rewarded for his previous good deeds
His affairs will be in the hands of God
But one who turns back to committing sins will be of the dwellers of hell wherein he will live forever
God makes unlawful interest devoid of all blessings and causes charity to increase
God does not love sinful unbelievers
The righteously striving believers who are steadfast in their prayers and pay the zakat will receive their reward from God
They will have no fear nor will they grieve
Believers have fear of God and give up whatever unlawful interest you still demand from others if you are indeed true believers
If you will not give up the unlawful interest which you demand know that you are in the state of war with God and His Messenger
But if you repent you will have your capital without being wronged or having done wrong to others
One who faces hardship in paying his debts must be given time until his financial condition improves
Would that you knew that waiving such a loan as charity would be better for you
Safeguard yourselves against the day when you will return to God and every soul will be rewarded according to its deeds without being wronged
Believers if you take a loan for a known period of time have a just scribe write it down for you
The scribe should not refuse to do this as God has taught him
The debtor should dictate without any omission and have fear of God his Lord
If the debtor is a fool a minor or one who is unable to dictate his guardian should act with justice as his representative
Let two men or one man and two women whom you choose bear witness to the contract so that if one of them makes a mistake the other could correct him
The witness must not refuse to testify when their testimony is needed
Do not disdain writing down a small or a large contract with all the details
A written record of the contract is more just in the sight of God more helpful for the witness and a more scrupulous way to avoid doubt
However if everything in the contract is exchanged at the same time there is no sin in not writing it down
Let some people bear witness to your trade contracts but the scribe or witness must not be harmed it is a sin to harm them
Have fear of God
God teaches you
He has knowledge of all things
If you are on a journey where you cannot find a scribe finalize your contract in the form of a deposit in which the goods are already given to the parties If you trust each other in such a contract let him pay back what he has entrusted you with and have fear of God his Lord
Do not refuse to testify to what you bore witness
Whoever does so has committed a sin
God knows what you do
God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth
God will call you to account for all that you may reveal from your souls and all that you may conceal
God will forgive or punish whomever He wants
God has power over all things
The Messengers and the believers have faith in what was revealed to them from their Lord
Everyone of them believed in God His angels His Books and His Messengers saying We find no difference among the Messengers of God
They also have said We heard God s commands and obeyed them
Lord we need Your forgiveness and to You we shall return
God does not impose on any soul a responsibility beyond its ability
Every soul receives whatever it gains and is liable for whatever it does
Lord do not hold us responsible for our forgetfulness and mistakes
Lord do not lay upon us the burden that You laid on those who lived before us
Lord do not lay on us what we cannot afford
Ignore and forgive our sins
Have mercy on us You are our Lord
Help us against the unbelievers
Alif Lam
God exists He is the only Lord the Everlasting and the Guardian of life
He has sent the Book Quran to you Muhammad in all Truth It confirms the original Bible
He revealed the Torah and the Gospel
before as a guide for the people and now He has revealed the criteria of discerning right from wrong
Those who reject the revelations of God will face the most severe torment
God is Majestic and capable to revenge
Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from God
It is God who shapes you in the wombs as He wills
He is the only Lord the Majestic and Allwise
It is God who has revealed the Book to you in which some verses are clear statements which accept no interpretation and these are the fundamental ideas of the Book while other verses may have several possibilities
Those whose hearts are perverse follow the unclear statements in pursuit of their own mischievous goals by interpreting them in a way that will suit their own purpose
No one knows its true interpretations except God and those who have a firm grounding in knowledge say We believe in it
All its verses are from our Lord No one can grasp this fact except the people of reason
They say Lord do not cause our hearts to deviate from Your guidance and grant us mercy
You are the Most Awarding One
Lord it is certain that one day You will gather all the people together
God does not break His promise
The wealth and children of the unbelievers will never serve them as a substitute for their belief in God
Such people will be the fuel for the fire
They do as the people of Pharaoh and those who lived before them did
They called Our revelations mere lies
God punished them for their sins
God is stern in His retribution
Muhammad tell the unbelievers that they will soon be defeated and driven into Hell a terrible dwelling
There certainly is evidence of the existence of God for you in the case of the two armies
One of them fought for the cause of God
The other were disbelievers
The disbelievers appeared to be twice the size of the believers
However God supports through His help whomever He wants
It is a good lesson for the people of true vision
Worldly desires wives children accumulated treasures of gold and silver horses of noble breed cattle and farms are all made to seem attractive to men
All these are the bounties of the worldly life but in the life to come God has the best place for people to dwell
Muhammad ask them Shall I tell you what is far superior to worldly pleasures
Those who have fear of God will have as their reward gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever with their purified spouses and with the consent of God
God knows all about His servants
Such will be the reward of those who say Lord we have believed in you Forgive us our sins and save us from the torment of fire
who exercise patience speak the truth who are devoted in prayer spend their property for the cause of God and seek forgiveness from God during the last part of the night
God Himself testifies that He is the only Lord
The angels and the men of knowledge and justice testify that God is the only Lord the Majestic and Allwise
In the sight of God Islam is the religion
The People of the Book created differences in the matters of religion because of their hostility among themselves only after knowledge had come to them
Let whoever denies the revelations of God know that the reckoning of God is swift
Muhammad if the People of the Book argue against you say I and those who follow me have submitted ourselves to God
Ask the People of the Book and the illiterate ones Have you embraced Islam
If they embrace Islam they will find guidance but if they turn away your task is just to preach
God knows all about His servants
Warn those who deny the revelations of God and unjustly slay the Prophets and those who call people to be just that they will suffer a painful torment
The deeds of such people are made devoid of all virtue in both this life and the life to come There will be no one to help them
Muhammad consider those who have received a share of the Book
When they refer to the Book in order to judge amongst themselves a group of them turn away with disregard
because of their belief that the fire will only touch them for a few days
This fabricated belief has deceived them in matters of their religion
What will happen to their belief when We bring them together on the Inevitable Day when every soul will be justly recompensed for its deeds
Muhammad say Lord Owner of the Kingdom You give authority to whomever You want and take it away from whomever You want
You give honor to whomever You want and humiliate whomever You want
In Your hands is all virtue and You have power over all things
You cause the day to enter into the night and the night to enter into the day
You cause the living to come out of the dead and the dead to come out of the living
You give sustenance to whomever You want without keeping an account
The believers must not establish friendship with the unbelievers in preference to the faithful
Whoever does so has nothing to hope for from God unless he does it out of fear or taqiyah pious dissimulation
God warns you about Himself
To God do all things return
Muhammad tell them God knows all that you may conceal in your hearts or you may reveal
He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
He has power over all things
On the day when every soul will see its good and bad deeds right before its very eyes it will wish for the longest period of time to separate it from its bad deeds
God warns you about Himself God is Compassionate to His servants
Muhammad tell them If you love God follow me God will love you and forgive your sins
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Tell them Obey God and the Messenger
If they turn away let it be known that God does not love the unbelievers
God chose and gave distinction to Adam Noah the family of Abraham and Imran over all the people of the world
They were the offspring of one another
God is Allhearing and Allseeing
Remember when Imran s wife prayed to her Lord saying I have made a vow to dedicate to Your service whatever is in my womb
Lord accept it from me
You are Allhearing and Allknowing
When the baby was born she said Lord it is a female
God knew this
Male and female are not alike I have named her Mary
I pray that You will keep her and her offspring safe from Satan the condemned one
Her Lord graciously accepted the offer and made Mary grow up pure and beautiful Zachariah took custody of her
Whenever he went to visit her in her place of worship he would find with her some food
He would ask her Where did this food come from She would reply God has sent it
God gives sustenance to whomever He wants without keeping an account
Zachariah prayed to his Lord there saying Lord grant me by Your Grace virtuous offspring
You hear all prayers
When he was standing during prayer in his place of worship the angels called him saying God gives you the glad news of the birth of your son John who will be a confirmation of Jesus the Word of God He will become a chaste noble leader and one of the righteous Prophets
He said How can there be a son for me when I am already senile and my wife is barren
The angel replied God does as He wills
Zachariah prayed to God saying Lord show me the evidence that it is Divine revelation The Lord replied You must not speak to people for three days except with gestures
Commemorate your Lord often and glorify Him in the early mornings and the evenings
Behold the angels told Mary God had chosen you purified you and given you distinction over all women
Mary pray devotedly to your Lord prostrate yourself before Him and bow down with those who bow down before Him
Muhammad that was some of the news about the unseen that We have revealed to you
You were not among those who cast lots by throwing their arrows to find out who would take custody of Mary nor were you among those who disputed the matter
Behold the angels told Mary God has given you the glad news of the coming birth of a son whom He calls His Word whose name will be Messiah Jesus son of Mary who will be a man of honor in this life and the life to come and who will be one of the ones nearest to God
He will speak to the people while in his cradle and preach to them when he will be a man He will be one of the righteous ones
Mary said How can there be a son for me when no mortal has touched me The angel replied That is how God creates whatever He wants
When He decides to do something He just orders it to exist and it comes into existence
God will give Jesus wisdom and teach him the Book the Torah and the Gospel
He will be a Messenger of God to the Israelites to whom he will say I have brought you a miracle from your Lord
I can create for you something from clay in the form of a bird
When I blow into it it will become a real bird by the permission of God
I can heal the blind and the lepers and bring the dead back to life by the permission of God
I can tell you about what you eat and what you store in your homes
This is a miracle for you if you want to have faith
I testify to what is true in the Torah and make lawful for you some of the things that were made unlawful I have brought you a miracle from your Lord
Have fear of God and obey me
God is my Lord as well as yours
Worship Him for this is the right path
When Jesus found them denying the truth he said Who will help me in the cause of God
The disciples replied We are the helpers of God
We believe in Him
Jesus bear witness that we have submitted ourselves to His will
They prayed Lord we have believed in what You have revealed to Your Messenger and we have followed him
Write down our names with those who testify in support of the Truth
The unbelievers plotted and God planned but God is a much better planner
He told Jesus I will save you from your enemies raise you to Myself keep you clean from the association with the disbelievers and give superiority to your followers over the unbelievers until the Day of Judgment
On that day you will all return to Me and I shall resolve your dispute
I shall sternly punish the unbelievers in this life and in the life to come and no one will help them
However to the righteously striving believers I shall give their reward in full measure
God does not love the unjust
Muhammad what we recite to you are revelations and words of wisdom
To God the case of Jesus is as that of Adam whom He created from the earth and then said Exist and Adam came into existence
Muhammad the essence of the Truth is from your Lord
Never have any doubt about it
If anyone disputes your prophesy after knowledge has come to you say Let each of us bring our children women our people and ourselves to one place and pray to God to condemn the liars among us
This is the true story of Jesus
There is no Lord but God
It is God who is Majestic and Allwise
If they turn away from the Truth let it be known that God knows well the evildoers
Muhammad say to the People of the Book We must come to a common term
Let us worship no one except God nor consider anything equal to Him nor regard any of us as our Lord besides God
However if they turn away from the Truth tell them Bear witness that we have submitted ourselves to the will of God
Ask the People of the Book Why do you argue about Abraham
The Torah and Gospel were revealed only after him Why do you not understand
You even argue about what is already known to you What can you learn from arguing about that which you have no knowledge
God knows but you do not know
Abraham was not a Jew or a Christian
He was an upright person who had submitted himself to the will of God Abraham was not a pagan
The nearest people to Abraham among mankind are those who followed him this Prophet Muhammad and the true believers
God is the Guardian of the true believers
A group among the People of the Book would love to mislead you but they mislead no one but themselves However they do not realize it
Muhammad say People of the Book why do you deny the revelation of God the Quran even though you know very well that it is from God
Why do you mix truth with falsehood and knowingly hide the truth
Some of the People of the Book say Believe in what is revealed to the Muslims during the day only and abandon it in the evening
This will perhaps make them give up their religion
They also say Do not believe anyone except those who follow your religion so that no one may have what you have received or may argue with you before your Lord Muhammad tell them The only guidance is the guidance of God
All favors are in the hands of God
He grants His favors to whomever He wants
He is Munificent and Allknowing
God grants priority in granting mercy to whomever He wants
God s favors are great
If you entrust some of the People of the Book with a large quantity of gold they will return it to you while if you entrust others among them with a small quantity of gold they will not give it back to you unless you keep insisting on its return
For they say We are not bound to keep our words with the illiterate people and they themselves knowingly ascribe false statements to God
Those who keep their promise and observe piety should know that God certainly loves the pious ones
Those who sell their covenant with God and their promises for a small price will have no share in the life hereafter
God will not speak to them nor will He look at them on the Day of Judgment nor will He purify them
They will face a painful torment
A group among the People of the Book when reading the Bible deliberately mispronounce words in order to change their meaning try to show that what they have read is from the true Bible
In fact what they have read is not from the true Bible
They say What we read is from God
In reality it is not from God
They knowingly ascribe false statements to God
God would never give the Book authority or prophesy to any person who would tell others to be his servants instead of being the servants of God
He would rather tell them to worship God for they had been teaching and studying the Book
A Prophet would never order you to take the angels and the Prophets as your Lords
Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted yourselves to God
When God made a covenant with the Prophets saying When I give you the Book and wisdom and a Messenger comes to you who will testify to the guidance which you have received from Me you must believe in him and help him then He asked them Do you affirm and accept my covenant
They replied Yes we affirm it
The Lord said Then bear witness to this and I shall bear witness with you
After this whoever turns away will be of the evildoers
Do they want a religion other than the religion of God when all that is in the heavens and the earth have submitted themselves to His will either by their own free will or by force To God do all things return
Muhammad say We believe in God and in that which has been revealed to us and in that which was revealed to Abraham Ishmael Isaac Jacob and their descendants We believe in that which was given to Moses Jesus and the Prophets by their Lord
We make no distinction between them and we have submitted ourselves to the will of God
No religion other than Islam submission to the will of God will be accepted from anyone Whoever follows a religion other than Islam will be lost on the Day of Judgment
Why would God guide a people who disbelieves after having had faith who have found the Messenger to be truthful and who have received authoritative evidence
God does not guide the unjust
What they will gain will be the condemnation of God the angels and all people
with which they will live forever
Their torment will not be relieved and no attention will be paid to them
However to those who repent afterwards and reform themselves God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who disbelieve after having been believers and increase their disbelief are lost and their repentance will not be accepted
From those who have rejected the truth and died in disbelief no ransom will be accepted even though they may pay a whole earth of gold
They will suffer a painful torment and no one will help them
You can never have extended virtue and righteousness unless you spend part of what you dearly love for the cause of God
God knows very well whatever you spend for His cause
All food was lawful for the children of Israel except for what Israel had deemed unlawful for himself before the Torah was revealed
Muhammad ask them to bring the Torah and read it if they are true in their claim that all food was not unlawful for the children of Israel
Whoever ascribes falsehood to God despite of all the evidence is unjust
Muhammad say God has spoken the Truth
Follow the upright tradition of Abraham who was not an idolater
The first house of worship that God assigned to men was in Bakka another name of Mecca It is a blessed one and a guide for all people
In Bakka there are many clear signs evidence of the existence of God
Among them is the spot where Abraham stood
Whoever seeks refuge therein will be protected by the laws of amnesty Those who have the means and ability have a duty to God to visit the House and perform the hajj pilgrimage rituals
The unbelievers should know that God is Independent of all creatures
Muhammad ask the People of the Book Why do you deny the revelations of God when He is WellAware of your dealings
Ask them Why do you create obstacles in the way of God for those who believe in Him trying to make His way seem crooked when you know that it is straight
God is not unaware of what you do
Believers if you obey a certain group among the People of the Book they will turn you back to disbelief
How could you turn back to disbelief when the words of God are recited to you and you have in your midst His Messenger
Those who seek the protection of God will certainly be guided to the right path
Believers have fear of God as you should and die only as Muslims having submitted to the will of God
All of you united hold fast to the rope of God the Quran and His Messenger and recall how He favored you when your hostility to each other had torn you apart
He united your hearts in one faith and through His Grace you became brothers
You were on the verge of falling headlong into the abyss of fire but God saved you
This is how God explains to you His revelations so that you may have the right guidance
Let there be a group among you who will invite others to do good deeds command them to obey the Law and prohibit them from committing sins
These people will have eternal happiness
Do not be like those who turned into quarrelling sects after receiving clear authoritative evidence
They will suffer a great torment
On the day when some faces will become white and others black God will ask the people with the faces which have become black Why did you give up your faith
Now suffer the torment for your disbelief
The people whose faces have become white will enjoy the mercy of God with which they will live forever
Such are God s revelations which We explain to you Muhammad for a genuine purpose
God does not want injustice for any of His creatures
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and to Him do all things return
You are the best nation that ever existed among humanity You command people to good and prohibit them from evil and you believe in God
Had the People of the Book accepted the faith Islam it would certainly have been better for them
Some of them have faith but most of them are evil doers
They can never harm you beyond annoyance
In a fight they will turn back in defeat and they will not be helped
Humiliation will strike them wherever they seek protection except when they seek protection from God and the people
They have incurred the wrath of God unto themselves and have been struck with destitution for their rejection of the revelations of God and for unjustly murdering the Prophets
It is all because of their transgression and rebellion
The People of the Book are not all the same
Some of them are straightforward They recite the words of God in prostration at night
They believe in God and the Day of Judgment They command people to follow good prohibit others from committing evil and compete with each other in doing good deeds
These are the righteous ones
They will never be denied the rewards of their good deeds
God knows well about the pious
The wealth and the children of the unbelievers can never make them independent of God
They are the dwellers of hell wherein they will live forever
What they spend in this life is like the freezing wind that may strike and destroy the farms of the people who have wronged themselves
God has not done injustice to them but they have wronged themselves
Believers do not expose your privacy to the unbelievers
They like to mislead you and see that you are seriously harmed
Signs of animosity from their mouths have already become audible but what they hide in their heads is even worse
We have certainly made Our evidence clear if only you would consider it
There are people whom you love but they do not love you despite your belief in all the heavenly Books
On meeting you They proclaim belief on meeting you but in private bite their fingers at you in anger
Tell them Perish in your rage
God knows well what is in everyone s hearts
They hate to see your success and rejoice if any misfortune befalls you
If you will be patient and pious their plots can cause no harm to you
God has control over all their actions
Muhammad remember the morning when you left home to show the believers their position in the battle
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Two groups among you almost lost courage despite having God as their Guardian
The believers should always have trust in God
God gave you victory in the battle of Badr where your forces were much weaker than those of the enemy
Have fear of God so that you may give Him thanks
Also remember when you said to the believers Is it not enough that your Lord is helping you with a force of three thousand angels sent from the heavens
Certainly if you have patience and piety even if the enemy attacks immediately after this God will help you with another force of five thousand angels all splendidly and or distinctly marked dressed
The sending of the angels is a glad news from your Lord so that you would have more confidence in Him
No victory is real unless it is from God the Majestic and Allwise
They are sent to break the power of the unbelievers or disgrace them and make them return after having lost all hope
Muhammad it is not your concern whether He forgives them or punishes them for they are unjust
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
He may forgive or punish whomever He wants
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers do not accept illegal interest in order to increase your wealth many times over
Have fear of God so that you will have everlasting happiness
Save yourselves from the fire which is prepared for the unbelievers
Obey God and the Messenger so that you may receive mercy
Hasten to obtain forgiveness from your Lord and to qualify yourselves for Paradise Paradise vast as the heavens and the earth is prepared for the pious
who spend their property for the cause of God in prosperity as well as in adversity and who also harness their anger and forgive the people
God loves the righteous ones
Paradise is also for those who when committing a sin or doing injustice to themselves remember God and ask Him to forgive their sins
Who can forgive sins besides God
And who do not knowingly persist in their mistakes
Their reward will be forgiveness from their Lord and gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
How blessed is the reward of those who labor
Different traditions existed in the past
Travel in the land and find out about the fate of those who rejected the Truth
This Quran is a reminder for the people and a guide and advice for the pious
Do not be discouraged or grieved
You alone will have true dignity if you only are true believers
If you get hurt certainly others have also experienced injuries
We have made people pass through the different turns of history so that God would know the true believers have some of you bear witness to the people s deeds God does not love the unjust
test the faith of the believers and deprive the unbelievers of His blessings
Did you think that you could go to Paradise before God knew which of you fought for His cause and which of you bore patience
You certainly wished to die for the cause of God before you actually faced death
Then you faced death in the battlefield and only a few of you had the true desire to die
Muhammad is only a Messenger
There lived other Messengers before him
Should Muhammad die or be slain would you then turn back to your preIslamic behavior
Whoever does so can cause no harm to God
God will reward those who give thanks
No one can die without the permission of God
This is a written decree of the appointed term for life
We shall give worldly gains to whoever wants them Those who want rewards in the life hereafter will also receive them
We reward those who give thanks
Many godly people fought to help the Prophets in the cause of God
They did not lose courage show weakness or give in when facing hardships in their fight for the cause of God
God loves those who have patience
The only words that they spoke were Lord forgive our sins and our excess in our dealings make us steadfast in the fight for Your cause and grant us victory over the unbelievers
God gave them their reward in this world and the best reward of the life to come
God loves the righteous ones
Believers if you obey the unbelievers they will turn you back to disbelief and you will become lost
God is your Guardian and the best Helper
We shall cause terror to enter the hearts of the faithless for their considering things equal to God without authoritative evidence
Their abode will be fire a terrible dwelling for the unjust
God certainly fulfilled His promise to you when you were fighting the unbelievers by His permission
Even after We showed you what you wanted you began to lose courage started quarreling with each other and disobeyed God s orders Some of you want worldly gains and others of you want rewards in the hereafter
Then He let you face defeat in order to test you
However He forgave you
God is Gracious to the believers
Believers remember when you were fleeing without even glancing to either side even though the Messengers were calling you back God made you suffer sorrow upon sorrow to make you forget your grief of what you had lost and the injuries you had suffered
God is WellAware of what you do
After the sorrows you suffered He sent you relief and some of you were encompassed by slumber
To some others of you your lives were so important that you like ignorant people began thinking suspiciously of God saying Do we have any say in the matter
Muhammad tell them All matters belong to God
They try to hide within their souls what they do not reveal to you They say Had we had the matter in our hands we would not have been killed there
Tell them Even if you had stayed in your own homes your sworn enemies could have attacked you and slain you while you were in your beds God wanted to test you and purge what existed in your hearts
God knows what the hearts contain Because of some of your bad deeds those of you who ran away when you faced the enemy were misled by Satan
God forgave you for He is Allforgiving and Forbearing
Believers do not be like the unbelievers who said of their brothers who travelled in the land or took part in a fight Had they stayed with us they would not have died or been killed
God will only cause regret to enter their hearts
It is God who gives life and causes people to die
God is Well Aware of what you do
If you were to die or to be killed for the cause of God certainly His forgiveness and mercy is far better than your worldly gains
If you die or are slain certainly you will all be brought before God
Only through the Divine Mercy have you Muhammad been able to deal with your followers so gently
If you had been stern and hardhearted they would all have deserted you a long time ago
Forgive them and ask God to forgive their sins and consult with them in certain matters But when you reach a decision trust God
God loves those who trust Him
If God is your helper no one can defeat you
However if He abandons you who would help you
The true believers trust in God
No Prophet can ever be treacherous
A treacherous person will be brought before God on the Day of Judgment with his treacherous deeds
Then every soul will be recompensed for its works without being wronged
Are those who seek God s pleasure equal to those who incur His wrath and whose dwelling will be hell the terrible destination
People are of various grades in the sight of God
God is WellAware of all that they do
God granted a great favor to the believers by sending a Messenger from their own people to recite to them God s revelations to purify them of moral defects to teach them the Book and to give them wisdom
Before this they had lived in manifest error
If misfortune befell you the believers your enemies had suffered twice as much in the battle of Badr but you asked Where did the misfortune come from
Muhammad tell them It came from yourselves
God has power over all things
What befell you when the two armies confronted each other was by the permission of God so that He would know who were the true believers
and who were the hypocrites
When the hypocrites were asked to fight for the cause of God or to defend the city they replied Had we known before that you would fight we would certainly not have followed you
At that time they were closer to disbelief than to faith
They speak words that do not come from their hearts
God knows well whatever they try to hide
There are those who themselves did not join the others in fighting for the cause of God and said about their brothers Had they listened to us and stayed at home they would not have been killed Muhammad tell them to save themselves from death if they are true in their claim
Do not think of those slain for the cause of God as dead
They are alive with their Lord and receive sustenance from Him
They are pleased with the favor from their Lord and have received the glad news that those who follow them will have no fear nor will they be grieved
that they will be rewarded with bounties and favors from their Lord and that God will not neglect the reward of the true believers
The righteous and pious of those who have pledged obedience to God and the Messenger after injury had befallen them will receive a great reward
Such people when warned to fear those who are gathered against them are strengthened in their faith and say God is Allsufficient as our Guardian
They returned with the favors and the bounties of God untouched by evil and followed by the pleasure of God
God s favor is great
It is Satan who frightens his friends
Do not be afraid of them enemies but have fear of Me if you truly believe
Muhammad do not be grieved because of some people s haste to disbelieve
They can do no harm to God God has decided not to give them any share in the life hereafter
There will be a great torment for them
Those who have traded faith in exchange for disbelief can never do any harm to God
There will be a painful torment for them
The unbelievers must not think that Our respite is for their good
We only give them time to let them increase their sins
For them there will be a humiliating torment
God left the believers in their existing state for no other reason than to distinguish the evildoers from the virtuous ones
God does not inform you of the unseen
He chooses for such information anyone of His Messengers that He wants
Have faith in God and in His Messengers
If you have faith and are pious there will be a great reward for you
Those who are avaricious of the favors that God has given them should not think that this is good for them
Avarice is evil and whatever they are avaricious about will be tied to their necks on the Day of Judgment
To God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth
God is Well Aware of what you do
God certainly has heard the words of those who said God is poor and we are wealthy
We shall write down what they have said and their murder of the Prophets without reason and We shall tell them to suffer the burning torment
This is only the result of their deeds God is not unjust to His servants
Muhammad say to those who say God has commanded us not to believe any Messenger unless he offers a burnt offering Muhammad say Messengers came to you before me with certain miracles and with that which you had asked for burnt offering
Why then did you slay them if you were true in your claim
If they reject you they had certainly rejected the Messengers who lived before you and who showed them authoritative evidence smaller Books and the Book of enlightenment
Every soul is destined to experience the agony of death
You Muslims will receive the recompense for your deeds on the Day of Judgment
To be saved from the fire and admitted to Paradise is certainly a great triumph
The worldly life is no more than a deceitful possession
You believers will certainly be tested by the loss of your property and lives and you will hear a great many grieving words from the People of the Book and the pagans
If you will have patience and piety it will be a sign of firm determination and steadfastness in life
When God made a covenant with the People of the Book saying Tell the people about it Muhammad s prophesy without hiding any part therefrom they threw it behind their backs and sold it for a very small price
What a miserable bargain
Do not think that those who are happy with their possessions and positions and those who love to be praised for what they themselves have not done can ever be saved from torment
For them there will be a painful punishment
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and He has power over all things
The creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and the night are evidence of the existence of God for people of reason
It is these who commemorate God while standing sitting or resting on their sides and who think about the creation of the heavens and the earth and say Lord you have not created all this without reason
Glory be to you
Lord save us from the torment of the fire
Those whom You submit to the fire are certainly disgraced There is no helper for the unjust
Lord we have heard the person calling to the faith and have accepted his call
Forgive our sins expiate our bad deeds and let us die with the righteous ones
Lord grant us the victory that You have promised your Messenger and do not disgrace us on the Day of Judgment You are the One who never ignores His promise
Their Lord answered their prayers saying I do not neglect anyone s labor whether the laborer be male or female
You are all related to one another
Those who migrated from Mecca those who were expelled from their homes those who were tortured for My cause and those who fought and were killed for My cause will find their sins expiated by Me and I will admit them into the gardens wherein streams flow
It will be their reward from God Who grants the best rewards
Muhammad do not be deceived by the changing activities of the unbelievers in different parts of the land
Their gains are only a means of enjoyment in this life
However their destination is hell the terrible dwelling
For those who have fear of their Lord there will be gardens wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever as a gift from their Lord
God has the best reward for the virtuous people
There are some among the People of the Book who believe in God and what is revealed to you and to them They are humble before God and do not trade God s revelations for a small price
They will receive their reward from their Lord
God s reckoning is swift
Believers have patience help each other with patience establish good relations with one another and have fear of God so that you may have everlasting happiness
People have fear of your Lord who has created you from a single soul From it He created your spouse and through them He populated the land with many men and women
Have fear of the One by whose Name you swear to settle your differences and have respect for your relatives
God certainly keeps watch over you
Give to the orphans their property
Do not exchange the pure for the filthy and do not spend the property of orphans along with your own this would be a great sin
With respect to marrying widows if you are afraid of not being able to maintain justice with her children marry another woman of your choice or two or three or four who have no children If you cannot maintain equality with more than one wife marry only one or your slavegirl
This keeps you from acting against justice
Pay the women their dowry as though it were a gift
However if they allow you to keep a part of it as a favor to you you may spend it with pleasure
Do not give to people weak of understanding your property for which God has made you to supervise
Feed and clothe such people and speak to them in a reasonable way
Before returning orphan s property to them make sure that they have reached maturity
Do not consume their property wastefully until such a time
The rich guardian should not take any of his ward s property However a poor guardian may use a reasonable portion
When you return their property make sure you have witness
God is a perfect in taking accounts
Male and female are entitled to their legal share in the legacy of their parents and relatives whether it be small or large
If relatives orphans or destitute people are present at the distribution of the legacy give them something and speak kindly to them
Those who are concerned about the welfare of their own children after their death should have fear of God when dealing with the orphans and guide them properly
Those who wrongfully consume the property of orphans are in fact consuming fire in their bellies and they will suffer the blazing fire
This is a commandment from your Lord After the payment of debts or anything bequeathed let the male inherit twice as much as the female
If there are more than two girls they will have twothirds of the legacy
If there is only one girl she will inherit half of the legacy
Parents of the deceased will each inherit onesixth of the legacy if the deceased has a surviving child however if no children survive the deceased and the heirs are the parents the mother will receive onethird of the legacy
The mother will receive onesixth of the legacy if the deceased has more than one surviving brother
These are the decreed shares according to the laws of God
Regardless of how you feel about your parents or children you do not know which of them is more beneficial to you
God is Allknowing and Allwise
If your wives die without any surviving children you will inherit half of their legacy If they have children you will inherit onefourth of their legacy after the debts and things bequeathed have been excluded from the legacy
After the payment of debts and things bequeathed have been excluded from the legacy your wives will inherit onefourth of your legacy if you have no surviving children
If you leave a child they will inherit one eighth of your legacy
If the deceased either male or female has no surviving heirs such as parents or children but has a brother or a sister the brother or sister will each inherit onesixth of the legacy
If there are more than just a brother or a sister they will share onethird of the legacy
This is after the payment of any debts and things bequeathed have been excluded from the legacy so that no one will be caused to suffer any loss
It is a guide from God the Allknowing and Forbearing
These are the laws of God
Whoever obeys God and His Messenger will be admitted to the gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever This is the greatest triumph
Whoever disobeys God and His Messenger and breaks His rules will be admitted to the fire wherein they will live forever suffering a humiliating torment
Those of your women who commit fornication let four Muslim witness testify to their act
If there is sufficient testimony confine them to their homes until they die or until God provides a way for their freedom
If any two people commit fornication punish them
If they repent and reform let them go
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God will only accept the repentance of those who commit evil in ignorance if they repent immediately
God is Allknowing and Allwise
There is no forgiveness for those who commit sin and do not repent until the last moment of their lives nor for those who die as unbelievers
For these people We have prepared a painful torment
Believers it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will as part of the legacy
Do not create difficulties for your wives in order to force them to giveup part of what you had given to them to set themselves free from the bond of marriage unless they have clearly committed adultery
Always treat them reasonably
If you dislike them you could be disliking that which God has filled with abundant good
If you want to divorce a woman so that you can marry another do not take back the dowry which you had paid even if what you paid was a large amount of gold
To do this is a slanderous act and a manifest sin
How can you take it back when you have had intimate relations and made a solemn agreement with each other
Do not marry from now on the exwives of your fathers for that custom was sinful loathsome and abominable
You are forbidden to marry your mothers daughters sisters paternal aunts maternal aunts nieces your fostermothers your fostersisters your mothersinlaw your stepdaughters whom you have brought up and with whose mothers you have had carnal relations
It would not be a sin to marry her if you did not have carnal relations with her mother
You are forbidden to marry the wives of your own sons and to marry two sisters at the same time without any adverse affect to the such relations of the past
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
You are forbidden to marry married women except your slavegirls This is the decree of God
Besides these it is lawful for you to marry other women if you pay their dower maintain chastity and do not commit indecency
If you marry them for the appointed time you must pay their dowries
There is no harm if you reach an understanding among yourselves about the dowry God is Allknowing and Allwise
If any of you do not have the means to marry a chaste believing woman marry your believing slavegirls
God knows best about your faith
You have the same faith
Marry them with the permission of their masters and if they are chaste and have avoided fornication and amorous activities give them their just dowries
If after marriage they commit adultery they should receive half of the punishment of a free woman who has committed the same crime
This is for those who fear falling into evil
It is better for you to have selfcontrol
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God wants to guide you explain to you the customs of those who lived before you and grant you forgiveness
He is Allknowing and Allwise
God wants to be merciful to you but those who follow their evil desires seek to lead you astray
God wants to relieve you of your burden all human beings were created weak
Believers do not exchange your property in wrongful ways unless it is in trade by mutual agreement Do not kill one another
God is Allmerciful to you
Whoever commits murder out of animosity and injustice will be burnt in hell fire
This is a very easy thing for God to do
If you avoid violating that which has been prohibited your lesser sins will be forgiven and you will be admitted into an exalted dwelling
Do not envy the favors which God has granted to some of you
Men and women will both be rewarded according to their deeds rather pray to God for His favors
God knows all things
We have chosen heirs for every legacy that parents and relatives may leave
Let those who have been promised a bequest receive their share of the legacy
God is Omnipresent
Men are the protectors of women because of the greater preference that God has given to some of them and because they financially support them
Among virtuous women are those who are steadfast in prayer and dependable in keeping the secrets that God has protected
Admonish women who disobey God s laws do not sleep with them and beat them
If they obey the laws of God do not try to find fault in them
God is High and Supreme
If there appears to be discord between a wife and her husband and if they desire reconciliation choose arbiters from the families of both sides
God will bring them together God is Allknowing and Allaware
Worship God and consider no one equal to Him
Be kind to your parents relatives orphans the destitute your near and distant neighbors your companions wayfarers and your slaves
God does not love the proud and boastful ones
the stingy ones who try to make others stingy or those who hide the favors that God has bestowed on them
We have prepared a humiliating torment for the disbelievers
those who spend their property out of a desire to show off and not because of their belief in God and the Day of Judgment and lastly those who choose Satan for a friend what an evil friend
How could it have harmed them if they had believed in God and the Last Day and spent their property for the cause of God
God knows them very well
God does not do even an atom s weight of injustice
A good deed is multiplied by God and richly rewarded
How will it be when We call for a witness from every nation and have you Muhammad testify against them all
At that time the disbelievers who disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they could be turned into dust and they will be able to hide nothing from God
Believers do not pray when you are drunk but instead wait until you can understand what you say Also do not pray when you have experienced a seminal discharge until after you have taken a bath unless you are on a journey
If while sick or on a journey you can find no water after having defecated or after having had carnal relations perform tayammum by touching your palms on the pure earth and wipe the upper part of your face and the backs of your hands
God is Gracious and Allforgiving
Have you seen those who had received a portion of the Book trade misguidance and try to make you too go astray
God knows who are your enemies
You need to have no guardian or helper other than God
Some Jews take certain words out of context and by twisting their tongues to make a jest out of the true religion say We heard and in our hearts disobeyed Muhammad ra ina be kind to us but they intend thereby the meaning in their own language Listen
May God turn you deaf They should have said We heard and obeyed
Muhammad listen and consider our question This would have been better for them and more righteous
God has condemned them for their disbelief thus no one except a few among them will have faith
People of the Book have faith in the Quran that We have revealed to confirm your Book before certain faces are changed and turned back We shall condemn them as We did the people of the Sabbath about whom God s decree had decisively been ordained
God does not forgive the sin of considering others equal to Him but He may choose to forgive other sins
Whoever believes in other gods besides Him has indulged in a great sin
Muhammad have you seen those who try to purify themselves
They should know that God only purifies whomever He wants and that the slightest wrong will not be done to such people
Consider how they create lies about God
This alone is a grave sin
Have you seen how those who had been given a share of the Book believe in idols and Satan and who say The disbelievers are better guided than the believers
God has condemned them
No one can help one who has been condemned by God
Even if they had a share in the Kingdom Divine authority they would not have given the smallest thing to anyone
Are they jealous of the favors that God has done to some people
We have given to the family of Abraham the Book Wisdom and a great Kingdom
Some have believed others have disbelieved and tried to prevent people from believing
For these people only the intense fire of hell is a sufficient punishment
We will make the rejectors of Our revelations suffer in hell fire
As soon as the fire destroys their skins We will give them new skins so that they may suffer more of the torment
God is Majestic and Allwise
We will admit the righteously striving believers into the gardens wherein streams flow
They will live therein forever in a cool shade with their pure spouses
God commands you to return that which had been entrusted to you to the rightful owners
Be just when passing judgment among people God s advice is the most noble
He sees and hears everything
Believers obey God His Messenger and your qualified leaders
If you have faith in God and the Day of Judgment refer to God and His Messenger concerning matters in which you differ
This would be a more virtuous and a better way of settling differences
Muhammad have you seen those who think that they have faith in what is revealed to you and to others before you yet choose to take their affairs to Satan for judgment even though they are commanded to deny him Satan wants to lead them far away from the right path
When the hypocrites are told to refer to God s revelations and to the Messenger they try to find excuses to stay away from you Muhammad
What would happen if they were to be afflicted by a disaster brought about by their own hands
They would then come to you swearing by God We only wanted to bring about friendship and reconciliation
God knows what is in their hearts
Muhammad ignore their faults advise them and tell them frankly about what is in their souls
We did not send any Messengers for any reason other than to be obeyed because of the will of God
If they ever do injustice to themselves and come to you Muhammad asking for God s forgiveness and if the Messenger also was to ask God to forgive them they would certainly find God Allforgiving and Allmerciful
I swear by your Lord that they will not be considered believers until they let you judge their disputes and then they will find nothing in their souls to prevent them from accepting your judgment thus submitting themselves to the will of God
Had We commanded them to kill themselves or abandon their homes only a few of them would have done it
If they had done what they had been advised to do it would have strengthened their faith
We would have given them a great reward
and guided them to the right path
One who obeys God and the Messenger is the friend of the Prophets saints martyrs and the righteous ones to whom God has granted His favors
They are the best friends that one can have
The favors of God are such and He knows very well how to reward you
Believers always be well prepared and on your guard March in small groups or all together
There are some among you who lag behind in battle and if you were to experience hardship they would say It was certainly due to God s favors to us that we were not present with them
but if you were to receive a favor from God they would certainly say We have been ignored as if there was no friendship among us Would that we had been there with them for we would have had a great success
Those who want to buy the life hereafter with this life should fight for the cause of God
We will give them a great reward whether they are killed or whether they are victorious
Why do you not fight for the cause of God or save the helpless men women and children who cry out Lord set us free from this town of wrong doers and send us a guardian and a helper
The believers fight for the cause of God
The unbelievers fight for the cause of the Satan
So fight against the friends of Satan for the evil plans of Satan are certainly weak
Have you not seen those who were told to stop fighting to say their prayers and pay the religious tax
When they were ordered to fight some of them feared other men as much as or more than they feared God and so they said Lord why have you ordered us to fight If only you would give us a little time
Muhammad tell them The pleasures of the worldly life are trivial
The life hereafter is best for the pious ones
You will not be treated the slightest bit unjustly
Wherever you are death will find you even if you hide yourselves in firmly constructed towers
Whenever people experience good fortune they say that it is from God but whenever they experience misfortune they say it is because of you Muhammad
Tell them Everything is from God
What is wrong with these people that they do not even try to understand
Whatever good you may receive is certainly from God and whatever you suffer is from yourselves
We have sent you Muhammad as a Messenger to people
God is a Sufficient witness to your truthfulness
One who obeys the Messenger has certainly obeyed God
You have not been sent to watch over those who turn away from you
They proclaim obedience to you but as soon as they leave at night a group of them make secret plans to do the contrary of what you have told them to do
God keeps the record of their nocturnal plans
Therefore leave them alone and put your trust in God He is Sufficient for you as your Guardian
Will they not ponder on the Quran
Had it not come from someone other than God they would have certainly found therein many contradictions
When they receive any news of peace or war they announce it in public
Had they told it to the Messenger or to their qualified leaders they could have used that information more properly
Were it not for the favor and mercy of God all but a few of them would have followed Satan
Thus Muhammad fight for the cause of God
You are only responsible for yourself
Rouse the believers and perhaps God will stop the evil designs of the unbelievers
God s punishment and retribution is the most severe
Whoever intercedes for a good purpose will receive his share of the reward but the intercession for an evil purpose only adds more to one s burden
God has control over all things
Answer a greeting in kinder words than those said to you in the greeting or at least as kind
God keeps account of all things
God exists He is the only Lord
He will gather you all together on the Day of Judgment which will certainly come
Who is more truthful than God
Why are you divided into two different parties concerning the hypocrites when God Himself has turned them to disbelief because of their misdeeds
Do you want to guide those whom God has caused to go astray
You cannot find guidance for those whom God has made to err
They wish you to become unbelievers as they themselves are
Do not establish friendship with them until they have abandoned their homes for the cause of God
If they betray you seize them and slay them wherever you find them
Do not establish friendship with them or seek their help
except with those who attach themselves to your allies or come to you with no desire to fight you or their own people
God could have given them power to fight you
Thus if they retreat stop fighting and come forward expressing faith in Islam God will not allow you to fight them
You will soon find others who seek security from you as well as from their own people but when they are invited to return to idol worship they do so enthusiastically Thus if they do not keep away from you nor come forward with a peace proposal nor desist from harming you apprehend and slay them wherever you find them for We have given you full control over them
A believer cannot slay another believer except by mistake for which the retaliation is to set free a believing slave and pay the appointed blood money to the relatives of the deceased unless the relatives wave aside the payment
If the person slain is from your enemies but himself is a believer the penalty is to set free a believing slave
If the person slain is one of those with whom you have a peace treaty the penalty is the same as that for a slain believer
If this is not possible the defendant has to fast for two consecutive months asking God to accept his repentance
He is Allknowing and Allwise
The punishment for one who purposely slays a believer will be to live in hell fire forever
God is angry with him and has condemned him He has prepared for him a great torment
Believers if you march with arms for the cause of God make sure that you know whom to fight
Do not accuse anyone who claims himself to be a Muslim of disbelief just for worldly gains
There is abundant bounty with God
Before you were also like them but God bestowed His favors upon you
Thus make sure that you know whom to fight
God is Well Aware of what you do
Among the believers those who stay at home without a good reason are not equal to those who strive for the cause of God in person or with their property
To those who strive for His cause in person or with their property God has granted a higher rank than to those who stay at home
God has promised that everyone will receive his proper share of the reward but He will grant a much greater reward to those striving for His cause than to those who stay home for no reason
God will grant those who strive high ranks forgiveness and mercy
He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When the angels take away from their bodies the souls of those who have wronged themselves they will ask them How did you live
They will reply We lived on earth in weakness and oppression
The angels will say Was not God s land vast enough for you to go wherever you could live in peace
The dwelling of these people will be hell fire a terrible destination
As for the really weak and oppressed men women and children who were not able to find any means of obtaining their freedom or of having the right guidance
perhaps God will forgive them He is Allmerciful and Allforgiving
One who abandons his home for the cause of God will find many places of refuge in the vast land and one who dies after having abandoned his home to get near to God and His Messenger will receive his reward from God
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When you are on a journey it is no sin to shorten your prayers if you are afraid of the mischief of the unbelievers
The unbelievers have always been your sworn enemies
Muhammad if you are among them your followers during a battle and you call them for prayer let a group of them carry their arms during prayer
After they have made their prostrations let them go back to watch the enemy and let the other group who has not yet prayed join you carrying their arms with due precaution
The unbelievers would love to find you neglecting your arms and property and would attack you suddenly
If rain or illness make you suffer you may place your arms aside during prayer but still observe due precaution
God has prepared a humiliating torment for the unbelievers
When you complete your prayer remember God all the time while standing sitting or reclining When you are safe say your prayers properly
It is a constant duty of the believers
Do not neglect the pursuit of the enemy
If you have suffered they too have suffered but you can at least expect from God what they can never expect
God is Allknowing and Allwise
We have revealed to you the Book in all Truth so that you judge among people by the laws of God
However never defend the treacherous ones
Seek forgiveness from God
He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Do not defend those who deceive themselves God does not love those who are treacherous and sinful
They hide their sins from other people but they cannot hide themselves from God who is constantly with them even when they hold nocturnal meetings a thing which God does not like
God comprehends all that they do
You defend them in this life but who will defend them against God on the Day of Judgment and who will be their attorney
One who commits a sin or does wrong to himself and then seeks forgiveness from God will find God Allforgiving and Allmerciful
One who commits sins has committed them against his own soul
God is Allknowing and Allwise
One who makes a mistake or commits a sin and ascribes it to an innocent person he only burdens himself with slander and a grave sin
Were it not for the favor and mercy of God some of them would have certainly tried to make you Muhammad go astray
However they cannot lead any one astray but themselves nor can they harm you
God has revealed the Book to you has given you wisdom and has taught you what you did not know
Certainly God s favor to you has been great
There is nothing good in much of their secret talks except for that which is for charity justice or for reconciliation among people to seek thereby the pleasure of God for which We will give a great reward
Whoever gives the Messenger a hard time even after having received clear guidance and follows a path other than that of the believers will be left alone
We will cast him into hell a terrible destination
God will not forgive the sin of considering something equal to Him but He may forgive the other sins of whomever He wants
One who considers anything equal to God has certainly gone far away from the right path
They the pagans only worship idols and Satan the persistent rebel
God condemned Satan when he said I will certainly take my revenge from Your servants
I will lead them astray induce in their hearts prolonged worldly desires command them to pierce the ears of their animals sacrificed for the idols and order them to change the religion of God
One who accepts Satan as his guardian instead of God has certainly incurred a great loss upon himself
Satan gives them false promises and tempts them to develop longings which can never be realized
Such people will dwell in hell fire from which they will not be able to escape
We will admit the righteously striving believers to Paradise wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever
God s promise is true for no one is more truthful than Him
Believers and People of the Book wishes alone can never provide you with salvation
Whoever commits evil will be punished accordingly and no one besides God will be his guardian or helper
Any believer male or female who acts righteously will enter Paradise and will not suffer the least bit of injustice
Whose religion is better than that in which one submits himself to God behaves righteously and follows the upright religion of Abraham God s chosen friend
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and He has control over all things
Muhammad they ask you concerning women
Tell them God will instruct you about them besides that which can be read in the Book about widows with children whom you wanted to marry without giving them their due rights and He will instruct you about the rights of the weak and oppressed children God commands you to maintain justice with the orphans
God knows all about whatever good you do
If a woman is afraid of her husband s ill treatment and desertion it will be no sin for both of them to reach a reconciliation
Reconciliation is good even though men s souls are swayed by greed
If you act righteously and be pious God is Well Aware of what you do
You will never be able to maintain justice among your wives and love them all equally no matter how hard you try
Do not give total preference to one of them leaving the other as if in suspense
If you do bring about reconciliation and maintain piety God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
If the marriage is terminated God will make each one of them financially independent
God is Munificent and Wise
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
We have told you and the People of the Book to have fear of God
If you all refuse to believe in Him know that to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God is a totally Sufficient Guardian
Had God wanted He could have destroyed you all and replaced you by another people He has the power to do so
Be it known to those who want worldly rewards that God holds the rewards for this life as well as the life to come
God is Allhearing and Allseeing
Believers be the supporters of justice and the testify to what you may have witnessed for the sake of God even against yourselves parents and relatives whether it be against the rich or the poor
God must be given preference over them
Let not your desires cause you to commit injustice
If you deviate from the truth in your testimony or decline to give your testimony at all know that God is Well Aware of what you do
Believers have faith in God and His Messenger the Book which is revealed to him and the Bible which has been revealed before
Whoever refuses to believe in God His angels Books Messengers and the Day of Judgment has gone far away from the right path
God will not forgive or guide to the right path those who first believe then disbelieve again believe and disbelieve and then increase their disbelief
Tell the hypocrites that for them there will be a painful torment
Do those who establish friendship with the disbelievers instead of the believers seek honor
Let them know that all honor belongs to God
God has told you believers in the Book that when you hear people disbelieving and mocking God s revelations do not sit with them unless they change the subject
You will become like them
God will gather all the hypocrites and the disbelievers together in hell fire
The hypocrites wait and watch
If God grants you victory they say Did we not help you If the unbelievers are victorious they say Did we not encourage you not to surrender to the believers and did we not protect you from them
God will judge among you on the Day of Judgment
He will never help the disbelievers against the believers
The hypocrites try to deceive God but He in fact deceives them
They stand up in prayer lazily just to show that they pray but in truth they remember God very little
They are hesitant people belonging to neither side
You can find no other way for one whom God has caused to go astray
Believers do not make unbelievers your intimate friends and supporters rather than believers
Do you want to establish clear evidence against yourselves before God
The hypocrites will be placed in the lowest bottom of the fire and none of you will ever find a helper for them except
those hypocrites who have repented put their trust in God and sincerely followed only His religion will live with the believers to whom God will give a great reward
Why should God punish you if you give thanks and believe in Him God is Allrewarding and Allforgiving
God does not love public accusation unless one is truly wronged
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Whether you act virtuously in public or in private or pardon people s faults God is Allforgiving and Allpowerful
Those who disbelieve in God and His Messengers try to create differences between God and His Messengers by rejecting their message
They say We believe in some but not in others Thus they try to find a middle way
but in fact they are unbelievers and for them We have prepared a humiliating torment
As for those who believe in God and make no distinction between His Messengers they will receive His reward
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad the People of the Book ask you to make a Book descend to them from the heavens
However they had asked Moses for things much harder to do than this by saying Show us God in person
Thunder and lightning struck them because of their unjust demands
Despite all the evidence that had come to them they started to worship the calf but We forgave them for their sins and gave Moses clear authority
We raised Mount Sinai above them because of Our solemn promise to them Also We told them to prostrate themselves when entering the gate of the holy house and not to commit transgression on the Sabbath
We made a solemn covenant with them
However because of their disbelief disregard of their covenant denial of God s revelations murdering the Prophets without reason and their saying that their hearts were covered We sealed up their hearts
Only a few of them believe
Their hearts were also sealed because of their lack of faith their gravely slanderous accusation against Mary
and their statement that they murdered Jesus son of Mary the Messenger of God when in fact they could not have murdered him or crucified him
They in fact murdered someone else by mistake
Even those who disputed the question of whether or not Jesus was murdered did not have a shred of evidence
All that they knew about it was mere conjecture
They certainly could not have murdered Jesus
God raised him up to Himself
God is Majestic and Allwise
There will be no one among the People of the Book who will not believe a belief of no value in him Jesus before their deaths On the Day of Judgment Jesus will testify against them
We made unlawful for the Jews certain pure things which had been lawful for them before because of the injustice which they had committed their obstructing many people from the way of God
their taking usury which was prohibited for them and their consuming people s property unjustly
For the unbelievers among them We have prepared a painful torment
However the learned among them the Jews and the faithful believe in what God has revealed to you Muhammad and to the others before you and those who are steadfast in prayer pay their religious tax and believe in God and the Day of Judgment
They all will receive a great reward from Us
Muhammad We have sent revelations to you just as were sent to Noah and the Prophets who lived after him and to Abraham Ishmael Isaac Jacob his descendants Jesus Job Jonah Aaron and Solomon
We gave the Psalms to David
We sent revelations to the Messengers mentioned to you before and also to Messengers who have not been mentioned to you
God spoke to Moses in words
The Messengers were sent to give people the glad news of God s mercy and warn them of His punishment so that the human being would not have any objections against God after the coming of the Messengers that they did not have any knowledge of His mercy and punishment
God is Majestic and Allwise
God testifies that whatever He has revealed to you Muhammad He has revealed it on purpose and the angels also testify to it but God s testimony alone is Sufficient
Those who have rejected the faith and have obstructed people from the way of God have certainly gone far away from the right path
God will not forgive those who have rejected the faith and committed injustice nor will He guide them to any way
other than that of hell wherein they will live forever
For God this is not in the least bit difficult
Mankind the Messenger has come to you from your Lord in all Truth It is for your own good to believe in him but if you disbelieve know that to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth God is Allknowing and Allwise
People of the Book do not exceed the limits of devotion in your religion or say anything about God which is not the Truth
Jesus son of Mary is only a Messenger of God His Word and a spirit from Him whom He conveyed to Mary
So have faith in God and His Messengers
Do not say that there are three gods
It is better for you to stop believing in the Trinity
There is only One God
He is too glorious to give birth to a son
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God alone is a Sufficient Guardian for all
Jesus never disdained the worship of God nor did the nearest angels to God
Whoever out of pride disdains the worship of God should know that everyone will be brought before Him
The righteously striving believers will receive the reward for their deeds and extra favors from God
But those who disdain the worship of God out of pride will suffer the most painful torment
They will find no guardian or helper besides God
Mankind an undeniable proof has certainly come to you and We have sent you a shining light
Those who believe in God and seek His protection will receive His mercy favors and His guidance to the right path
Muhammad they seek your verdict
Tell them God commands this concerning your kindred If a man dies childless but has a sister she will receive half of the legacy
If a woman dies childless her brother will receive the whole legacy
If a childless man leaves only two sisters both will receive twothirds of the legacy
If the heirs are both sisters and brothers the share of a male will be twice as much as the share of the female
God explains His Laws to you so that you will not go astray
God knows all things
Believers stand by your contracts and obligations
Of all animals cattle has been made lawful for you as food with certain exceptions Hunting is not lawful for you during ihram a part of the rituals during pilgrimage
God decrees as He wills
Believers do not disrespect the reminders of God the sacred months the animals brought for sacrifice or what is marked for sacrificial offering or the people heading to the precinct of the Sacred House to seek the favor and pleasure of their Lord
Once the restrictions of ihram are over you may hunt
Do not let the hostility of a group of people keep you away from the Sacred Mosque or make you express animosity
Cooperate with each other in righteousness and piety not in sin and hostility
Have fear of God He is stern in His retribution
It is unlawful for you to consume the following as food an animal that has not been properly slaughtered blood pork an animal slaughtered and consecrated in the name of someone other than God an animal killed by strangulation or a violent blow an animal killed by falling down an animal which has been gored to death an animal partly eaten by a wild beast before being properly slaughtered an animal which has been sacrificed on the stone blocks which pagans worshipped and any flesh divided by casting superstitious and gambling arrows a pagan tradition which is a sin
Today the unbelievers have lost hope about your religion
Do not be afraid of them but have fear of Me
On this day I have perfected your religion completed My favors to you and have chosen Islam as your religion
If anyone not normally inclined to sin is forced by hunger to eat unlawful substances instead of proper food he may do so to spare his life
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad they ask you what has been made lawful for them as food
Tell them All pure things are made lawful for you
If you train dogs or other beasts for hunting you should train them according to what God has taught you
It then is lawful for you to eat the animals that they hunt provided you mention the Name of God over the prey
Have fear of God
Certainly God s reckoning is swift
On this day all pure things are made lawful for you as food
The food of the People of the Book is made lawful for you and your food is made lawful for them
It is lawful for you to marry chaste Muslim women and chaste women of the People of the Book provided you pay their dowry maintain chastity and avoid fornication or lustful relations outside of marriage The deeds of anyone who rejects the faith certainly become fruitless
He will be of those who lose on the Day of Judgment
Believers when you are about to pray wash your face and your hands along with the elbows and wipe your head and your feet to the ankles
If you experience a seminal discharge manage to take the required bath
If you are sick or on a journey or have just defecated or have had intercourse with women and cannot find any water perform a tayammum by touching clean natural earth with both palms and wiping the upper part of your face and the back of your hands God does not want you to suffer hardship
He wants you to be purified He wants to complete His favors to you so that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Remember God s favors to you and the firm covenant that He has made with you You said because of this covenant We have heard the words of the Lord and have obeyed Him
Have fear of God He knows well all that the hearts contain
Believers be steadfast for the cause of God and just in bearing witness
Let not a group s hostility to you cause you to deviate from justice
Be just for it is closer to piety
Have fear of God God is Well Aware of what you do
God has promised forgiveness and a great reward to the righteously striving believers
However the unbelievers who have called Our revelations lies will have hell for their dwelling
Believers recall God s favors to you when a group of people were about to harm you and God made their evil plots against you fail
Have fear of God
Believers only trust in God
God certainly made a solemn covenant with the children of Israel and raised among them twelve elders
God said to them I am with you if you will be steadfast in your prayers pay zakat religious tax believe in My Messengers support them with reverence and give a generous loan for the cause of God We shall expiate your bad deeds and admit you to the gardens wherein streams flow
Whichever of you turns to disbelief after this has certainly gone astray from the right path
For their disregard of their solemn covenant with God We condemned the Israelites and made their hearts hard as stone Now they displace the words of God and have forgotten their share of the guidance that they had received
Still you receive news of the treachery of all but a few of them
Forgive and ignore them
God loves the righteous ones
We had made a solemn covenant with those who call themselves Christians but they forgot their share of the guidance that was sent to them
We have induced hatred and animosity among them which will remain with them until the Day of Judgment when God will tell them about what they had done
People of the Book Our Messenger has come to you He tells you about the many things that you had been hiding of the Book and forgives you much
A light and a clarifying Book has come to you from God
to show the way of peace to those who seek His pleasure to bring them out of darkness into light through His will and to guide them to the right path
Those who have said that the Messiah son of Mary is God have in fact committed themselves to disbelief
Muhammad ask them Who can prevent God from destroying the Messiah his mother and all that is in the earth
To God belongs all that is in the heavens the earth and all that is between them
God creates whatever He wants and He has power over all things
The Jews and Christians call themselves the beloved sons of God
Muhammad ask them Why does God punish you for your sins
In fact you are mere human beings whom He has created
He forgives and punishes whomever He wants
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens the earth and all that is between them and to Him do all things return
People of the Book Our Messenger has come to you to guide you at a time when none of Our other Messengers are living among you We sent him so that you will not complain about having no one to tell you of what is good or warn you of what is bad
Now a bearer of good news has come to you
God has power over all things
When Moses told his people Recall God s favors to you He made Messengers and Kings out of your own people and gave you what He had not given to others
Enter the sacred promised land which God has designated for you Do not return to disbelief lest you become lost
They said Moses a giant race of people is living there
We shall never go there unless they leave the land first
If they leave it then we will enter
Two Godfearing men on whom God had bestowed favors told them Proceed through the gates and when you enter the city you will be victorious
Have trust in God if you are true believers
They said Moses as long as they are in the land we shall never go there
Go with your Lord to fight them but we shall stay where we are
Moses said Lord I can only speak for myself and my brother keep us away from the evildoers
The Lord said The land will be prohibited to them for forty years during all such time they will wander in the land
Do not feel sad for the evildoing people
Muhammad tell them the true story of the two sons of Adam Abel and Cain
Each one of them offered a sacrifice God accepted the sacrifice of one of them Abel but not that of the other Cain who then said to his brother I shall certainly kill you
Abel replied God only accepts the offerings of the pious ones
Even if you try to kill me I certainly shall not try to kill you
I have fear of God the Lord of the creation
I would prefer you to take sole responsibility for both our sins and thus become a dweller of hell this is what an unjust person deserves
Cain s soul prompted him to kill his own brother In doing so he became of those who lose
God sent down a raven which started to dig up the earth to show the killer how to bury the corpse of his brother
On seeing the raven Cain said Woe to me
Am I less able than a raven to bury the corpse of my brother
He became greatly remorseful
For this reason We made it a law for the children of Israel that the killing of a person for reasons other than legal retaliation or for stopping corruption in the land is as great a sin as murdering all of mankind
However to save a life would be as great a virtue as to save all of mankind
Our Messengers had come to them with clear authoritative evidence but many of them Israelites thereafter started doing wrong in the land
The only proper recompense for those who fight against God and His Messenger and try to spread evil in the land is to be killed crucified or either to have one of their hands and feet cut from the opposite side or to be sent into exile
These are to disgrace them in this life and they will suffer a great torment in the life hereafter
As for those who repent before you the legal authorities have control over them by proving their guilts
They should know that God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers have fear of God
Find the means to reach Him and strive hard for His cause so that you may have everlasting happiness
Had the unbelievers had twice as much as the wealth of the whole earth in order to ransom themselves from the torment in the life hereafter still their ransom would not have been accepted
For them there will be a painful torment
They will wish to get out of the fire but they will not have such a choice
Their torment will be constant
Cut off the hands of a male or female thief as a punishment for their deed and a lesson for them from God
God is Majestic and Allwise
However God will accept the repentance of whoever repents and reforms himself after committing injustice He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Do you not know that to God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and that He punishes or forgives whomever He wants
God has power over all things
Messenger do not be grieved about the people who run back to disbelief They only say that they believe but in fact they have no faith in their hearts
Some Jews knowingly listen to lies and accept the lies which come from others Jews who have no relation with you and who distort certain words of the Bible and say to the people Accept only those words which are the same as what We have told you
If you do not then beware You can not help those whom God wants to try
God does not want to cleanse the hearts of such people
They lead a disgraceful life in this world and in the life hereafter they will suffer a great torment
They deliberately listen to lies for deceitful purposes and live on usury
If they come to you seeking your judgment to settle their differences you may settle their disputes or keep aloof from them
Should you choose not to bother with them it will not harm you in the least
If you decide to issue your decree decide their case with justice
God loves those who are just
How can they come to you for judgment when they already have the Torah which contains the decree of God It does not take them long to disregard your judgment they are not true believers
We had revealed the Torah containing guidance and light
The Prophets who had submitted themselves to the will of God judged the Jews by the laws of the Torah
So did the godly people and the Jewish scholars who remembered some parts of the Book of God and bore witness to it
Mankind do not be afraid of people but have fear of Me
Do not sell My revelations for a paltry price
Those who do not judge by the laws of God are disbelievers
In the Torah We made mandatory for the Jews these rules of retaliation Capital punishment for the murder of a person an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and a just compensation for a wound
If the perpetrator is forgiven by the affected party this will be an expiation of his crime
Those who do not judge according to what God has revealed are unjust
We made Jesus son of Mary follow in the footsteps of the earlier Prophets and confirm what existed in the Torah in his time
We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light as a confirmation of the Torah and instruction and advice for the pious ones
The followers of the Gospels the New Testament must judge according to what God has revealed in it
Those who do not judge by the laws of God are evil doers
We have revealed the Book to you Muhammad in all Truth It confirms the original Bible and has the authority to preserve or abrogate what the Bible contains
Judge among them by what God has revealed to you and do not follow their desires instead of the Truth which has come to you
We have given a law and a way of life to each of you
Had God wanted He could have made you into one nation but He wanted to see who are the more pious ones among you
Compete with each other in righteousness
All of you will return to God who will tell you the truth in the matter of your differences
Muhammad you must judge among them by what God has revealed
Do not follow their desires
Beware of their mischievous deception concerning some of the matters that God has revealed to you
If they turn away know that what God wants is to punish them for some of their sins
Many human beings are evildoers
Do they want judgments that are issued out of ignorance
Who is a better judge for the people whose belief is based on certainty than God
Believers do not consider the Jews and Christians as your intimate friends for they are only friends with each other
Whoever does so will be considered as one of them
God does not guide the unjust people
Muhammad you have seen those whose hearts are sick running around among the people Jews saying We are afraid of being struck by disaster
But if God were to grant you victory or some other favors they would then regret for what they had been hiding in their souls
The believers say Are these the people who proclaimed themselves to be our sworn friends
Their deeds have become devoid of all virtue and they themselves have become lost
Believers whichever of you turns away from his faith should know that God will soon raise a people whom He loves and who love Him who are humble towards the believers dignified to the unbelievers who strive hard for the cause of God and who have no fear of anyone s accusations This is a favor from God
He bestows His favors upon whomever He wants
God is Munificent and Allknowing
Only God His Messenger and the true believers who are steadfast in prayer and pay alms while they kneel during prayer are your guardians
One whose guardians are God His Messenger and the true believers should know that God s party will certainly triumph
Believers do not consider those among the People of the Book and the unbelievers who mock at your religion and treat it as useless as your protectors
Have fear of God if you are true believers
Because they are devoid of understanding they ridicule your call for prayers saying that it is a useless act
Muhammad say to the People of the Book Do you take revenge on us because of our belief in God and what He has revealed to us and to others before us Most of you are evildoers
Say Should I tell you who will receive the worst punishment from God
Those whom God has condemned afflicted with His anger made apes out of them swine and worshippers of Satan will have the worst dwelling and will wander far away from the right path
When they come to you believers they say We have accepted your faith
However they entered into your faith as unbelievers and left it as unbelievers
God knows best what they were hiding
You can see many of them competing with each other in sin hostility and in taking usury
What they had been doing is certainly evil
Why did the men of God and rabbis not forbid them from following their sinful words and their consuming of unlawful gains
Evil was their rabbis and priests profession
The Jews have said God s hands are bound
May they themselves be handcuffed and condemned for what they have said
God s hands are free and He distributes His favors to His creatures however He wants
The rebellion and disbelief of many of them will be intensified against you because of what has been revealed to you from your Lord
We have induced hostility and hatred among them which will remain with them up until the Day of Judgment
Whenever they kindle the fire of war God extinguishes it
They try to destroy the land but God does not love the evildoers
Had the People of the Book accepted the faith and observed piety certainly We would have redeemed their bad deeds and admitted them into a blissful Paradise
Had they followed the Laws of the Old and New Testaments and what was revealed to them from their Lord they would have received Our bounties from above and below in abundance
Some of them are modest people but many of them commit the worst sins
Messenger preach what is revealed to you from your Lord
If you will not preach it would be as though you have not conveyed My message
God protects you from men
He does not guide the unbelieving people
Muhammad tell the People of the Book You have nothing unless you follow the Old and New Testaments and that which the Quran God has revealed to you
Whatever has been revealed to you Muhammad from your Lord will only increase their disbelief and rebellion against you
Do not grieve for the unbelieving people
The believers Jews Sabaeans and the Christians who believe in God and the Day of Judgment and who do what is right will have nothing to fear nor will they be grieved
We made a covenant with the Israelites and sent Messengers to them
Whenever a Messenger came to them with a message which did not suit their desires they would reject some of the Messengers and kill others
They were blind and deaf in their pride thinking themselves to be the chosen nation of God and thus safe from calamities
God forgave them but many of them out of pride again became blind and deaf
God is Well Aware of what they do
Those who say that Jesus the son of Mary is God have in fact turned to disbelief
Jesus said to the Israelites Worship God my Lord and yours
God will deprive anyone who considers anything equal to God of Paradise and his dwelling will be fire
The unjust people have no helpers
Those who say that God is the third of the Three have in fact turned to disbelief
There is no Lord but God the only One Lord
If they will not giveup such belief the disbelievers among them will suffer a painful torment
Should they not repent and ask Him for forgiveness
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Jesus the son of Mary was no more than a Messenger before whom there lived many other Messengers
His mother was a truthful woman and both of them ate earthly food
Consider how We explain the evidence of the Truth to them and see where they then turn
Muhammad say to them Do you worship things besides God which can neither harm or benefit you
It is only God who is Allhearing and Allknowing
Say to the People of the Book Do not wrongly exceed the proper limit of devotion to your religion or follow the desires of the people who have erred
They have misled many others and have themselves stayed far away from the right path
The unbelievers among the Israelites because of their disobedience and transgression were condemned by David and Jesus the son of Mary for their disobedience they were transgressors
They did not prevent each other from committing sins nor would they themselves stay away from them
Evil was what they had done
You have seen many of them establishing friendship with the unbelievers
Vile is what their souls have gained They have invoked the wrath of God upon themselves and they will live forever in torment
Had they had faith in God the Prophet and what was revealed to him they would not have been the friends of the unbelievers
However many of them are evildoers
You find Jews and pagans among the worst of the enemies of the believers
Of the nonbelievers nearest to them the believers in affection you find those who say We are Christians for among them are the priests and monks who are not proud
When they hear what is revealed to the Messenger you can see their eyes flood with tears as they learn about the Truth
They say Lord we believe in this faith
Write our names down as bearing witness to it
Why should we not believe in God and the Truth that has come to us and hope that the Lord will admit us into the company of the righteous people
Thus God has given them as their reward gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
Such will be the recompense of the righteous people
Those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations will be the dwellers of Hell
Believers do not make unlawful the pure things which God has made lawful for you
Do not transgress for God does not love the transgressors
Eat from the pure and lawful things that God has given to you
Have fear of God in Whom you believe
God will not hold you responsible for your thoughtless oaths However He will question you about your deliberate oaths
The expiation for breaking an oath is to feed ten needy people with food typical of that which you feed to your own people to clothe them or to set a slave free
One who cannot pay this he must fast for three days to expiate his oaths
Keep your oaths
Thus does God explain His Laws so that you will give Him thanks
Believers wine gambling the stone altars and arrows that the pagans associate with certain divine characters are all abominable acts associated with satanic activities
Avoid them so that you may have everlasting happiness
Satan wants to induce hostility and hatred among you through wine and gambling and to prevent you from remembering God and prayer
Will you then avoid such things
Obey God and the Messenger and be cautious of the harmful things
If you turn away from Our laws know that the duty of the Messenger is only to preach in clear words
The righteously striving believers will not be blamed for what they have eaten if they maintain piety do good deeds have faith and be charitable
God loves the generous people
Believers God will test you to see the strength of your obedience concerning what you hunt by hand or spear so that He would know who has fear of Him in private
Whoever transgresses will suffer a painful torment
Believers do not hunt when you are in the holy precinct Whichever of you purposely kills game in the holy precinct has to offer as an expiation a sacrifice in the holy precinct which two just people among you would consider equal to the prey or food to a destitute person or has to fast for an appointed time to bear the burden of the penalty for his deed God forgives whatever was done in the past but He will take revenge on whoever returns to transgression for He is Majestic and Capable of taking revenge
It is lawful for you to hunt from the sea and to eat seafood This is for your benefit and for the benefit of travellers
However it is not lawful for you to hunt on land as long as you are in the sacred precinct
Have fear of God before whom you will all be raised
God has made the Kabah the Sacred House the sacred months the unmarked and marked sacrificial animals for the welfare of men and in order to inform you that God knows all that is in the heavens and the earth He has the knowledge of all things
Know that God is stern in His retribution and He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
The duty of the Messenger is only to preach
God knows what you reveal or hide
Muhammad say to them The pure and filthy are not the same even though the abundance of filth may attract you
Men of reason have fear of God so that you may have eternal happiness
Believers do not ask about things which if revealed to you would disappoint you
If you ask about such things when the Prophet is receiving revelations they will also be revealed to you
God has exempted you from the responsibilities of the things you wanted to know
He is Allforgiving and Forbearing
People living before you had asked about such things but then rejected them
God has not instituted the rites of Bahirah Sa ibah Wasilah nor of Hami names of certain animals that the pagans would offer as sacrifice
It is the pagans who have attributed falsehood to God Many of them have no understanding
When they are told to refer to the guidance of God and to the Messenger they say The tradition of our fathers is sufficient for our guidance even though in fact their fathers had neither knowledge nor proper guidance
Believers save your own souls for if you have the right guidance no one who strays can harm you You will all return to God who will tell you about what you have done
Believers when death approaches any one of you let two just men from your own people Muslims or any two other men People of the Book if death befalls you on a journey bear witness to the bequest
If you have any doubts as to their honesty detain them and let them take an oath after the prayer each one of them saying I swear by God that my testimony is true I am not selling the Truth for a paltry price even though the beneficiary would be one of my relatives
I do not hide the testimony which is the right of God for then I would be one of the sinners
If their honesty is challenged two others from the relatives of the deceased should swear in the same way and testify to the bequest saying We swear by God that our testimony is the true one
We do not transgress in the matter lest we become unjust ones
This will help preserve a proper testimony because the witness will be afraid of the denial of their own testimony by a second pair of witness
Have fear of God and listen properly
God does not guide the evil doing people
Have fear of the day when God will bring all the Messengers together and ask them What was the response of men to your call
They will reply We have no knowledge
You are the only One who has knowledge of the unseen
When God said Jesus son of Mary recall My favors to you and your mother
Recall how I supported you by the holy spirit made you speak to people from your cradle and when you grew up taught you the Book gave you wisdom the Torah and the Gospel
Recall when by My will you made a sculpture of a bird out of clay blew into it and it turned into a real bird by My Will
Recall how by My will you healed the deaf the lepers and raised the dead
Recall when you came to the Israelites in the house with clear miracles and I saved you from their mischief even though the disbelievers among them said This is obviously magic
Recall when I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and My Messenger
They said We have accepted the faith Lord bear witness that we have submitted ourselves to Your will
Recall when the disciples said Jesus son of Mary can your Lord send us a table full of food from heaven and you replied Have fear of God if you are true believers
They said We only wish to eat therefrom to comfort our hearts to know that you have spoken the Truth to us and to bear witness to it along with the others
When Jesus prayed Lord send us a table full of food from heaven so that it will make a feast for us and for those who are yet to come in this world and an evidence from You
Give us sustenance for You are the best Provider
God replied I am sending it to you but if anyone of you turns back to disbelief I will make him suffer a torment that no one has ever suffered
When God asked Jesus son of Mary Did you tell men to consider you and your mother as their gods besides God he replied Glory be to you
How could I say what I have no right to say
Had I ever said it You would have certainly known about it
You know what is in my soul but I do not know what is in Yours
It is You who has absolute knowledge of the unseen
I did not tell them anything except what You commanded me to tell them
I told them that they must worship God who is everyone s Lord
I watched them as long as I was among them until You raised me to Yourself and You Yourself had also watched over them You are Omnipresent
You may punish Your servants or forgive them for You are Majestic and Wise
God will say This is the Day when the truthful ones will benefit from their truthfulness
For them there are gardens wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever
God is pleased with them and they will be pleased with God in their supreme triumph
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and He has power over all things
Only God Who has created the heavens the earth darkness and light deserves all praise
The disbelievers consider other things equal to Him
It is He who has created you from clay to live for a lifetime and the span of your life is only known to Him
You are still suspicious
He is God of the heavens and the earth and He knows whatever you conceal reveal or gain
The unbelievers have always turned away from the revelations and the evidence of the Truth that has been sent to them from time to time
They have refused the Truth Muhammad s message that has come to them but they will soon learn the consequences of their mocking
Why do they not consider how many generations living before them We have destroyed
We established those nations in the land with abilities far beyond those given to you
We sent down plenty of rain from the sky for them and made streams flow therein but then We destroyed them for their sins and established other nations after them
Muhammad had We sent you a Book on paper the unbelievers would have touched it with their hands but would still have said It is no more than plain sorcery
They have said Why has not an angel come to him Muhammad
Had We sent an angel to them the matter would have inevitably been out of their hands and they would have been given no more time
Were We to have made him Our Messenger an angel We would have made him resemble a human being and they would have again complained that the matter was as confusing to them as it is to them now
They mocked the Messengers who lived before you Muhammad but those who received warnings of punishment and mocked the warnings all suffered their torments accordingly
Muhammad tell them to travel in the land and see what happened to those who rejected the Truth
Ask them Who is the owner of the heavens and the earth besides God the Allmerciful who will gather you all together on the Day of Judgment
That day will certainly come
Those who have lost their souls will not believe
To Him belongs all that rests during the night and the day
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Muhammad ask them Should I take a guardian other than God the Originator of the heavens and the earth who feeds everyone and who needs no food Himself
Say I have been commanded to be the first Muslim submitted to the will of God Thus people do not be pagans
Muhammad say Because of the torment of the Great Day I am afraid to disobey my Lord
One who will be saved from the torment on the Day of Judgment will certainly have received God s mercy and this will be a manifest triumph
Muhammad if God afflicts you with hardship no one besides Him will be able to relieve you
If He bestows a favor on you know that He has power over all things
He is Wise Well Aware and Dominant over all His creatures
Muhammad ask them What is the greatest testimony
God testifies of my truthfulness to you
He has revealed this Quran to me to warn you and the coming generations against disobeying God
Do you believe that other gods exist besides God
I solemnly declare that He is the only Lord and that I am not guilty of believing in what the pagans believe
The People of the Book know him Muhammad just as well as they know their own children but those who have lost their souls will not believe
Who are more unjust than those who ascribe falsehood to God or reject His revelations
The unjust will certainly have no happiness
On the Day of Judgment when We will gather all people together We will ask the pagans Where are those whom you believed to be your gods
Attempting to answer they will say Lord we swear by Your Name that we were not pagans
Consider how they have lied against their own souls and have lost their gods
Some of them listen to you but We have veiled their hearts so that they cannot understand and made them deaf
They disbelieve all the evidence of Our existence that they may have seen
They only come to you for the sake of argument and the disbelievers say that whatever Muhammad says is no more than ancient legends
They keep away from the faith and forbid others to accept it
They destroy no one except themselves yet they do not realize it
If only you could see them standing in the fire saying Would that we could return to the worldly life We would never reject any of our Lord s revelations and we would be true believers
Whatever they had concealed will be revealed to them
If they were to return to the worldly life they would again worship idols for they are liars
They have said that this life is the only life and that there will be no Resurrection
Would that you could see them standing before their Lord who would ask them Is not the Resurrection true
They would reply Yes Lord there is a Resurrection
The Lord would then say For your disbelief suffer the torment
Those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment have incurred upon themselves a great loss
When the Day of Judgment suddenly comes upon them they will sink under the burden of their sins in grief for their neglecting that day
Terrible indeed will be their burden
The worldly life is but useless amusement and sport compared to the life hereafter which is far better and is only for the pious
Will you not then understand
We certainly know that you Muhammad are sad about what they the unbelievers say
It is not you alone who has been accused of lying
The unjust have always rejected God s revelations
The Messengers who lived before you were also accused of lying but they exercised patience
They were cruelly persecuted before We gave them victory No one can change the words of God
You have already received news about the Messengers
Muhammad if their refusal of the faith is so grievous to you and if you can dig up the earth or ascend into the sky in search of further evidence to inevitably make them believe you you should have done so but note that had God wanted He could have made them all follow the same guidance
Do not ever be unaware of this fact
Only those who have understanding will accept your faith
Those who have no understanding are like the dead whom God will resurrect and to Him will all return
They say Why have not some miracles been given to him Muhammad from his Lord
Tell them Muhammad God certainly has the Power to show such miracles but many of them are ignorant
All the beasts on land and flying birds have different communities just as you people do
Nothing is left without a mention in the Book
They will all be brought into the presence of their Lord
Those who disbelieve Our revelations are in fact deaf and dumb They wander in darkness
God leads astray or guides to the right path whomever He wants
Muhammad say to them Should God afflict you with torment or should the Day of Judgment arrive if what you claim is true could you then seek help from any one other than God
You will certainly ask Him for help
He will save you from hardship if He decides to do so and you will forget all about your gods
We had sent Our guidance to the nations who lived before you and afflicted them with distress and adversity so that they might submit themselves to God
Why did they not submit themselves to God when Our torment struck them
Instead their hearts were hardened and Satan made their evil deeds seem attractive to them
When they forgot all the advice that they had received We granted them all means of happiness but they were left in despair when We suddenly took Our bounties back from them
Thus the transgressing people were destroyed
It is only God the Lord of creation who deserves all praise
Muhammad ask them Have you ever considered that if God was to disable your hearing and vision and veil your hearts could anyone besides Him restore them
Look at how plainly We show them the evidence of the Truth but they always ignore it
Tell them Have you considered that if God s torment was to befall you suddenly or in public would anyone else be destroyed except the unjust
We did not send the Messengers for any other reason than to bring people the glad news of God s mercy and to warn them of the torment brought on by disobedience to God
Whoever accepts the faith and lives a righteous life will have nothing to fear nor will he be grieved
Those who reject Our revelations will certainly be punished for their evil deeds
Muhammad tell them I do not claim to have all the treasures of God in my hands nor to know the unseen nor do I claim to be an angel
I follow only what is revealed to me from God
Say to them Are the blind and the seeing equal
Why then do you not think
Preach the Quran to those who are concerned about the Day of Judgment at which time they will be brought before their Lord
Tell them that their only guardian and intercessor is God so that they may become pious
Do not disregard those who pray to their Lord in the mornings and evenings seeking their Lord s pleasure
You will not be held responsible for them nor will they be held responsible for you
Do not disregard them lest you become unjust
We test some of them by the conditions of the others so that the rich and proud ones seeing your poor and humble followers would say Are these the ones from among all of us whom God has chosen to favor
Does not God know those who give thanks much better than others do
When the faithful come to you say to them Peace be upon you
Your Lord has decreed for Himself to be Allmerciful Anyone of you who commits a sin out of ignorance then repents and reforms himself will find that God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Thus do We explain Our revelations so that the sinful way can be plainly discerned
Muhammad tell them I am commanded not to worship the idols instead of God
I do not follow your desires lest I go astray and miss the true guidance
Say I have received enough authoritative evidence from my Lord but you have rejected it
Whatever torment that God has threatened you with for your disbelief and that which you insist on to experience without delay is not in my hands
The final Judgment is in the hands of God
He reveals the Truth and He is the best Judge
Say If I had in my hands what you demand to experience without delay the matter would have been ended all together God knows best about the unjust
He has with Him the keys to the unseen which no one knows besides Him
He knows all that is in the land and the sea
Not a single leaf falls which He would not know
No single seed exists even in the darkest places of the land nor anything in the world either wet or dry that is not kept recorded in the selfevident Book the tablet preserved in the heavens
It is He who keeps you alive in your sleep at night and knows all that you do during the day
He wakes you up from your sleep to complete your worldly life after which you will all return to Him
He will let you know all about what you had done in your worldly life
He is Dominant over all His creatures and He sends guards to watch over you until death approaches you
Then His angelic Messengers will without fail take away your souls
After death you will all be returned to God your true Guardian
Know that judgment will be in His Hands and that His reckoning is swift
Muhammad ask them Who would save you from the darkness of the land and sea if you were to pray humbly and secretly saying Would that we were saved from this for we would certainly then give thanks
Say It is God who always saves you from such hardship and from all kinds of distress
Even then you consider idols equal to God
Say God has the power to send torment on you from above or below your feet or to divide you into different groups quite hostile to one another and make you suffer from each other s animosity
Consider how plainly We show them a variety of evidence of the Truth so that they may have understanding
Some of your people have rejected the Quran although it is the Truth
Tell them that you are not their guardian
and that for every prophecy about you which comes from God there is an appointed time to come true and that they will soon experience it
When you see people mocking Our revelations turn away from them so that they may change the subject
If Satan causes you to forget this do not sit with the unjust people when you remember
But those who observe piety commit no sin by sitting with the unbelievers in order to preach the Truth so that they too may become pious
Muhammad leave alone those to whom their religion is no more than a useless plaything and who are deceived by the lure of the worldly life
Remind them of Our revelation so that a soul will not bring about its own destruction because of its deeds
No one besides God will be its guardian or intercessor nor will any kind of ransom be accepted from it
Those who have entangled themselves in their evil deeds will drink boiling water and live in painful torment for their hiding the Truth
Say to them Should we instead of asking for God s help seek help from that which can neither benefit nor harm us but would only turn us back to disbelief after God had granted us guidance To do so would be to act like those who have been seduced by Satan leaving them wandering aimlessly here and there even though their friends call them Come to the right guidance that has come to us
Say God s guidance is the only true guidance and we are commanded to submit ourselves to the Lord of the Universe
Be steadfast in prayer and have fear of God before Him alone you will all be brought together
It is He Who has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
When He commands the Day of Judgment to take place it will come into existence
His Word is the Truth
The kingdom will be His alone on the day when the trumpet will be sounded
He has all knowledge of the unseen as well as the seen
He is Allwise and Allaware
Consider when Abraham asked his father Azar Why do you believe idols to be your gods
I find you and your people in absolute error
Also We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth to strengthen his faith
When it became dark at night he Abraham saw a star and said This is my lord
But when it disappeared he said I do not love those who fade away
When Abraham saw the rising moon he said This is my lord
But when it faded away he said If my Lord does not guide me I shall certainly go astray
When he saw the rising sun he said This is my Lord for it is greater than the others
But when this too faded away Abraham said My people I disavow whatever you consider equal to God
I have uprightly submitted myself to the One who has created the heavens and the earth and I am not an idol worshipper
In an argument with his people Abraham asked them Why do you argue with me about God who has given me guidance
Your idols can do no harm to me unless God wills
God knows all things
Why then do you not consider this
Why should I be afraid of your idols when you are not afraid of worshipping them without any authority from heaven
Would that you knew which of us is more deserving to receive amnesty
Those who have accepted the faith and have kept it pure from injustice have achieved security and guidance
Such was the authoritative reasoning that We gave Abraham over his people
We raise whomever We want to a higher rank
Your Lord is Allwise and Allknowing
We gave Abraham Isaac and Jacob
Both had received Our guidance
Noah received Our guidance before Abraham and so did his descendants David Solomon Job Joseph Moses and Aaron
Thus is the reward for the righteous people
We also gave guidance to Zacharias John Jesus and Elias who were all pious people
and Ishmael Elisha Jonah and Lot whom We exalted over all people
From their fathers descendants and brothers We chose certain people and guided them to the right path
Such is the guidance of God by which He guides whichever of His servants He wants
If people worship idols their deeds will be turned devoid of all virtue
These were the people to whom We gave the Book Authority and Prophesy
If some people do not accept Our guidance it should not grieve you Muhammad for We have made others who accept and protect Our guidance
We had guided the Prophets
Muhammad follow their guidance and say to the people I do not ask any reward for what I have preached to you
It is my duty to awaken the world
They have no true respect of God when they say God has not sent anything to a mortal being
Muhammad tell them Who revealed the Book containing a light and guidance for the people which Moses brought
You wrote down only some parts of the original on paper and hid much even after having learnt from it that which neither you nor your fathers knew
Tell them God has revealed the Quran and then leave them alone to pursue their useless investigations
We have blessed this Book the Quran and revealed it to confirm that which was revealed to the Prophets who lived before you and to warn the people of the mother land Mecca and those living around it
Those who believe in the Day of Judgment accept this and are steadfast in their prayers
Who are more unjust than those who ascribe lies to God or say that God has sent them revelations when nothing has been sent to them or those who say that they can also bring down from heaven a book like that which God has revealed
Would that you could see the unjust in the agonies of death when the angels will come forward with their hands outstretched to take their souls out of their bodies and say This is the day when you will face humiliating torment for the falsehood that you ascribed to God and for your contemptuously disregarding of His revelations
God will say You have come to Us alone just as We created you at first You have left behind all those whom We made your friends and We do not see with you any of the intercessors whom you believed to be your partners
Your relations with them have certainly been destroyed and your belief in them has left you in the dark
It is God who makes all kinds of seeds grow brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living
It is God who does such things so how can you turn away from Him
It is He who kindles the light of dawn and has made the night for you to rest and the sun and moon as a means of calculation
This is the design of the Majestic and Allknowing God
It is God who created the stars so that you could find your way thereby in the darkness of the land and sea
We have explained Our evidence to the people of knowledge
It is He who has created you from a single soul
Some of you are settled on earth and some are still in the depository system of their parents
We have shown the evidence of Our existence to the people who understand
It is He who has sent water down from the sky to let all kinds of plants grow the vegetables with accumulated grains palmtrees from which appear clusters of dates within easy reach vineyards olive groves and pomegranates of all types
See the fruits when they are growing and when they are ripe
This too is evidence of the existence of God for those who believe
Some people considered the jinn to be equal to God even though God created them and they unknowingly ascribed to Him children both boys and girls
God is too glorious to have the attributes which they ascribe to Him
How could the One Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth and who has no companion have a son
He created all things and has absolute knowledge of all things
He is God your Lord
There is no God but He
He has created all things
Worship Him for He is the Guardian of all things
No mortal eyes can see Him but He can see all eyes
He is Allkind and Allaware
Muhammad tell them Clear proofs have certainly come to you from your Lord
Whoever tries to understand it will gain much but those who ignore it will only harm themselves
I am not supposed to watch over you all the time
Thus do We explain Our revelations to them Let them say You have learned those statements from other people
We want to explain Our revelations only to those who have knowledge
Muhammad follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord there is no God but He and stay away from pagans
Had God wanted they would not consider anything equal to Him
God has not appointed you to watch over them nor are you their guardian
Believers do not say bad words against the idols lest they pagans in their hostility and ignorance say such words against God
We have made every nation s deeds seem attractive to them
One day they will all return to their Lord who will inform them of all that they have done
The unbelievers solemnly swear by God that if they were to be shown some miracle they would certainly believe
Muhammad tell them Only with God are all the miracles
Even if a miracle was to take place they still would not believe
We will turn their hearts and vision away from a miracle they did not have faith in miracles at the first time and We will leave them blind in their rebellion
Had We sent the angels to them made the dead speak to them and resurrected all things before their very eyes they still would not believe unless God willed it to be so
But in fact most of them ignore the evidence
We have made devilish enemies for every Prophet from among people and jinn
They whisper attractive but and deceitful words to each other
Had your Lord wanted the devils would not have seduced people
Keep away from them and the falsehood which they invent
Let those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment listen to the deceitful words with pleasure and indulge in whatever sins they want
Muhammad say Should I seek any judge other than God It is He Who has revealed this Book Quran to you with all its intricate details
Those to whom We have given the Bible know that the Quran has been revealed to you from your Lord in all Truth
Thus you people must have no doubts about it
After having revealed the Quran to you in all truth and justice your Lord s Word has been completed
No one can change His Words
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Most of the people in the land will lead you away from God s guidance if you follow them they only follow their own conjecture and preach falsehood
Your Lord knows best those who have gone astray from His path and those who are rightly guided
If you have faith in God s revelations eat the flesh of the animal which has been slaughtered with a mention of His Name
Why should you not eat such flesh when God has told you in detail what is unlawful to eat under normal conditions
Most people out of ignorance are led astray by their desires
Your Lord knows best those who transgress
Stay away from both public and secret sins for a sinner will suffer for whatever he has committed
Do not eat the flesh of an animal which has been slaughtered without a mention of the Name of God it is a sinful deed
Satan teaches his friends to argue with you
If you obey them you will certainly be idol worshippers
Can the dead to whom We have given life and light so that they may walk among the people be considered equal to those who can never come out of darkness
The deeds of the unbelievers are made to seem attractive to them
In every town We have placed some sinful leaders who always make evil plans
These plans will only work against their own souls but they do not realize this
When a miracle is shown to them they say We will not believe unless we are shown a miracle like that shown to the messengers of God
God knows best whom to appoint as His Messenger
The sinful ones are worthless in the sight of God and they deserve a severe punishment for their evil plans
God will open the hearts of whomever He wants to guide to Islam but He will tighten the chest of one whom He has led astray as though he was climbing high up into the sky
Thus God places wickedness on those who do not accept the faith
This is the path of your Lord and it is straight
We have explained Our revelations to those who take heed
They will live in peace with God
God protects them as a reward for their deeds He is their Guardian
On the day when every one will be resurrected and the jinn will be told that they have made many people go astray their friends from among people will say Lord we benefitted from each other until death approached us They will be told that their dwelling will be fire wherein they will live forever unless God wills it to be otherwise Your Lord is Allwise and Allknowing
Thus do We make the unjust friends of one another because of their evil deeds
When people and jinn are asked Did not Messengers from your own people come to you to convey Our revelations and to warn you of the Day of Resurrection
They will reply Yes indeed
The worldly life deceived them
They will testify that they were unbelievers
Your Lord did not want to destroy the towns unjustly without informing their inhabitants of His guidance
People s deeds are of different degrees and your Lord is not unaware of what people do
Your Lord is Selfsufficient and Merciful
Had He wanted He could have destroyed you and replaced you by other people just as He had created you from the offspring of others
Whatever you are promised will inevitably come true and you can do nothing to prevent it
Muhammad tell your people I shall do whatever I can and you may do whatever you want but you will soon know who will be victorious It is certain that the unjust will never have happiness
They set aside a share of the leftovers of their farming produce and cattle saying This is for God and that is for the idols
God does not receive the share of the idols but the share of God is given totally to the idols
How terrible is their decision
To many of the pagans the murder of their children was made to seem attractive by the idols This led them the pagans to confusion in their religion and to face their own destruction
Had God wanted they would not have murdered their children
Keep away from them and their evil gains
They the pagans have said that their cattle and farms are dedicated to private idols and that no one can consume the produce except those whom We wanted in their opinion
They prohibited the riding of certain animals and they ate the flesh of certain animals slaughtered without a mention of the Name of God
Instead they ascribed falsehood to Him
They will all be given an evil recompense for their sinful invention
They have also said Whatever exists in the wombs of these animals belongs to our people alone and it is not lawful for our women
However if they are born dead then everyone will have a share
God will give them what they deserve for their unjust laws
God is Allmerciful and Allknowing
Those who foolishly and ignorantly murdered their children ascribed falsehood to God and made unlawful what He had given to them for their sustenance have certainly lost much
They had gone far away from the right guidance
It is He who has created all kinds of gardens those raised on trellises and those without palmtrees and the crops of different seasons and olives and pomegranates of all types
You may eat their fruits that they produce but pay God s share on the harvest day Do not be excessive for God does not love those who are excessive
God has created animals both small and large
Eat from what God has given you for your sustenance and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan
He is your sworn enemy
Supposing that there are eight pairs of cattle two pairs of sheep and two pairs of goats
Tell Me which is lawful and which is not
Are the two males unlawful to eat or the two females or those that are in the wombs of the females If you are truthful then answer Me exactly
Of the two pairs of camels and cows are the males unlawful to eat or the females or that which exists in the wombs of the females
Were you present when God commanded you to do this
Who are more unjust than those who ascribe falsehood to God and out of ignorance make others go astray
God does not guide the unjust
Muhammad tell them I do not find anything which has been made unlawful to eat in what has been revealed to me except carrion blood flowing from the body pork for pork is absolutely filthy and the flesh of the animals slaughtered without the mention of the name of God
However in an emergency when one does not have any intention of rebelling or transgressing against the law your Lord will be Allforgiving and Allmerciful
We made unlawful for the Jews all the clawfooted animals fat of the cows sheep and goats except what is found on their backs intestines and whatever is mixed with their bones
Thus did We recompense them for their rebellion and We are certainly truthful
They reject you Muhammad tell them Your Lord s mercy is completely overwhelming but no one can save the sinful from His wrath
The pagans will say Had God wanted we would not have worshipped idols nor would our fathers nor would we have made anything unlawful
Others before them had also spoken such lies until they experienced the severity of Our wrath
Muhammad ask them Do you possess any knowledge If so tell us about it
You follow only conjectures and preach falsehood
Say Final authority belongs only to God
Had He wanted He would have given you all guidance
Ask them to call their witness who will testify that God has made certain things unlawful
Even if they do testify do not testify with them Do not follow the desires of those who have rejected Our revelations and the pagans who do not believe in the Day of Judgment
Muhammad say Let me tell you about what your Lord has commanded Do not consider anything equal to God Be kind to your parents Do not murder your children out of fear of poverty for We give sustenance to you and to them
Do not even approach indecency either in public or in private
Take not a life which God has made sacred except by way of justice and law
Thus does He command you that you may learn wisdom
Do not handle the property of the orphans except with a good reason until they become mature and strong
Maintain equality in your dealings by the means of measurement and balance
No soul is responsible for what is beyond it s ability
Be just in your words even if the party involved is one of your relatives and keep your promise with God
Thus does your Lord guide you so that you may take heed
This is My path and it is straight
Follow it and not other paths which will lead you far away from the path of God
Thus does God guide you so that you may become pious
We gave Moses the Book to complete Our favor for the righteous ones the Book that contained a detailed explanation of all things a guide and a mercy so that perhaps they would have faith in the Day of Judgment
This Book Quran which We have revealed is a blessed one
Follow its guidance and have piety so that you perhaps may receive mercy
and will not say that the Book was revealed only to two groups of people before you or that you were ignorant of its knowledge
or proclaim Had the Book been revealed to us we would have followed its guidance better than the Jews and Christians
Evidence guidance and mercy have already come to you from your Lord
Who are more unjust than those who reject God s revelations and turn away from them
We will give an evil recompense to those who turn away from Our revelations and a terrible torment for their disregard of Our guidance
Are they waiting until the angels or your Lord come to them or for some miracles to take place
On the day when some miracles of God will take place the belief of any soul will be of no avail to it unless some good deeds have been done with it or it has been formed before the coming of such a day
Muhammad tell them Wait and we too are waiting
Some of those who have divided their religion into different sects are not your concern
Their affairs are in the hands of God Who will show them all that they have done
For a single good deed one will be rewarded tenfold
But the recompense for a bad deed will be equal to that of the deed and no injustice will be done to anyone
Muhammad tell them My Lord has guided me to the right path a well established religion and the upright tradition of Abraham who was not a pagan
Say My prayer sacrifice life and death are all for God the Lord of the Universe
Nothing is equal to Him
Thus are the commandments which I have received and he is the first Muslim submitted to the will of God
Muhammad tell them Should I take a lord besides God when He is the Lord of all things
All one s evil deeds are against one s own soul
No one will be considered responsible for another s sins
You will all be returned to your Lord who will tell you what is right and wrong in disputed matters among you
On earth We have made each of your generations the successors of their predecessors We have made some of you do good deeds of a higher degree than others
He will test you in this way through what He has revealed to you Your Lord s retribution is swift and He is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Alif Lam
A book has been revealed to you Muhammad
You should not hesitate to convey its warning and its good advice to the believers
People follow whatever is revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other guardians besides Him
However you pay very little attention to Our words
How many cities have We destroyed
Our wrath struck their people at night or during their midday siesta
When Our wrath struck them they could do nothing but confess to their sins
We will certainly question the people and the Messengers sent to them
We will tell them with absolute certainty what they had done for We had never been absent from them during their lifetime
Everyone s deeds will certainly be weighed and evaluated on the Day of Judgment
Those whose good deeds weigh heavier than their bad deeds will have everlasting happiness
As for those whose bad deeds weigh heavier they will lose their souls for their injustice to Our revelations
We have made you inhabit the land and provided you with the means of sustenance
Only a few of you give thanks
We created and shaped you then told the angels to prostrate themselves before Adam
All the angels obeyed except Satan who did not
God asked What made you disobey Me
Satan replied I am better than Adam for You have created me out of fire and Adam out of clay
The Lord ordered Satan to get out of Paradise saying This is no place for you to be proud
Get out of this place for you are worthless
Satan asked the Lord to give him respite keep him alive until the Day of Resurrection
The Lord told him We will grant you this respite
Then Satan said Because you have made me go astray I shall certainly try to seduce people into straying from the right path
I shall attack them from all directions and You will not find many of them giving You thanks
The Lord told Satan Get out of this garden for you are banished and despised
Hell will be filled with all of those who follow you
Then the Lord said Adam stay in the garden with your spouse and eat whatever you want therein but do not go near this tree lest you transgress
Satan tempted them to reveal that which was kept private from them and said Your Lord has not prohibited you to eat the fruits of this tree unless you want to be angels or immortal
Satan swore before them that he was giving them good advice
Thus he deceitfully showed them the tree
When they had tasted fruits from the tree their private parts became revealed to them and they began to cover their private parts with leaves from the garden
Their Lord then called out to them saying Did I not forbid you to eat fruits from the tree and tell you that Satan was your sworn enemy
They replied Lord we have done injustice to our souls
If You will not forgive us and have mercy on us we shall certainly have incurred a great loss
The Lord told them to leave the garden as each other s enemies and go to earth to dwell and benefit from the means therein for an appointed time
He told them that on earth they would live die and be resurrected
Children of Adam We have given you clothing to cover your private parts and for beauty but the robe of piety is the best
Thus is the guidance of God so that you may take heed
Children of Adam do not let Satan seduce you as he caused your parents to be expelled from the garden and made them take off their clothes in order to show them their private parts
Satan and those like him see you but you do not see them
We have made the Satans as friends for those who have no faith
When The faithless commit indecent acts they say We found our fathers doing this and God has commanded us to do the same
Muhammad tell them that God does not command anyone to commit indecency
Do you speak for God saying things of which you have no knowledge
Say My Lord has ordered me to maintain justice
People pay due attention when worshipping God
Pray to Him sincerely and be devoted in your religion
Just as He gave you life He will bring you back to life again after you die
He has guided one group of people and the other group go is doomed to astray the latter group took Satan as their guardian instead of God and thought that they were rightly guided
Children of Adam dress well when attending the mosques eat and drink but do not be excessive for God does not love those who are excessive in what they do
Muhammad ask them Who has made it unlawful to maintain beauty and to eat the pure foods which God has created for His servants
They are made for the believers in this world and are exclusively for them in the life hereafter
Thus do We explain Our revelations to the people who have knowledge
Muhammad tell them My Lord has only prohibited indecent acts committed in public or in secret all sins unjust rebellion considering things equal to God without any heavenly authority and speaking for God without having any knowledge of what He has said
All people can only live for an appointed time When their term ends they will not remain alive even for a single hour nor will they die before the appointed time
Children of Adam when Messengers from among your own people come to you to preach My revelations those who choose piety and reform themselves will have nothing to fear nor will they be grieved
But those who have rejected Our revelations out of pride will be the dwellers of hell fire wherein they will live forever
Who are more unjust than those who invent falsehoods against God and reject His revelations
These will have their share of torment which is ordained for them and when Our angelic Messengers come to them to cause them to die and ask them Where are those whom you had been worshipping besides God they will reply We had gone astray from the path of God Thus they will testify against their own souls by confessing their disbelief
On the Day of Judgment the Lord will say to them Join the group of jinn and people who lived before you in hell
Each group on entering hell will curse the other dwellers until all of them are brought together therein
The last group will accuse the first saying Lord they made us go astray
Therefore double their torment in the Fire
The Lord will reply For everyone of you there is a double torment but you do not know it
The first will then say You are no better than us suffer the torment as the result of your deeds
For those who have rejected Our revelations out of pride no door to the heavens will be opened nor will they be admitted into Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a sewing needle
Thus do We recompense the criminals
For them hell will be both a cradle and a blanket
Thus do We punish the unjust
The righteously striving believers We do not impose on any soul that which is beyond its ability are the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever
We shall remove all grudges from their hearts
They will enjoy the flowing streams in the garden and will say God who guided us to this deserves all praise
Had He not guided us we would never have been able to find the right direction
The angelic Messengers of our Lord came to us with the Truth
They shall be told This is the Paradise which you have inherited because of your good deeds
The people of Paradise will say to the dwellers of the fire We have found whatever our Lord promised has come true
Have you found whatever the Lord promised you to be true
They will reply Yes we have also found it to be true Thereupon someone will cry out God has condemned the unjust
who prevented others from the way of God sought to make the path appear crooked and had no belief in the Day of Judgment
There will be a barrier between the people of Paradise and hell There will be people on the heights who know everyone by their faces and who will say to the people of Paradise Peace be upon you
They hope to enter Paradise but are not yet therein
When their eyes turn to the dwellers of hell they will pray Lord do not place us among the unjust
The people of the Heights will say to those in hell whose faces they recognize Why did your supporters and your pride not help you
They will also say Are these the people of Paradise the ones of whom you swore would receive no mercy from God
They will continue People of Paradise live therein without any fear or grief
The dwellers of the fire will ask the people of Paradise to give them some water or other things which God has granted to them
They will reply God has deprived the unbelievers of the blessings of Paradise
On that Day We will neglect those who were deceived by the worldly life and who treated their religion as a useless game because they had forgotten such a day and rejected Our revelations
We have revealed the Book of guidance and mercy to the believers and We know all of its details
Despite the clear details of Our guidance in the Book do they still wait for further interpretations
On the Day of Judgment when its interpretations will be revealed those who had ignored its guidance will confess saying The Messengers of our Lord had certainly come to us with the Truth
Will anyone intercede for us or send us back to life so that we would be able to act in a different manner to that which we had done before
These people have certainly lost their souls and their evil inventions which they had used for false excuses will vanish
Your Lord is God who established His dominion over the Throne of the realm after having created the heavens and the earth in six days He made the night darken the day which it pursues at a considerable speed and He made the sun and the moon submissive to His command
Is it not He Who creates and governs all things
Blessed is God the Cherisher of the Universe
Pray to your Lord humbly and privately
God does not love the transgressors
Do not destroy the land after it has been well established but pray to God have fear of Him and hope to receive His mercy
God s mercy is close to the righteous people
God sends the wind bearing the glad news of His mercy
When heavy clouds are formed We drive them unto a barren country and rain down on it water to cause all kinds of fruits to grow
In the same way do We bring the dead to life again
Perhaps you would take heed
A good land produces plants by the permission of its Lord but a wicked land produces only miserable bitter plants
Thus do We show a variety of evidence for those who give thanks
We sent Noah to his people
He told them Worship God for He is your only Lord
I am afraid of the punishment that you might suffer on the great Day of Judgment
A group of his people said to him You are absolutely wrong
Noah said My people I am not in any error rather I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Universe
sent to preach to you the message of my Lord and to give you good advice
I know what you do not know about God
Does it seem strange to you that a reminder from your Lord should be sent to a man from among you to warn you so that you might receive mercy
They accused him of telling lies
So We saved him and his companions in an ark and drowned those who called Our revelations mere lies
They were no doubt a blind people
We sent Hud to his brethren the tribe of Ad who told them Worship God for He is your only Lord Will you not become pious
A group of the unbelievers among his people said You look to us like a fool and we think that you are a liar
He replied My people I am not a fool but a Messenger of the Lord of the Universe
I preach the message of my Lord to you and am a trustworthy advisor for you
Does it seem strange to you that a reminder from your Lord should be sent to a man among you so that He may warn you
Recall when God appointed you as successors of the people of Noah and increased your power over other people
Give thanks to God for His blessings so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness
They said Have you come to make us worship God alone and give up what our fathers worshipped
If you are truthful let the torment with which you have threatened us strike us
He replied You will certainly be afflicted by wickedness and the wrath of God
Do you dispute with me about the names of that which you and your fathers have invented
God has given no authority to those names
Wait for God s decree and I too am waiting with you
Through Our mercy We saved him and his companions and destroyed the unbelievers who called Our revelations mere lies
We sent Salih to his brethren the tribe of Thamud who told them Worship God your only Lord
Authoritative evidence has come to you from your Lord and this shecamel is the evidence for you from God
Let her graze in the land of God
Do not give her any trouble lest a painful torment will strike you
Recall the time when We settled you in the land as the heirs of the tribe of Ad and how you established mansions in the plains and carved homes out of the mountains
Give thanks to God for His favors and do not commit evil in the land
The proud ones among Salih s people asked his oppressed followers Do you really know that Salih is a Messenger of his Lord
They replied We have faith in the Message which he preaches
The proud oppressors said We reject that which you believe in
They then slew the camel and rebelled against the orders of their Lord saying Salih if you are truly a Messenger let that torment with which you have threatened us come to pass
Suddenly an earthquake jolted them and they were left motionless in their homes
He turned away from them saying My people I preached the Message of my Lord to you and gave you good advice but you do not love advisors
Lot told his people Why do you commit such indecent acts that have never been committed by anyone before
You engage in lustful activities with people instead of women
You have become transgressing people
His people had no answer to his remarks but to tell one another Expel him from our town he and his people want to purify themselves
We saved Lot and his family except his wife who remained with the rest
We sent a torrential rain unto the unbelievers
Consider how disastrous the end of the criminals was
We sent to the people of Midian their brother Shu ayb who also told his people to worship God their only Lord
He said A guidance has come to you from your Lord
Maintain proper measures and weights in trade
Do not cause any deficiency in people s property or destroy the land after it has been reformed
This is for your own good if you have any faith
Do not ambush the believers or hinder them from every path that leads them to God just because you wish to make such ways seem crooked
Recall the time when you were just a few in number and God multiplied you
Consider how terrible the end of the evildoers was
If there are some of you who believe in the Message that I have been commanded to preach and there are others who do not exercise patience until God judges among us
He is the best Judge
A proud group among Shu ayb s people said We must expel you Shu ayb and your followers from our town unless you giveup your faith and live as our own people
Shu ayb asked them Will you use force against us
We would certainly be inventing falsehoods against God if we were to accept your way of life when God has already saved us from it
We do not have to accept it unless God our Lord wills it
Our Lord s knowledge covers all things
We trust in Him and ask Him to judge among us and our people for He is the best Judge
A group of the unbelievers among his people told the others If you follow Shu ayb you will certainly lose a great deal
Suddenly an earthquake struck them and left them motionless in their homes
Those who called Shu ayb a liar were destroyed as though they never existed
They certainly were the ones to lose a great deal
He turned away from them saying My people I preached the Message of my Lord to you and gave you good advice
How could I be sorry for the unbelievers
To every town that We sent a Prophet We tested its inhabitants through distress and adversity so that perhaps they would submit themselves to Us
We then replaced their misfortune with wellbeing until they were relieved and began saying Our fathers had also experienced good and bad days
Suddenly We struck them with torment while they were all unaware of what was happening
Had the people of the towns believed in Our revelations and maintained piety We would have certainly showered on them Our blessings from the sky and the earth
But they called Our revelations lies thus Our torment struck them for their evil deeds
Did the people of the towns think themselves secure from Our wrath that could strike them at night during their sleep
or that which could seize them during their busy hours of the day
Did they consider themselves secure from the retribution of God
No one can have such attitude except those who are lost
Is it not a lesson for the successors of the past generations that had We wanted We could have punished them for their sins sealed their hearts and deprived them of hearing
Muhammad such were the stories of the people who lived in different towns in the past
We had sent Our Messengers to them with certain miracles but the people still did not believe in what they had rejected before
Such is how God seals the hearts of the unbelievers
We did not find many among them keeping their promises
However We did find many evildoers among them
After the time of those people We sent Moses with Our miracles to Pharaoh and his people but they too rejected Our miracles
Consider how terrible the end of the evildoers is
Moses told the Pharaoh I am a Messengers from the Lord of the Universe
I must only speak what is true about God
I have brought you miracles from your Lord therefore let the children of Israel go free
The Pharaoh asked Moses to show his miracles if he was telling the truth
So Moses threw down his staff and suddenly it turned into a real serpent
Then he uncovered his hand and it appeared sheer white to the onlookers
Some of the Pharaoh s nobles considered him to be no more than a skillful magician
and said He wants to expel you from your land
They asked others what is your opinion in the matter
The others suggested holding Moses and his brother off and sending to all the cities
to bring together at the Pharaohs court all the skillful magicians
The magicians came to the Pharaoh and said We must have our reward if we are to gain a victory over him Moses
The Pharaoh replied In addition to your rewards you will become my close friends thereafter
The magicians asked Moses Will you throw your staff first or shall we
He replied Throw yours first
Their great magic bewitched people s eyes and terrified them
We inspired Moses to throw his staff and suddenly it began to swallowup all that the magicians had falsely invented
Thus the Truth prevailed and their false art was banished
The magicians who were defeated on the spot and were proved to be worthless
threw themselves down in prostration
saying We declare our belief in the Lord of the Universe
the Lord of Moses and Aaron
The Pharaoh said to the magicians You declared your belief in him Moses without my permission This is a plot to throw my people out of their city
But you will soon know
I will cut off your hands and feet on the alternate sides and crucify you all
The magicians said We will certainly return to Our Lord
You only take revenge on us because we believed in the Lord when we saw His miracles
Lord grant us patience and let us die Muslims submitted to God
Some of the Pharaohs people said Will you let Moses and his people destroy the land and disregard you and your gods
The Pharaoh said We will kill their sons and leave their women alive they are under our domination
Moses told his people to seek help from God and exercise patience
The earth belongs to Him and He has made it the heritage of whichever of His servants He chooses
The final victory is for the pious ones
His people said We suffered a great deal before you came and we are still suffering even after you have come
Moses tried to encourage them by saying There is hope that your Lord will destroy your enemies and make you their successors in the land So consider how you act
For years We afflicted Pharaoh s people with shortages in food so that perhaps they would take heed
But they would always ascribe their wellbeing to themselves and the misfortunes that they would experience to Moses and his people
Their fate is certainly in the hands of God but many of them do not know
They said to Moses No matter what miracle you show to bewitch us we will not believe you
We sent upon them widespread calamities floods of locusts lice frogs and blood
All were distinct miracles but these criminals all the time remained proud
When the torment would strike them they would ask Moses Pray for us to your Lord through your covenant with Him
If He saves us from the torment we shall certainly believe in you and permit you and the children of Israel to leave
But when We relieved them from the torment for a given time they again broke their promise
We took revenge on them for their rejecting Our miracles by drowning them in the sea but they were not aware of reality
We gave the suppressed people the blessed eastern and western regions as their inheritance
Thus the promises of your Lord to the children of Israel all came true because of the patience which they exercised
He destroyed all the establishments of the Pharaoh and his people
We helped the children of Israel to cross the sea
They came to a people who worshipped idols
The Israelites demanded Moses to make gods for them like those of the idolworshippers
Moses told them You are an ignorant people
What these people worship is doomed to be destroyed and their deeds are based on falsehood
Should I choose for you a lord other than God who has favored you above all other people
Children of Israel when I saved you from the Pharaoh and his people who made you suffer the worst kinds of torment killing your sons and keeping your women alive it was a great trial for you from your Lord
We told Moses to stay with Us for thirty nights in the mountains but added ten nights more so his appointment with his Lord came to an end after forty nights
Moses had appointed his brother Aaron as his deputy among his people during his absence saying Try to reform them and do not follow the way of the evildoers
During the appointment the Lord spoke to Moses
He asked the Lord to show Himself so that he could look at Him
The Lord replied You can never see Me
But look at the mountain
If the mountain remains firm only then will you see Me
When the Lord manifested His Glory to the mountain He turned it into dust and Moses fell down upon his face senseless
After regaining his senses Moses said Lord You are all Holy
I repent for what I asked you to do and I am the first to believe in You
The Lord said to Moses I have given you distinction above the people by speaking to you and giving you My Message
Receive what I have given to you and give Us thanks
We wrote advice and laws for him on Tablets about all kinds of things saying Follow them and command your people to follow the good advice therein and I will show you the dwellings of the evildoers
We will deprive those who are wrongly proud in the land of the blessing of revelations
Even if they would see all kinds of miracles they would not have faith or even to see the right path they would not follow it
They would follow the rebellious way if they were to find one in their ignorance they have called Our revelations mere lies
The deeds of those who have called Our revelations and belief in the Day of Judgment mere lies will be turned devoid of all virtue
Can they expect to receive a reward for their deeds other than that which is the result of their deeds
In Moses absence his people manufactured a hollow sounding calf out of their ornaments
Could they not see that it could not speak to them or provide them with any guidance
They gained only evil by worshipping the calf
When they found that they had believed in the wrong thing they regretfully said If our Lord will not have mercy on us and forgive us we will certainly be lost
When Moses returned to his people with anger and sorrow he said What you have done in my absence is certainly evil
Why were you hasty about the commandments of your Lord
He threw away the Tablets which contained the commandments of God grabbed his brother and started to pull him to himself
His brother begged him saying Son of my mother the people suppressed me and almost killed me
Do not humiliate me before the enemies or call me unjust
Moses prayed Lord forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy you are the most Merciful
The Lord said Those who worshipped the calf will be afflicted by the wrath of their Lord and disgraced in their worldly life
Thus We will recompense those who invent falsehood
To those who commit bad deeds but then repent and believe in God Your Lord will certainly be Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When Moses anger calmed down he collected the Tablets
On one of them was written God s mercy and guidance are for those who have fear of Him
Moses selected seventy men from his people to attend Our appointment
In Our presence
When an earthquake jolted them to death Moses said Lord had You wanted to destroy them why did You not destroy them and me before
Are You destroying us for what the fools among us have done
This destruction is only a trial through which You cause some to go astray and guide others
You are our Guardian
Forgive us and have mercy on us You are the best of those who forgive
Grant us wellbeing in this life and in the life hereafter for we have turned ourselves to You The Lord replied My torment only afflicts those whom I want to punish but My mercy encompasses all things I shall grant mercy to those who maintain piety pay their religious tax and those who have faith in Our revelations
There are those who follow the Messengers the illiterate Prophet not conventionally educated whose description they find written in the Torah and the Gospel
He the Messengers enjoins them to do good and forbids them to do all that is unlawful makes lawful for them all that is pure and unlawful all that is filthy removes their burdens and the entanglements in which they are involved
Those who believe in him honor and help him and follow the light which is sent down to him will have everlasting happiness
Muhammad tell them People I have come to you all as the Messengers of God to whom the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs
There is no God but He
In His hands are life and death
Have faith in God and His Messengers the unlettered Prophet who believes in God and His words Follow him so that you will perhaps have guidance
Among the people of Moses are some whose guidance and Judgment are based on the Truth
We divided the descendants of Israel into twelve tribes and told Moses to strike the rock with his staff to let twelve fountains gush out therefrom his people had asked him to supply them with water
The twelve flowing springs were divided among them a spring for each tribe and each tribe knew its drinking place well
We provided them with shade from the clouds sent down manna and quails to them for food and told them to eat the pure things which We had given them
They did not do injustice to Us but they wronged themselves
When they were told Settle down in this town eat as you wish seek forgiveness and enter the gate prostrating yourselves in obedience to the Lord and We will forgive you your sins and increase the reward of the righteous people
the unjust among them changed the words which they were told to say in the prayer
Therefore We sent upon them torment from the sky for their wrong deeds
Muhammad ask them about the people of the towns on the seashore
They had transgressed by catching fish on the Sabbath
Each Sabbath the fish came openly within their reach but not so on other days
Thus We were testing them because of their evil deeds
When a group of them questioned another group saying Why do you preach to those whom God has decided to destroy or punish by a severe torment they replied We preach to them for we are responsible in the sight of your Lord and so that perhaps they may have fear of God
When they the unjust people forgot what was preached to them We saved the preachers from evil and afflicted the unjust for their evil deeds with a dreadful torment
When they crossed the limit of the prohibition We made them turn into detested apes
Muhammad consider when your Lord declared to the Israelites His decision to raise a people above them who would make them suffer the worst kinds of torments until the Day of Judgment
Certainly your Lord s retribution is swift
He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
We divided them into nations on the earth some are righteous and others are not
We tested them with wellbeing and hardship so that they might return to the right path
Their descendants who inherited the Book gained by bribery only worthless things from the worldly life saying We shall be forgiven for what we have done
They would have even doubled such gains if they could have received more
Did they not make a covenant with God in the Book not to speak any thing other than the Truth about God and to study its contents well
The life hereafter is much better for the pious ones
Will you not then think
Those who devote themselves to the teachings of the Book and are steadfast in prayer should know that the reward of those who reform themselves will not be lost
When We raised the mount above them as a shadow and made it speak to them they thought that it would fall on them
We told them to devote themselves decisively to what was given to them and follow its guidance so that they would have fear of God
When your Lord asked all the offspring of Adam before their birth Am I not your Lord All of them testified and bore witness to their testimony that on the Day of Judgment they would not say We were not aware of this fact
or say Our fathers worshipped idols before us and we as their descendants followed them
Would you then destroy us because of what the followers of falsehood have done
Thus do We explain Our revelations so that they might return to the right path
Muhammad tell them the story of the person whom We inspired with Our guidance but who detached himself from it and who was then pursued by Satan until he turned into a rebel
Had We wanted We could have raised him to an exalted position but he clung to his earthly life and followed his own evil desires
Such person s bad habits are like those of a lazy dog in a warm climate who always has its tongue hanging out whether you chase it away or leave it alone
Such are the people who have called Our revelations mere lies
Muhammad tell them such stories so that perhaps they will think
How terrible is the example of those who have rejected Our revelations and have done injustice only to themselves
Those whom God has guided have the true guidance but those whom He has caused to go astray are certainly lost
We have destined many men and jinn for hell
They have hearts but do not understand eyes but do not see
They have ears but do not hear
They are worse than lost cattle
These are the heedless ones
God has the most blessed Names
You should address Him in your worship by these Names and keep away from those who pervert them
They will be recompensed for their evil deeds
Among Our creatures are a group who guide and judge with the Truth
We gradually lead those who have called Our revelations mere lies to destruction Their destruction will be such that they will not even notice how it seized them
Though I have given them a respite My plan against them is well established
Why will they not understand that their companion Muhammad is not possessed by jinn
Muhammad is only a Divinely authorized preacher
Have they not considered the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything that God has created Perhaps death approaches them
In what kind of guidance can they have faith besides that of the Quran
No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray and has left to continue blindly in their rebellion
They ask you Muhammad When will the Day of Judgment be
Tell them My Lord knows best
It is He who has appointed its time
It will be a grave hour both in the heavens and the earth
It will only approach you suddenly
They say It seems that you know about the coming of the Day of Judgment
Tell them Only God knows about it and most people do not know
Muhammad say I have no control over my benefits or sufferings without the will of God
Had I known about the unseen I would have gained much good and would have faced no suffering
I am only a warner and I preach the glad news to the believing people
It is God Who created you from a single soul and out of it made its spouse to bring it comfort
When he man engaged in carnal relations with her she conceived a light burden which she had to carry
When the baby grew in her womb they husband and wife both prayed to their Lord If You grant us a healthy son we shall certainly give you thanks
When they were given a healthy son they began to love him as much as they loved God
God is too exalted to be loved equally to anything else
Do they the pagans consider things that do not create anything but are themselves created equal to God
The idols are things that are not able to help others or even themselves
Believers even if you invite them to true guidance they will not follow you
It makes no difference whether you invite them or whether you keep quiet
Those whom you pagans worship besides God are themselves servants just like yourselves If your claim was true they should answer your prayers
Do they the idols have feet to walk hands to hold things eyes to see and ears to hear
Muhammad tell them the pagans to call on their idols for help and to plan against Me without delay
The true Guardian is certainly God who has revealed the Book and is the Guardian of the righteous ones
The idols which you the pagans worship besides God can neither help you nor themselves
Muhammad if you invite them to the right guidance they will not listen to you
You will see them looking at you but they do not really see
Have forgiveness preach the truth and keep away from the ignorant ones
If Satan will try to seduce you seek refuge from God
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
When a satanic thought starts to bother the pious ones they understand and see the light
while their brethren ceaselessly try to drag them into error
If you Muhammad do not show them a miracle they will keep on insisting that you must show them one Say I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord
This Quran contains wisdom for you from your Lord
It contains guidance and mercy for those who have faith
Whenever the Quran is recited to you listen to it quietly so that you may receive mercy
Remember your Lord deep within yourselves humbly and privately instead of shouting out loud in prayer in the mornings and evenings and do not be of the heedless ones
Those who are near to your Lord do not disdain from worshipping Him
They glorify Him and prostrate themselves in obedience to Him
They the believers ask you Muhammad about the booty captured from the enemies during a war
Tell them It belongs to God and the Messengers
If you have faith have fear of God Settle the disputes among yourselves and obey God and His Messengers
When God is mentioned the true believers begin to feel fear of Him in their hearts and when His revelations are recited to them their faith strengthens In God alone do they trust
They are steadfast in prayer and spend part of what We have given them for the cause of God
Such are the true believers
Their reward from their Lord will be high ranks forgiveness and a generous provision
A group among the believers dislike God s decree about the booty captured in war as well as His command that you come out of your home for a truthful purpose to fight for justice
Knowing it well that a fight in which they are to take part is about to take place they act as though they are being driven to death which they can see before their very eyes Despite their knowledge of the truth they still argue with you
When God promised to grant you believers victory over either one of the two groups you wished to have control over the unarmed one
God decided to prove to you the truth of His promises and to destroy the unbelievers
so that the truth would stand supreme and falsehood would exist no more even though the criminals dislike it
When you believers begged for assistance from your Lord He said I am helping you with a thousand angels all in rows marching one after the other
God has sent this glad news to comfort your hearts
Victory is in the hands of God alone
God is Majestic and Allwise
The slumber that overcame you was from God that brought you peace He showered water from the sky over you to clean you remove satanic wickedness from you strengthen your hearts and grant you steadfastness
Your Lord inspired the angels saying I am with you
Encourage the believers
I shall cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers and you will strike their heads and limbs
they have opposed God and His Messengers
For those who oppose God and His Messengers God has prepared a severe retribution
We will say to them Endure the torment as a consequence of your evil deeds the unbelievers deserve nothing better than the torment of fire
Believers do not retreat when facing the marching army of the unbelievers for no believer will turn back at that time except for strategic reasons or to join another band
Whoever deserts the believers will incur the wrath of God and will dwell in hell a terrible dwelling
It was not you believers but God who slew the pagans
It was not you Muhammad but God who threw dust at them
He did this as a favorable test for the believers
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
This is how God causes the evil plans of the unbelievers to fail
If you the pagans are looking for conquest you certainly had a great chance at the battle of Badr
But if you were to give up such a desire it would be better for you
If you again wage war against Us We will be ready for such a confrontation
Your manpower will be of no help to you no matter how much you have God is with the believers
Believers obey God and His Messengers and do not turn away from Him when you hear His commands
Do not be like those who said that they have heard the Messenger s commands but do not pay any attention to them
The most wicked beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb who have no understanding
Had they possessed any virtue God would certainly have made them hear
Even if God were to make them hear they would still turn away from the words of God
Believers listen to God and the Messengers when they call you to that which gives you life
Know that God is between a man and his heart and that before Him you will all be brought together
Guard yourselves against discord among yourselves so that it will not mislead anyone of you especially the unjust and know that God s retribution is most severe
Recall the time when you the believers were only a few suppressed people in the land afraid of being terrorized by the people
God gave you shelter supported you with His help and bestowed on you pure provisions so that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Believers do not be dishonest to God and the Messengers or knowingly abuse your trust
Know that your possessions and children are a temptation for you and that God has the greatest reward for the righteous ones
Believers if you fear God He will give you guidance will expiate your bad deeds and forgive you
God s favors are the greatest
The unbelievers planned to imprison murder or expel you Muhammad from your city
They make evil plans but God too plans and God s plans are the best
When Our revelations are recited to them the unbelievers they say We have heard them
Had we wanted we could also have composed such statements they are no more than ancient legends
They also say Lord if this Quran is the Truth from you shower down stones on us from the sky instead of rain or send us a painful punishment
God would not punish them while you were among them nor while they were asking for forgiveness
Why should God not punish them when they hinder people from entering the sacred mosque
They are not its true patrons Only the righteous ones are its patrons but most of the pagans do not know
Their unbelievers prayer at the mosque is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands
We shall tell them Suffer torment for your disbelief
The disbelievers spend their wealth to turn men away from the way of God
They will continue to spend but it will become a source of regret for them and they will be defeated because of their evil plans
The disbelievers will be gathered all togdher in Hell
God will separate the wicked from the pure and will pile the wicked ones on top of one anothcr to be cast into hell
They are indeed lost
Muhammad tell the unbelievers if you give up your evil behavior God will forgive whatever you have done in the past
But if you transgras again your fate will be the same as that of those unbelievers who lived before you
Fight them so that idolatry will not exist any more and God s religion will stand supreme
If theygive up the idols God will be Well Aware of what they do
If the unbelievers turn away from the faith God is you believers best Guardian and best Helper
Know that whatever property you may gain one fifth belongs to God the Messenger the kindred orphans the needy and those who need money while on a journey This is the law if you believe in God and what We revealed to Our Servant on the Day of Distinction Badr when the armies confronted each other
God has power over all things
Recall when your army was positioned at the less defensible brink of the valley the pagans army had the more defensible higher side of the valley and the caravan was led out of your reach below
This situation did not take place according to your previous plans otherwise everything would have been different
It was God s plan to place you in a vulnerable position exposed to the enemy and it was His plan to lead the caravan out of your reach so that His decree that you would be granted a victory by a miracle would become a doubtless fact and so that those who were to be destroyed would face destruction with a clear knowledge of the Truth and those who were to survive would also survive with a clear knowledge of the Truth
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
In your dream God showed the pagans army as being only a few in number for if He had showed them as a great number you would have lost courage and would have started to quarrel among yourselves concerning this matter
But God saved you from that condition He knows what is in your hearts
When you met the pagans army God made them appear fewer in your eyes and you appear fewer in their eyes so that His miracle of granting you an incredible victory could easily be fulfilled
To God do all things return
Believers stand firm when you meet a band of your enemy and remember God often so that you may have everlasting happiness
Obey God and His Messenger
Do not quarrel with each other lest you fail or lose honor
Exercise patience God is with those who have patience
Do not be like those who marched out boastfully to show off their strength to people and hinder people from the way of God
God encompasses everyone s activities
Satan made their pagans deeds seem attractive to them and said to them No one today is more powerful than you and I am your supporter
But when the two armies confronted one another and the pagans were defeated then satan betrayed his friends saying I am not with you any more I see what you do not see and I am afraid of God
God is severe in His retribution
The hypocrites and those whose hearts are sick say The believers religion has deceived them
Those who trust in God will find Him Majestic and Allwise
Would that you could have seen the angels taking the souls of the unbelievers away from their bodies and smiting their faces and their backs saying Suffer the burning torment
This is the result of their deeds
God is not unjust to His servants
The same thing happened to the people of Pharaoh and those who lived before them
They rejected the revelations of God and because of their sins His retribution struck them
God is Allpowerful and stern in His retribution
God does not change the favor that He has bestowed on a nation unless that nation changes what is in its soul
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Like the people of the Pharaoh and those who lived before them the unbelievers rejected the revelations of God
We destroyed them for their sins and drowned the people of Pharaoh
They were all unjust
The most wicked creatures in the sight of God are the unbelievers who never have faith
who make promises but break them every time and who have no piety
When you capture the unbelievers during a fight teach them a lesson so that they thereafter will always be aware of the threat of your power
If you are afraid of the treachery of some of your allies you may disregard your treaty with them
God does not love the treacherous ones
The unbelievers should not think that they can really escape Us or that they can never be defeated
Mobilize your defensive force as much as you can to frighten the enemies of God and your own enemies This also will frighten those who are behind them whom you do not know but God knows well
Whatever you spend for the cause of God He will give you sufficient recompense with due justice
If they the unbelievers propose peace accept it and trust in God
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
If they want to deceive you God is Allsufficient for you
It is God who supported you with His own help and with that of the believers
among whose hearts He has placed affection and unity
If you were to spend the wealth of the whole earth you would not have been able to unite their hearts but God has been able to unite them God is Majestic and Allwise
Prophet God and the believers who follow you are sufficient support for you
Prophet mobilize the believers for the battle
It will take only twenty of your men who are steadfast in prayer to defeat two hundred unbelieving men
Your two hundred men would defeat their two thousand the unbelievers have no understanding
Now that God has eased your burden He has found you to be weak
A hundred of your steadfast men would defeat two hundred of theirs and a thousand of yours would defeat two thousand of the unbelievers by the will of God
God is with those who have patience
The Prophet is not supposed to take any captives to strengthen his position on the earth
You want worldly gains but God wants the life hereafter for you
God is Majestic and Allwise
Had you taken captives before being allowed by God s revelations a great torment would have struck you for what you had done
Use what you have acquired from the battle as your own good lawful property
Have fear of God He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Prophet tell the captives with you If God finds anything good in your hearts He will give you a better reward than that which was taken from you and will forgive you
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Do not be surprised that they want to be dishonest with you they have always been dishonest with God
However He has power over them
God is Allknowing and Allwise
The believers who left their homes and strove for the cause of God through their property and in person and those who gave refuge to them and helped them will be each other s guardians
The believers who did not leave their homes are not your guardians until they too leave their homes
If they ask you for help in a religious cause you must help them against their enemies unless their enemies have a peace treaty with you
God is Well Aware of what you do
The unbelievers are each other s friends
If you the believers do not keep the same among yourselves in the land there will come into being widespread idolatry and great evil
The believers who left their homes and strove for the cause of God and those who gave them refuge and helped them are true believers
They will have forgiveness from their Lord and will be granted honorable provisions
Those who accepted the faith later left their homes and strove with you for the cause of God are also your people
They relatives are nearer to each other according to the Book of God
God has knowledge of all things
God and His Messenger declare the abrogation of the peace treaty that existed between them and the pagans
However during the four sacred months they pagans may travel peacefully through the land
Know pagans that you cannot make God helpless but it is God who has the power to disgrace the unbelievers
This Announcement from God and His Messenger is to be made to the people on the day of the great Pilgrimage God and His Messenger have declared no amnesty for the pagans
If you pagans repent it would be better for you but if you turn away from God know that you cannot make God helpless
Muhammad tell the unbelievers that a painful punishment has been prepared for them
This does not apply to the pagans with whom you have a valid peace treaty and who have not broken it from their side or helped others against you
You believers must fulfill the terms of the peace treaty with them
God loves the pious ones
When the sacred months are over slay the pagans wherever you find them Capture besiege and ambush them
If they repent perform prayers and pay the religious tax set them free
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
If any of the pagans ask you to give them refuge give them asylum so that they may hear the words of God
Then return them to their towns for they are an ignorant people
How can the pagans except those with whom you have established a peace treaty in the precinct of the Sacred Mosque have a covenant with God and His Messenger
If they respect the pact you too should also follow its terms
God loves the pious ones
How could God and His Messenger grant them pagans peace when if they were to acquire superiority over you they would respect none of the peace treaties nor their kindred relations with you
They only try to please you by paying lipservice to you but their hearts are against you and most of them are evildoers
They have sold God s revelations for a paltry price and have created obstacles in the way of God
What they have done is evil
They do not respect their promises nor their family ties with the believers
They are transgressors
If they repent perform their prayers pay religious tax they would be your brothers in the religion
We explain Our revelations to people of knowledge
Fight against the leaders of the unbelievers if they violate their established peace treaty with you and revile your faith to force them to stop their aggression against you
You do not have to bind yourselves to such a treaty
Why will you not fight against a people who have broken their peace treaty with you have decided to expel the Messenger from his home town and who were the first to disregard the peace treaty
If you are true believers you should only have fear of God
Fight them May God punish them by your hands humiliate them give you victory over them delight the hearts of the believers
and appease their anger
God forgives whomever He wants and He is Allknowing and Allwise
Do you think that God will not make any distinction between those of you who have fought for His cause and have relied on no one other than God His Messenger and the faithful ones and other people
God is Well Aware of what you do
The pagans do not have any right to establish and patronize the mosque of God while they testify against their souls to its disbelief
Their deeds are devoid of all virtue and they will live forever in hell fire
Only those who believe in God the Day of Judgment perform their prayers pay the religious tax and have fear of God alone have the right to establish and patronize the mosque of God so that perhaps they will have the right guidance
Do you pagans because you served water to the pilgrims and constructed the Sacred Mosque consider yourselves equal to those who have believed in God the Day of Judgment and have fought for the cause of God
In the sight of God you pagans are not equal to the believers
God does not guide the unjust
To those who have believed in God left their homes and fought for His cause with their possessions and in person God will grant high ranks and success
Their Lord will give the glad news of His granting mercy to them His pleasure and His admitting them to a Paradise full of everlasting bounties wherein they will live forever
The reward that God will bestow on His servants is the greatest
Believers do not accept your fathers and brothers as your guardians if they prefer disbelief to faith lest you be unjust
Muhammad tell them If your fathers children brothers spouses relatives the property that you possess the trade you fear may have no profit and the homely life are more beloved to you than God His Messenger and fighting for His cause wait until God fulfills His decree of making the right distinct from the wrong
God does not guide the evildoers
God has helped you on many occasions including the day of Hunayn name of a place near Mecca
When you were happy with the number of your men who proved to be of no help to you and the whole vast earth seemed to have no place to hide you from your enemies and you turned back in retreat
God gave confidence to His Messenger and the believers and helped them with an army which you could not see God punished the unbelievers this is the only recompense that the unbelievers deserve
After that occasion God forgave those whom He wanted
God is Allknowing and Allmerciful
Believers the pagans are filthy Do not let them come near to the Sacred Mosque after this year
If you are afraid of poverty He will make you rich if He wishes by His favor
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Fight against those People of the Book who have no faith in God or the Day of Judgment who do not consider unlawful what God and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not believe in the true religion until they humbly pay tax with their own hands
Some of the Jews have said that Ezra is the son of God and Christians have said the same of Jesus
This is only what they say and it is similar to what the unbelievers who lived before them had said
May God destroy them wherever they exist
They unconditionally obeyed the rabbis and the monks and worshipped the Messiah son of Mary as they should have obeyed God They were commanded to worship no one besides God who is the only God and who is too exalted to be considered equal to any idols
They would like to extinguish the light of God with a blow from their mouths but even though the unbelievers may dislike it God has decided to let His light shine forever
It is God Who sent His Messenger with guidance and a true religion that will prevail over all other religions even though the pagans may dislike it
Believers many rabbis and monks consume other people s property by false means and create obstacles in the way of God
Those who horde gold and silver and do not spend anything out of it for the cause of God should know that their recompense will be a painful torment
on the Day of Judgment and that their treasures will be heated by the fire of hell and pressed against their foreheads sides and back with this remark These are your own treasures which you hoarded for yourselves
See for yourselves what they feel like
According to the Book of God from the day He created the heavens and the earth the number of months are twelve four of which are sacred
This is part of the law of the religion
Do not commit injustice against your souls during the sacred months but fight all the pagans just as they fight against all of you Know that God is with the pious ones
To disregard the observation of the sacred months and to observe it during the nonsacred months is to add more to one s disbelief This causes the unbelievers to go further astray
One year they the pagans consider a sacred month not sacred and observe it during a nonsacred month but the next year they consider it sacred at the right time
By dealing with the sacred months in such a manner they think that they have observed the laws of God but in fact they have changed them
Their evil deeds seem attractive to them but God does not guide the unbelieving people
Believers why is it that when you are told to march for the cause of God you seem to linger at home
Have you given preference to the worldly life over the life hereafter
The worldly gains compared to those of the next life are but very little
If you do not march for His cause He will afflict your with a painful punishment and replace you by another nation and your destruction will not harm Him at all
God has power over all things
If you do not help him Muhammad God has already helped him
When the unbelievers expelled him and he was one of the two people in the cave telling his friend Do not worry God is with us then God gave him confidence and supported him with an army which you did not see and He defeated the cause of the disbelievers and made His own cause stand supreme
God is Majestic and Allwise
Whether unarmed or well equipped march and fight for the cause of God with your possessions and in person
This would be better for you if only you knew it
Had the gain been immediate or the journey shorter they hypocrites would certainly have followed you Muhammad but it was too far for them
They will swear by God Had we had the ability we would certainly have marched with you
They destroy only themselves and God knows that they are lying
May God forgive you
Muhammad why did you not let them join the army so that you could discern the liars from the truthful ones
Those who believe in God and the Day of Judgment do not ask you whether they should fight for the cause of God with their property and in person or not
God knows all about the pious ones
Only those who do not believe in God and the Day of Judgment ask you such questions because their hearts are full of doubts and they cannot make any final decisions
Had they the hypocrites wanted to join your army they would have prepared themselves but God did not wish to motivate them so He caused them to linger behind with those whose joining you in battle would be of no use
Had they joined you they would have been of no help to you but would have just caused confusion and trouble among you by sneaking through the ranks where some of you would be ready to listen to them
God knows best the unjust
Even prior to this they tried to cause trouble and to turn your affairs upsidedown until the truth came and the cause of God triumphed against their desires
Some of them ask you Make us exempt from taking part in the battle and do not try to tempt us by telling us what we may gain from the battle many people have died in the battle
Hell certainly encompasses the unbelievers
If you gain success it grieves them but if you suffer hardship they turn away from you saying It s good that we took our affairs into our own hands
Muhammad say Nothing will happen to us besides what God has decreed for us
He is our Guardian
In God alone do the believers trust
For us you can anticipate nothing other than Paradise if we are killed or success if we triumph However what we can anticipate for you is either punishment by the hands of God or by ours
Wait and we too are waiting with you
Say Whether you spend your wealth for the cause of God willingly or reluctantly it will never be accepted from you you are an evil doing people
What prevents their offerings from being accepted is their disbelief in God and His Messenger their lack of interest in prayer and spending for the cause of God reluctantly
Let not their property and children tempt you God wants to punish them through their things in this life so that their souls will depart while they are unbelievers
They swear by God that they are believers like you but they are not believers
They are a people who only cause differences
They are so afraid of you that had there been a place for them to seek refuge a cave or some entrance in which to hide themselves from you they would have madly rushed therein
They blame you about the distribution of the welfare funds
They are pleased when you give them something from it but if they receive nothing they become angry with you
Would that they had been pleased with what God and His Messenger had given them and had said God is AllSufficient for us
God and His Messenger will soon do us more favors and we have hope in God s mercy
Welfare funds zakat are only for the poor the destitute the tax collectors those whose hearts are inclined towards Islam the slaves those who cannot pay their debts for the cause of God and for those who have become needy on a journey Paying zakat is an obligation that God has decreed
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Some of them speak ill of the Prophet saying He listens to everything and believes what he hears
Muhammad tell them He only listens to what is good for you believes in God and has trust in the believers
He is a mercy for the believers among you
Those who speak ill of the Messenger of God will face a painful punishment
They hypocrites swear by God in their effort to please you but if they were true believers they would know that God and His Messenger deserve more to be pleased than anyone else
Do they not know that for displeasing God and His Messenger one would be admitted to Hell wherein he would live forever
This indeed is a great humiliation
The hypocrites are afraid that some revelation will be revealed thus making public what is in their hearts
Muhammad tell them Continue in your mockery God will certainly let whatever causes you worry to take place
If you question them about their manners they say We were only arguing for the sake of amusement
Ask them Were you mocking God His revelations and His Messenger
Make no excuses
You have certainly turned back to disbelief
If We forgive one group of you We must punish the other for they are guilty
Be they male or female hypocrites they are the same
They make others commit sins prevent them from doing good deeds and restrain their hands from spending for the cause of God
They have forgotten all about God who also has ignored them
The hypocrites indeed are evildoers
For the hypocrites and the unbelievers God has prepared hell wherein they will live forever
Hell is their proper punishment
God has condemned them and they will suffer a permanent torment
like that of those who lived before you whose power wealth and children were much greater than yours
They enjoyed their share of the worldly gains and you also like them have enjoyed yours
You have been sneaking among the people to cause trouble just as they had been doing before you
Such people s deeds are devoid of all virtue both in this life and in the life hereafter
They indeed are lost
Have they not heard the stories of the people of Noah the tribe of Ad Thamud the people of Abraham the dwellers of the city of Midian and those of the Subverted Cities
God s Messengers came to each of them with miracles
God did not do any injustice to them but they wronged themselves
The believers both male and female are each other s guardians
They try to make others do good prevent them from committing sins perform their prayers pay the religious tax and obey God and His Messenger
God will have mercy on them He is Majestic and Allwise
God has promised the believers gardens wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever in the excellent mansions of the garden of Eden
What is more important than all this for them is that God is pleased with them
Such is the supreme triumph
Prophet fight the unbelievers and hypocrites vehemently for the cause of God Their dwelling is hell a terrible destination
They the hypocrites swear by the Name of God to make others believe in what they are saying
They have spoken the testimony of disbelief and have then turned back to disbelief They have made unsuccessful attempts to cause trouble
There is no other reason for their ungratefulness except that God and His Messenger enriched them through their favors
If they repent it will be better for them but if they turn away from the faith God will make them suffer a painful punishment both in this life and in the life hereafter
They will find no guardian nor any helper in the land
Some of them have promised God that if He will favor them they will certainly spend for His cause and be righteous ones
But when His favors were bestowed on them they became niggardly and in disregard broke their promise
God will for their disregard of their promise and their telling lies place hypocrisy in their hearts which will not leave them until they face the consequences of their deeds
Were they not aware that God knows all that they hide or whisper and that He has absolute knowledge of the unseen
God mocks those hypocrites who blame and mock the rich or poor believers who donate to the welfare funds and He has prepared a painful torment for them
Muhammad whether you ask God to forgive them or not He will never do so even if you were to beg seventy times they have disbelieved in God and His Messenger and God does not guide the evildoers
Those who did not take part in the battle of Tabuk were glad about their staying home against the order of the Messenger of God They did not want to fight for the cause of God with their property and in person and said Do not march to the battle on the hot days
Muhammad tell them The heat of hell fire is much more severe if only you would understand
They should laugh less and weep more as a recompense for what they have gained
When God brings you back safely and a group of hypocrites ask you to make them exempt from taking part in the battle tell them Never march with me and never fight with us against any of the enemies of God
You chose to linger behind the first time so this time stay behind with those who are of no help in the battle
Should any of them die never pray for him or stand on his grave
They have disbelieved in God and His Messenger and have died while committing evil
Their wealth or children should not tempt you God wants to punish them through these things in this life so that they will die as disbelievers
When a chapter of the Quran is revealed telling them to believe in God and fight along with His Messenger for His cause against His enemies the healthy and rich ones of them ask you to exempt them from taking part in the battle for the cause of God and to let them stay home with the people who are of no help in the battle
They are happy to stay home with those who are of no help in the battle thus their hearts were sealed and they were left with no understanding
But the Messenger of God and the believers with him fought for the cause of God with their possessions and in person and their reward will be all good things and everlasting happiness
God has established gardens for them wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
This indeed is the greatest triumph
Some of the dwellers of the desert who were not able to join the army came to the Prophet seeking exemption from taking part in the battle
Those who called God and His Messengers liars also stayed home with those who were truly exempt
The disbelievers will soon receive a painful punishment
People who are weak or sick and those who do not have the means to take part in the fighting are exempt from this duty if their intention remains sincere about God and His Messenger
Righteous people shall not be blamed
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who come to you Muhammad asking to be taken to the battle but you cannot find the necessary means for them are exempt from the duty of fighting for the cause of God even though they leave you with their eyes flooded with tears because of not being able to help the cause of God
The blameworthy ones are those who ask for exemption despite their ability and who preferred to stay at home with those who are truly exempt
God has placed a seal on their hearts but they do not know
They will apologize to you on your return
Tell them Do not ask for pardon We will never believe you
God has already told us everything about you
God and His Messenger will soon make your deeds public then you will return to Him who has absolute knowledge of the unseen and the seen and He will inform you of what you have done
When you return they will appeal to you in the Name of God to leave them alone
So leave them alone
They are filthy and their dwelling will be hell as a recompense for what they had gained
They swear in the Name of God to please you
Even if you were to be pleased with them God is not pleased with evildoing people
The desert dwelling Arabs are far worse than the others in their disbelief and hypocrisy and have more reason to be ignorant of the revelations that God revealed to His Messenger
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Whatever some of the desert dwelling Arabs spend for the cause of God they consider it a loss to themselves
They wish to see you in trouble Trouble has struck them already
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Some of the desert dwelling Arabs believe in God and the Day of Judgment Whatever they spend for the cause of God they consider it as a means of getting nearer to God and have the prayers of the Messenger in their favor
This certainly is a means to get nearer to God
God will admit them into His mercy
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God is well pleased with the foremost ones of those who left their homes for the cause of God those who helped them after their arrival in Medina and those who nobly followed these two groups
He has prepared gardens for them wherein streams flow and wherein they will live forever
This certainly is the supreme triumph
Some of the desert dwelling Arabs around you are hypocrites as are some of the inhabitants of Medina
They are persisting in their hypocrisies
You do not know them but We know them well and will punish them twice over
Then they will be brought to the great torment on the Day of Judgment
Some of them have already confessed their sins and have mixed virtuous deeds with sinful ones
Perhaps God will forgive them
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Collect religious tax zakat from them to purify and cleanse them and pray for them your prayers give them comfort God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Do they not know that it is God who accepts the repentance of His servants and receives the welfare funds and that it is God who is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad tell them Act as you wish
God His Messenger and the believers will see your deeds
You will be brought before the One who has absolute knowledge of the unseen and the seen He will let you know about all that you have done
Besides those who have confessed their sins there are others who have no good deeds for which they may receive any reward or sins for which they may be punished
Their fate will be in the hands of God
God is Allknowing and Allwise
The mosque which some of the hypocrites have established is only to harm people to spread disbelief to create discord among the believers to wait for the one who fought against God and His Messenger and to make others believe that it has been established with their good intentions But God testifies that they are liars
Muhammad never stay in that mosque
The mosque which was established for a pious purpose and before all other mosques is more virtuous for your prayer
In this mosque there are people who love to be purified God loves those who purify themselves
Which is better the mosque that is founded for pious purposes and for achieving God s pleasure or that which is based on the brink of a crumbling bank and which may crumble into hell at any moment
God does not guide the unjust
The building mosque which they have built always motivates mischief in their hearts until their hearts are cut into pieces
God is Allknowing and Allwise
God has purchased the souls and property of the believers in exchange for Paradise They fight for the cause of God to destroy His enemies and to sacrifice themselves
This is a true promise which He has revealed in the Torah the Gospel and the Quran
No one is more true to His promise than God
Let this bargain be glad news for them This is indeed the supreme triumph
The believers who repent for their sins worship God praise Him travel through the land for pious purposes kneel down and prostrate themselves in obedience to God make others do good and prevent them from sins and abide by the laws of God will receive a great reward
Let this be glad news for the believer
After it was made clear that the pagans are to be the dwellers of hell the Prophet and the believers should not have sought forgiveness from God for them even though they may have been relatives
There was no other reason for Abraham to seek forgiveness from God for his father except the promise that he had made with him
When Abraham knew that his father was an enemy of God he disowned his father
Abraham was very tenderhearted and forbearing
God does not misguide a nation after having given them guidance until the means of piety are made known to them
God knows all things
To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth
He grants life and causes death
God is your only Guardian and Helper
God pardoned the Prophet the Emigrants the Helpers and those who followed them when the hearts of some of them almost deviated from the truth in their hour of difficulty
God forgave them because of His Compassion and Mercy
God also forgave the three people who lagged behind
Grief made them feel as though there was no place in the whole vast earth to hide them or in their souls to conceal their sorrow
They began to believe that no one could save them from the wrath of God except He Himself
God pardoned them so that they would also repent for their sins God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Believers have fear of God and always be friends with the truthful ones
The inhabitants of the city of Medina and the desert Arabs dwelling around it were not supposed to disobey the Messenger of God or to give priority to their own lives above that of the Prophet For if they had given priority to the life of the Messenger of God they would not have experienced the hardships of thirst fatigue or hunger in their struggle for the cause of God nor would their travelling have enraged the disbelievers and they would not have received any injury from enemies that God would not record for them as a virtuous deed
God does not ignore the reward of those who do good
Also they would not have spent anything great or small for the cause of God or travel through a valley without God decreeing a reward for them far better than whatever they had done
Not all believers have to become specialists in religious learning
Why do not some people from each group of believers seek to become specialists in religious learning and after completing their studies guide their group so that they will have fear of God
Believers fight the unbelievers near you for the cause of God so that they realize your strength and know that God is with the pious ones
When a chapter of the Quran is revealed some people ask others Whose faith among you people has received strength from this revelation
It the revelation certainly strengthens the faith of the believers and they consider it to be a glad news
But to those whose hearts are sick it adds more filth to their hearts and they die as disbelievers
Do they not realize that God tests them once or twice a year but nevertheless they do not repent and give it proper thought
When a chapter of the Quran is revealed it upsets them They look at one another and their eyes silently ask this question Has any one noticed the disappointment on our faces
Then they walk away In fact God has turned their hearts away from the truth they are a people who have no understanding
A Messenger from your own people has come to you
Your destruction and suffering is extremely grievous to him He really cares about you and is very compassionate and merciful to the believers
Muhammad if they turn away from you say God is Sufficient support for me
There is no God but He
In Him do I trust and He is the Owner of the Great Throne
Alif Lam
Ra These are the verses of the Book of wisdom
Why should it seem strange to mankind that We sent revelations to a mortal among them who would warn others and give to the believers the glad news of their high rank in the sight of God The unbelievers have said He Muhammad is certainly a magician
God is your Lord who has created the heavens and the earth in six days and established His Dominion over the Throne He maintains order over the creation
No one can intercede for others without His permission
It is God who is your only Lord
Worship only Him
Will you then not think
People you will all return to God
The promise of God is true He creates all things and after their death brings them to life again so that He may justly reward the righteously striving believers
The disbelievers will drink boiling filthy water and suffer painful torment as a recompense for their disbelief
It is God who has made the sun radiant and the moon luminous and has appointed for the moon certain phases so that you may compute the number of years and other reckonings
God has created them for a genuine purpose
He explains the evidence of His existence to the people of knowledge
The alternation of the day and night and all that God has created in the heavens and earth are evidence of the existence of God for the pious people
Those who do not have hope of receiving Our mercy in the life hereafter who are pleased and satisfied with the worldly life and who pay no attention to Our revelations
will all have the Fire as their dwelling for that which they had done
The righteously striving believers receive through their faith guidance from their Lord to the bountiful gardens wherein streams flow
Their prayer shall be Glory be to you Lord and their greeting Peace be with you and the only other words of worldly speech they will speak will be It is God Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
Had God been as hasty to punish people as they were hasty to achieve good their life would have already ended
We will leave those who have no hope of receiving Our mercy in the life hereafter to continue blindly in their transgression
When the human being is affected by hardship he starts to pray while lying on his side sitting or standing but when We relieve him from hardship he starts to act as though he had never prayed to Us to save him from the misfortune
This is how transgressors deeds are made attractive to them
We destroyed certain generations who lived before you because of their injustice Our Messengers came to them and showed them miracles but they would not believe
Thus do We punish the criminals
We have made you their successors in the land so that We could see how you behaved
Whenever Our authoritative revelations are recited to those who do not wish to meet Us in the life hereafter say Bring us another book besides this one or change it
Muhammad tell them I can not change it myself
I only follow what is revealed to me
I fear that for disobeying my Lord I shall be punished on the great Day of Judgment
Muhammad tell them Had God wanted I would not have recited it the Book to you nor would I have told you anything about it
I lived among you for a whole lifetime before it was revealed
Will you then not understand
Who is more unjust than one who invents falsehood against God or calls His revelations lies
The criminals will certainly have no happiness
Some people worship things other than God which harm nor benefit them They say These idols are our intercessors before God
Muhammad tell them Are you trying to tell God about something that He does not find in the heavens or earth
God is too Glorious to be considered equal to idols
All people once followed one belief
Then they began to follow different beliefs
Had not a word of your Lord His decision to give every one time and free will been decreed God would already have settled their differences
They unbelievers say Why has his Lord not given him some miracles to support his claim of being His Messenger
Say The knowledge of the unseen certainly belongs to God
Wait and I too shall be waiting with you
When people are granted mercy after having suffered hardship they begin to plot against Our revelations
Say God is the most swift in His plans
Our angelic messengers record all that you plot
When you are rejoicing in a boat a favorable breeze and a violent storm arises with waves surrounding you from all sides
Thinking that you will not survive you start to pray sincerely to God In prayer you say If You rescue us from this we shall certainly be grateful
When We saved you you started to rebel unjustly in the land
People your rebellion will only harm yourselves
You may enjoy the worldly life but to Us you will all return and We will let you know all that you had done
The example of the worldly life is like the water sent down from the sky which becomes mixed with the earth s produce that people and cattle consume
When the land becomes fertile and pleasant people think that they have control over it At Our command during the night or day the land becomes as barren as if it had no richness the day before
Thus do We explain the evidence of the truth for the people who reflect
God invites every one to the House of Peace and guides whomever He wants to the right path
The righteous will receive good reward for their deeds and more
Their faces will suffer no disgrace or ignominy
They will be the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever
The recompense for the evil deeds will be equally evil not more and the faces of the evildoers will suffer from disgrace
No one can protect them from the wrath of God
Their faces will become dark as if covered by the pitchdarkness of night
They will be the dwellers of hell wherein they will remain forever
We will tell the pagans on the day when every one is resurrected Stand with your idols wherever you are Then We will separate them from their idols and their idols will protest against them saying You did not worship us
God is Sufficient Witness for us that we were not aware of your worship
There every soul will experience the result of all that it had done They will be brought into the presence of God their true Lord and all that they falsely invented will vanish
Muhammad ask them Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and earth who truly possesses your hearing and seeing abilities who brings the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living and who regulates the whole Universe They will reply God Ask them Why then do you not have fear of Him
Thus is God your true Lord
In the absence of truth there is nothing but falsehood
Then where are you turning
The decree of your Lord that the evildoers will not have faith has already been issued
Muhammad ask them Can any of your idols create something cause it to die and then bring it back to life again
Say Only God can originate the creation and bring it to life again
Where have you strayed
Muhammad ask them Can any of your idols guide you to the Truth
Say Only God guides to the Truth
Is the one who guides to the Truth a proper guide or one who himself cannot find guidance unless he is guided by others
What is wrong with you that you judge so unjustly
Most of the unbelievers follow only conjecture which certainly cannot serve as a substitute for the Truth
God knows well what they do
No one could have composed this Quran besides God
This confirms the existing Book the Bible and explains itself
There is no doubt that it is from the Lord of the Universe
Do they say that Muhammad has invented it
Muhammad tell them If your claim is true compose only one chapter like it and call on anyone besides God for help
They call a lie something that is beyond the limit of their knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet been revealed
Some people who lived before them also called Our revelations lies
Consider how terrible was the end of the unjust people
Some of them believe in the Quran and others do not
Your Lord knows best the evil doers
If they call you a liar tell them Let each one of us follow his own way
You will not be responsible for what I do and I will not be responsible for what you do
Some of them will listen to you but are you supposed to make the deaf hear even if they have no understanding
Some of them will look at you but are you supposed to guide the blind even if they have no vision
God does not do the least bit of injustice to anyone but people wrong themselves
On the day when they will be resurrected their worldly life will seem to them only as an hour of a day and they all will recognize each other
Those who called the receiving of mercy from God a lie are certainly lost
They did not have the right guidance
When if We show you them suffering Our retribution or you die before their suffering they will not be able to escape Our punishment they will all return to Us
God bears witness to whatever they do
A Messenger is appointed for all people
When the Messenger for them came he judged among them fairly and they were not wronged
They ask If you believers speak the truth when will your promise about the Day of Judgment be fulfilled
Muhammad tell them I have no control over my suffering or benefits unless God wills
Every nation is destined to live for an appointed time
They can neither delay that time nor can they cause it to come sooner
Ask them What benefit can criminals get from their demand that God must punish them immediately if His words are true
Whether His punishment befalls them during the day or night they will not be able to escape
Besides if He was to send them the punishment which they want to quickly experience would they then have faith
The unjust will be told Suffer the everlasting torment
Do you expect a recompense other than what you deserve
They ask you Is that punishment true Tell them It certainly is
I swear by my Lord
You can not escape from God s retribution
On the Day of Judgment to redeem oneself of one s injustice one would gladly spend the wealth of the whole earth if it were possible
On seeing the torment one will try to hide his regret
They will all be judged fairly and no wrong will be done to them
All that is in the heavens and the earth certainly belongs to God and His promise is true but many people do not know this
It is God who gives life and causes things to die
To Him you will all return
People good advice has come to you from your Lord a spiritual cure a guide and a mercy for the believers
Muhammad tell them To be happy with the favors and mercy of God is better than whatever you accumulate
Ask them Have you considered that out of the sustenance which God has given you you made some of it lawful and some unlawful
Did God permit you to do this or are you ascribing falsehood to Him
What do those who ascribe falsehood to God think of the Day of Judgment
God is generous to the human being yet many do not give thanks
Muhammad We bear witness to all your affairs whatever you recite from the Quran and whatever you people do
Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from your Lord even that which is as small as an atom s weight or greater or smaller All is recorded in the glorious Book
The friends of God will certainly have nothing to fear nor will they be grieved
Those who have faith and fear God
will receive glad news both in this life and in the life hereafter
The words of God do not change
This alone is the supreme triumph
Muhammad let not their words disappoint you all dignity belongs to God
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Does not all that is in the heavens and the earth belong to God
The unbelievers who worship the idols instead of God follow only conjecture
What they preach are mere lies
It is God who has made the night for you to rest and has filled the day with light as a means of visibility
In this there is evidence of the existence of God for the people who hear
Some people have said that God has begotten a son
God is too Glorious to have a son
God is Selfsufficient and to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
In this you people have no authority
Do you ascribe to God things of which you have no knowledge
Muhammad tell them Those who invent falsehood against God will have no happiness
They may consider it a means of enjoyment in this life but on the Day of Judgment they will all return to Us Then they will suffer for their disbelief the most severe punishment
Muhammad tell them the story of Noah who told his people Even if my belief and my preaching of the revelation of God seem strange to you I put my trust in Him
Unite yourselves and seek help from your idols
You should not regret what you want to do but should execute your plans against me without delay
If you turn away from my preaching it will not harm me I shall receive my reward from God who has commanded me to become a Muslim
They rejected Noah
Then We saved him and his people in the Ark to make them the successors of the rest
The others who had called Our revelations lies were drowned
Consider the fate of those who rejected Our warnings
After Noah We sent other Messengers to their people with clear authoritative evidence proving their prophetic claims
But how could the people believe what they had previously called lies
Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors
Then We sent Moses and Aaron with Our miracles to the Pharaoh and his people
These people also proved to be arrogant They were wicked people
When the Truth from Us came they called it simply magic
Moses asked Why do you call the Truth which has come to you magic
Magicians certainly will not have happiness
They asked Moses Have you come to turn us away from the faith of our fathers and to make yourselves the rulers in the land
We shall never accept your faith
The Pharaoh ordered every skillful magician to come into his presence
When all the magicians were brought to his court Moses asked them to cast down what they wanted to
When the magicians had thrown theirs Moses said What you have performed is magic
God will certainly prove it to be false He will not make the deeds of the corrupt people righteous
God will make the Truth stand supreme by His words even though the wicked people dislike it
No one believed in Moses except some young people of his own tribe who were at the same time very afraid of the persecution of the Pharaoh and his people
The Pharaoh was certainly a tyrant and a transgressor
Moses told his people If you have submitted yourselves to God and have faith in Him put your trust in Him
They said In God do we trust
Lord do not subject us to the persecution of the unjust ones
Lord save us through Your mercy from the disbelieving people
We sent a revelation to Moses and his brother to build houses for their people in the Pharaoh s town and to build them facing one another We told him that therein they should pray and that Moses should give the glad news of God s mercy to the faithful ones
Moses said Lord You have given the Pharaoh and his people great riches and splendor in this life and this makes them stray from Your path Lord destroy their wealth and harden their hearts in disbelief so that they will suffer the most painful torment
The Lord replied Moses the prayer of your brother and yourself has been heard
Both of you must be steadfast in your faith and must not follow the ignorant ones
We helped the children of Israel cross the sea safely
The Pharaoh and his army pursued the children of Israel with wickedness and hate until the Pharaoh was drowned
As he was drowning the Pharaoh said I declare that there is no God but the One in whom the children of Israel believe and I have submitted to the Word of God
God replied Now you declare belief in Me but before this you were a disobedient rebel
We will save your body on this day so that you may become evidence of Our existence for the coming generations many people are unaware of such evidence
We settled the children of Israel in a blessed land and provided them with pure sustenance
They did not create differences among themselves until after the knowledge had come to them
God will judge their differences on the Day of Judgment
If you people have any doubt about what We have revealed to you about the Day of Judgment and other matters of belief ask those who read the Book that was revealed to the Prophets who lived before you
The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord
Thus do not doubt it in your heart
nor be of those who have called God s revelations lies lest you become lost
Even though all kinds of miracles will be shown to them those about whom the word of your Lord has been ordained will not have faith
until they face the most painful torment
Why did no one except the people of Jonah believe in their punishment before their death so that they could have benefitted from their faith
When the people of Jonah believed We saved them from a disgraceful torment in this life and provided them with the means of enjoyment for an appointed time
Had your Lord wished the whole of mankind would have believed in Him
Muhammad do you force people to have faith
No one can have faith without the permission of God
God will cast down filth on those who have no understanding
Muhammad tell them to consider that which is in the heavens and the earth
Evidence and warnings are of no avail to the disbelieving people
What can they expect other than the kind of punishment that befell the disbelieving people who had gone before them
Muhammad tell them Wait and I too will be waiting with you
We saved Our Messengers and those who believed We must save the believers
Muhammad say People if you have doubt about my religion know that I certainly do not worship the idols which you worship instead of God but I worship God who causes you to die I am commanded to believe in His existence
to have firm belief in the upright religion and not to be an idolater
nor to seek help from anyone other than God who can neither benefit nor harm me lest I become of the unjust
Muhammad if God afflicts you with hardship no one besides Him can save you
If God grants you a favor no one can prevent you from receiving His favors
God bestows His favors upon whichever of His servants He wants
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Muhammad say People truth has certainly come to you from your Lord
One who seeks guidance does so for his own good and One who goes astray will find himself lost
I am not your keeper
Muhammad follow what is revealed to you and have patience until God issues His Judgment He is the best Judge
Alif Lam
This is a Book from One who is Allwise and Allaware Its verses are well composed and distinctly arranged from one another
It teaches People do not worship anyone besides God
I Muhammad am His Messenger sent to warn you and to give you the glad news
Seek forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him in repentance for your sins
He will provide you good sustenance for an appointed time and will reward everyone according to his merits
I am afraid that you will suffer torment on the great Day of Judgment if you turn away from God
To God you will all return
God has power over all things
The unbelievers cover their breasts to try to hide their disbelief from God
But He knows very well whatever they conceal or reveal even when they cover themselves with their garments
God certainly knows the innermost secrets of the hearts
There is no living creature on earth that does not receive sustenance from God He knows its dwelling and resting place
Everything is recorded in the glorious Book
God created the heavens and the earth in six days His Throne existed on water so that He could test you and find out those among you who do good deeds
Muhammad if you were to tell them that after death they would be brought back to life again the unbelievers would say This is nothing but obvious magic
If We delay in afflicting them with Our punishment for an appointed time they ask What is preventing it the punishment from taking place
On the day when it punishment befalls them no one will be able to escape from it and that which they have mocked will surround them from all sides
We grant a favor to the human being and then take it away from him He becomes despairing and ungrateful
If after his hardship We grant him a blessing he grows proud and rejoicing and says All my hardships have gone
But those who exercise patience and do good works do not behave as such
They will receive forgiveness and a great reward from the Lord
Perhaps you Muhammad may by chance leave untold a part of that which is revealed to you and feel grieved because they say Why has some treasure not been sent to him or an angel sent down with him
Say I have come only to warn you
God is the Guardian of all things
Do they the unbelievers say that Muhammad has falsely ascribed the Quran to God
Ask them Compose ten chapters like those of the Quran and call on whomever you can for help besides God if you are true in your claim
If they will not respond to you know that God has sent it with His knowledge and that He is the only God
Will you then become Muslims
Those who choose the worldly life and its pleasures will be given proper recompense for their deeds in this life and will not suffer any loss
Such people will receive nothing in the next life except Hell fire
Their deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and their efforts will be in vain
Should they be compared with those whose Lord has given them a guidance which is testified by a witness from among their own people and by the Book of Moses a guide and a mercy
Such people do believe in this guidance in the Quran
Those who disbelieve in the Quran will have hell as their dwelling place
Thus Muhammad have no doubt about it the Quran
It is certainly the truth from your Lord yet many people do not have faith
Who are more unjust than those who ascribe falsehood to God
When such people are brought into the presence of their Lord the witness will say These are the ones who told lies about their Lord
Certainly God will condemn the unjust
who prevent others from the way of God seek to make it appear crooked and who have no faith in the life hereafter
Such people will never weaken God s power on earth nor will they find any guardian besides God
Their punishment will be doubled and they will not be able to hear or see
They have lost their souls and their false deities will turn away from them
In the life to come they will certainly lose a great deal
The righteously striving believers who are humble before their Lord will be the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever
Can the two groups the blind and the deaf be considered equal to those who have vision and hearing
Will you then not take heed
We sent Noah to his people to give them the clear warning
that they should not worship anyone besides God
Noah warned them I am afraid that you will suffer the most painful torment
The disbelievers among his people said We do not believe that you are any better than the rest of us we see that only the worthless hasty ones the lowliest among us follow you
Thus we do not think that you are superior to us rather you are all liars
Noah replied My people do you think that if my Lord has sent me a miracle and granted me mercy but your ignorance has obscured them from your sight we can force you to believe when you do not want to
My people I do not ask any payment for what I preach to you
No one except God has to give me any reward
I do not drive away those who have faith in my teaching they will all receive mercy from their Lord
I know that you are ignorant people
My people who would protect me against God if I were to drive these people away
Will you then not take heed
I do not say that God s treasures belong to me that I know the unseen or that I am an angel
Nor do I say about those whom you disdain that God will not give them any reward
God knows best what is in their hearts for then I would be unjust
They said Noah you have argued with us a great deal
Bring down on us whatever torment with which you have been threatening us if what you say is true
Noah replied God will bring torment down on you whenever He wants and you will not be able to make His plans fail
My advice will be of no benefit to you if God wants to let you go astray
He is your Lord and to Him you will all return
Do they say that Muhammad has falsely ascribed the Quran to God
Muhammad tell them Had I falsely ascribed it to God I shall be responsible for my own sins
I am certainly not responsible for whatever sins you commit
It was revealed to Noah that besides those who had already accepted his faith no one from his people would ever believe him
He was told not to be disappointed about what his people had done
but to build the Ark under the supervision and guidance of his Lord He was also told not to address any words to Him concerning the unjust for they were all to be drowned
Noah started to build the Ark but whenever some of his people passed by they would mock him
He in return would reply Mock us but just as you mock us we too will mock you
You will soon learn who will face a humiliating punishment and will be encompassed by an everlasting torment
When at last Our decree was fulfilled water gushed forth from the Oven in Noah s house We told him to carry in the Ark a pair male and female from every species his family except those who were destined to perish and the believers
No one believed in him except a few
Noah said Embark in it
It will sail in the name of God in His Name it will sail and in His Name it will cast anchor
My Lord is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When the Ark sailed on with them amid the mountainous waves Noah called out to his son who kept away from them My son embark with us
Do not stay with the unbelievers
His son replied I shall climb up a mountain and this will save me from the flood
Noah said No one can escape on this day from God s command except those on whom He has mercy
The waves separated Noah from his son who was then drowned with the rest of the unbelievers
Then the earth was told to swallowup its water and the sky was ordered to stop raining
The water abated and God s command had been fulfilled
The Ark came to rest on Mount Judi
A voice said The unjust people are far away from the mercy of God
Noah prayed to his Lord saying Lord my son is a member of my family
Your promise is always true and you are the best Judge
His Lord replied He is not one of your family
He is a man of unrighteous deeds
Do not ask me about that which you have no knowledge
I advise you not to become an ignorant person
Noah said Lord I ask You to prevent me from asking You ignorant questions and beg you for pardon and mercy or else I shall certainly be lost
Noah was told Get down from the Ark
Your Lord s peace and blessings are upon you and your followers
Your Lord will grant favors to other nations and then afflict them with a painful torment
That which We have revealed to you Muhammad is news of the unseen
This was not known to you and to your people
Have patience
The pious will triumph in the end
To the tribe of Ad We sent their brother Hud who told them Worship God He is your only Lord The idols that you worship are plainly false
My people I do not ask any reward for what I have preached to you
No one can give me my reward except my Creator
Will you then not take heed
My people seek forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him in repentance
He will send you abundant rain from the sky and will increase your power
Do not sinfully turn away from Him
They said Hud you have not shown us any miracles
We shall not give up our idols because of what you say and we shall not have any faith in you
We believe that some of our gods have afflicted you with evil
Hud said God is my witness and so are you that I have no association
with the idols that you worship besides God
So plan against me without delay
I trust God who is my Lord as well as yours It is God who controls the destiny of all living creatures It is my Lord who knows the right path
If you turn away from Him since I have already preached to you the message that I carry He will replace you with another nation
You cannot harm Him the least
My Lord is the Protector of all things
When Our decree of destroying them was fulfilled We mercifully saved Hud and his believing followers We saved them from the intense torment
It was the tribe of Ad who denied the miracles of their Lord disobeyed His Messenger and followed the orders of every transgressing tyrant
They were condemned in this life and will be condemned in the life hereafter
The tribe of Ad had certainly rejected their Lord
God kept the tribe of Ad the people of Hud away from His mercy
To Thamud We sent their brother Salih who told them My people worship God He is your only Lord
It is He who has created you from the earth and has settled you therein
Seek forgiveness from Him and turn to Him in repentance
My Lord is certainly close to everyone and He hears all prayers
They said Salih we had great hope in you before this
Do you forbid us to worship that which our fathers had worshipped
We are doubtful and uncertain about what you have told us to worship
He said My people think
I have received authoritative evidence and mercy from my Lord so who will protect me from God if I disobey Him
You certainly want to destroy me
My people this is the shecamel of God a miracle to support the truth which has been brought to you
Leave her to graze in the land of God Do not harm her with your evil deeds lest torment will suddenly strike you
When they slew the shecamel Salih told them You have only three days to enjoy living in your homes before you will be struck by the torment
This is an inevitable prophecy
When Our decree came to pass We mercifully saved Salih and his faithful followers from that day s ignominy
Your Lord is certainly Mighty and Majestic
A blast struck the unjust and they were found lying motionless on their faces
as though they had never existed
The people of Thamud denied the existence of their Lord
How distant from the mercy of God had the people of Thamud gone
Our Messengers came to Abraham with glad news They said Peace be with you
He replied similarly After a short time he presented them with a roasted calf
but when he saw that their hands did not reach out for it he could not know who they were and became afraid of them
They said Do not be afraid we are God s angelic Messengers sent to the people of Lot
His wife who was standing nearby smiled and so We gave her the glad news that she would give birth to Isaac who would have a son Jacob
She said Woe is me
How can I have a baby when I am barren and my husband is very old
This is certainly strange
They replied Would you be surprised at God s decree
People of the house may God s mercy and blessings be with you
God is Appreciative and Glorious
When Abraham had controlled his fear and received the glad news he started to plead with Us for the people of Lot
Abraham was certainly a forbearing compassionate and tenderhearted person
We said Abraham avoid asking Us such questions
Your Lord s decree has already been issued and an inevitable torment will strike these people
When Our Messengers came to Lot he became sorrowful and felt totally helpless He said This is indeed a distressful day
His people who had constantly indulged in evil deeds came running to him
He said My people here are my pure daughters
Have fear of God and do not humiliate me before my guests
Is there no person of understanding among you
They said You certainly know that we have no right to your daughters and you know what we want
He said Would that I had the power to overcome you or could seek strong protection
Our Messengers said Lot we are the Messengers of your Lord
They will never harm you
Leave the town with your family in the darkness of night and do not let any of you turn back
As for your wife she will suffer what they unbelievers will suffer
Their appointed time will come at dawn
Surely dawn is not far away
When Our decree came to pass We turned the town upsidedown and showered unto it lumps of baked clay
marked by your Lord
Such a punishment is not far away from the unjust people
To the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu ayb who told them My people worship God He is your only Lord Do not be dishonest in your weighing and measuring I can see you are safe and prosperous but I am afraid for you of the overwhelming torment of the appointed day
My people be just in your weighing and measuring
Do not defraud people or spread evil in the land
If you are true believers then know that the profit which God has left for you is better for you than what you may gain through deceitful ways
I am not responsible for your deeds
They asked him Shu ayb do your prayers tell you that we must give up the worship of what our fathers had worshipped and that we must not deal with our properties as we like
We still believe that you are a person of forbearance and understanding
He said My people do you not realize that I have received authoritative evidence from my Lord and have been granted a noble gift from Him
I do not want to oppose or ignore what I have prohibited you not to do
I only intend to reform you as much as I can
My success is in the hands of God
I trust Him and turn to Him in repentance
My people do not let your opposition to me lead you to commit sins or make you suffer what the people of Noah Hud and Salih suffered
Remember that the people of Lot were destroyed not very long ago
Seek forgiveness from your Lord and turn to Him in repentance
My Lord is certainly Allmerciful and Loving
They said Shu ayb we do not understand much of what you say but we know that you are weak among us
Had it not been for our respect of your tribe we would have stoned you to death you are not very dear to us
He asked them My people is my tribe more respectable to you than God whom you have completely ignored
My Lord certainly has full control over your deeds
My people do as you wish and I will do as I believe
You will soon know who will suffer a humiliating torment and who was the one telling lies
Wait and I too will be waiting with you
When Our decree came to pass We mercifully saved Shu ayb and his faithful followers
A blast struck the unjust and left them in their homes lying motionless on their faces
as though they had never existed
How far from the mercy of God had the people of Midian gone just as those of Thamud
We sent Moses to the Pharaoh and his nobles with Our miracles and a clear authority
They followed the order of the Pharaoh but Pharaoh s orders were evil
On the Day of Judgment he will lead his people down into the hell fire His leadership is evil and terrible is the place to which he leads
They are condemned in this world and in the life to come
Evil is the gift and the recipient
Such were the stories of the nations of the past which We tell to you Muhammad
Some of them were destroyed and some of them have survived
We were not unjust to them but they were unjust to themselves
The idols which they worshipped instead of God were of no help to them when Our decree came to pass The idols only brought about their destruction
Thus was the punishment of your Lord when He punished the unjust people of the towns
The punishment of your Lord is certainly severe
In this there is certainly a lesson for those who fear the torment of the next life in which all people will be gathered together
during a single day We have deferred this day for an appointed time
On the Day of Judgment no one will speak without the permission of God
Some will be condemned and others blessed
The condemned ones will live in hell fire sighing and groaning
for as long as the heavens and the earth exist unless your Lord decides otherwise
Your Lord will certainly accomplish whatever He wants
The blessed ones will live in Paradise as long as the heavens and the earth exist unless your Lord decides to grant endless rewards to whomever He wants
Have no doubt that these people worship idols
They worship what their fathers had worshipped before them
We will give them the exact recompense that they deserve
We gave the Book to Moses but people had different views about it
Had the Word of your Lord not been already ordained He would have settled their differences there and then
They are still in doubt about this
God will certainly recompense everyone according to their deeds He knows well all that you do
Muhammad be steadfast in your faith just as you have been commanded
Those who have turned to God in repentance with you should also be steadfast in their faith
Do not indulge in rebellion God is certainly aware of what you do
Do not be inclined towards the unjust ones lest you will be afflicted by the hell fire
Besides God no one can be your protector nor will anyone be able to help you
Say your prayers in the morning the last portion of the day and at the beginning of the night
Good deeds do away with the bad deeds
This is a reminder for those who take heed
Exercise patience God does not ignore the reward of those who do good
Why were there no people of understanding among those people of the destroyed towns of the past except for a few whom we saved from destruction to prevent people from committing evil in the land
The unjust among them indulged in worldly pleasures and so became guilty
Your Lord would not have destroyed those people of the towns for their injustice if they had tried to reform themselves
Had your Lord wanted He would have made all people one united nation
They still have different beliefs
except those upon whom God has granted His mercy
God has created them to receive mercy
The decree of your Lord that He will fill hell with both jinn and human beings has already been ordained
Muhammad We tell you all the stories of the Messengers which will strengthen your heart
In the Quran We have revealed the Truth to you with good advice and reminders for the faithful ones
Tell the unbelievers Do as you wish and I will do as I believe
Wait and I too will be waiting with you
To God belongs the knowledge of the unseen in the heavens and the earth and to Him do all affairs return
Worship Him and trust Him
Your Lord is not unaware of what you do
Alif Lam
Ra These are the verses of the illustrious Book
We have revealed it in the Arabic language so that you people would understand it
In revealing this Quran to you We tell you the best of the stories of which you were unaware
When Joseph said Father in my dream I saw eleven stars the sun and the moon prostrating before me
his father said My son do not tell your dream to your brothers lest they plot against you satan is the sworn enemy of man
Thus your Lord will select you teach you the interpretation of dreams and grant His favors to you and the family of Jacob just as He granted His favors to your fathers Abraham and Isaac
Your Lord is certainly Allknowing and Allwise
In the story of Joseph and his brothers there is evidence of the truth for those who seek to know
Joseph s brothers said to one another There is no doubt that Joseph and his brother are more loved by our father even though we are all his offspring
He our father is certainly in manifest error
Some of them suggested Let us kill Joseph or leave him somewhere far away from the presence of our father
Only then shall we receive equal treatment and thereafter can become righteous people
One of them said Do not kill Joseph but if you must throw him into a dark well so that perhaps some caravan will take him away
Then they asked their father Why do you not trust us with Joseph We are his wellwishers
Send him with us tomorrow to play with us and enjoy himself
We shall carefully protect him
Jacob replied I shall be grieved if you take him with you I fear that some wildbeast will harm him in your absence
They said If some wildbeast would be able to harm him despite the presence of our strong group it would certainly be a great loss to us
When they took Joseph with them they agreed to throw him into the well
We revealed to Joseph that sometime in the future at a time when they would not recognize him he would remind them of all this
In the evening they returned to their father weeping
and saying Father we went playing and left Joseph with our belongings A wildbeast came and devoured him
We realize that you will not believe us even though we are telling the truth
They presented him with a shirt stained with false blood
Jacob said Your souls have tempted you in this matter
Let us be patient and beg assistance from God if what you say is true
A caravan came by and sent their water carrier out to the well
When he drew out Joseph in his bucket he shouted Glad news a young boy
The people of the caravan hid him amongst their belongings
God knows well what they do
In selling him they asked for a very small price and even then no one wanted to buy him
The Egyptian who bought him said to his wife Be kind to him perhaps he will be of some benefit to us or we may adopt him
Thus We settled Joseph in the land so that We could teach him the interpretation of dreams
God has full control over His affairs but most people do not know
When he attained maturity God gave him strength wisdom and knowledge
Thus do We reward those who do good
His master s wife then tried to seduce him
She locked the doors and said to him Come on
He said I seek refuge in God who has given me a good place of shelter
The unjust will certainly have no happiness
She was determined to have him and were it not for his faith in God he would certainly have yielded to her
Thus did We protect him from evil and indecency
He was certainly one of Our sincere servants
She chased him to the door grabbed him from behind and tore off his shirt
Suddenly they were face to face with her husband
Looking accusingly at Joseph she asked her husband What punishment is more fitting for those who have evil desires towards your household other than imprisonment and painful torment
Joseph said It was she who tried to seduce me
Someone from the household in confirmation of Joseph s statement said If his shirt it torn from the front she has spoken the truth and he is lying
but if his shirt is torn from behind she is lying and he is speaking the truth
When the master saw that Joseph s shirt was torn from behind he told his wife This is some of your womanly guile in which you are certainly skillful
Joseph stay away from such affairs and you woman ask forgiveness for your sin the guilt is yours
Some of the women in the town started to gossip saying The King s wife has tried to seduce her servant and has fallen madly in love with him
We think that she is in manifest error
When she heard their gossiping she invited them to her house for a banquet and gave a knife to each of them
Then she told Joseph to appear before them
When they saw Joseph they were so amazed that they cut their hands and said Goodness gracious
He is not a mortal but is a charming angel
She said This is the one on whose account you subjected me to all this blame
I tried to seduce him but he abstained
If he does not yield to me I shall order him to be locked up in prison to make him humble
Joseph said Lord prison is dearer to me than that which women want me to do
Unless You protect me from their guile I shall be attracted to them in my ignorance
His Lord heard his prayers and protected him from their guile He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Even after Joseph had been found innocent of any crime the King and his people decided to imprison him for an appointed time so that people would forget the incident
Two young men were also sent to serve prison sentences for different reasons One of them said I had a dream in which I was brewing wine
The other one said In my dream I was carrying some bread on my head and birds were eating that bread
They asked Joseph if he would interpret their dreams
They said We believe you to be a righteous person
Joseph said To prove that my interpretation of your dream is true I can tell you what kind of food you will receive even before it comes to you
My Lord has given me such talents
I have given up the tradition of the people who do not believe in God and the Day of Judgment
and I have embraced the religion of my fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob
We are not supposed to consider anything equal to God
This is part of God s blessing to us and the people but most people do not give thanks
My fellowprisoners can many different masters be considered better than One Alldominant God
What you worship instead of God are no more than empty names that you and your fathers have given to certain things
God has not given any authority to such names
Judgment belongs to no one but God
He has commanded you to worship nothing but Him
This is the only true religion but most people do not know
Fellowprisoners your dreams tell that one of you will serve wine to his master and the other will be crucified and his head consumed by the birds
Judgment has already been passed about the meaning of the dreams that you asked about
Joseph asked the one whom he knew would not be executed to mention his case to his Lord
Satan caused that man to forget all about Joseph and his case Thus Joseph remained in prison for some years
Sometimes later the King dreamt that seven lean cows were eating seven fat ones and that there were seven green ears of corn and seven dry ones
He asked the nobles to tell him the meaning of his dream if they were able to
They replied It is a confused dream and we do not know the meaning of such dreams
The man who was in prison with Joseph and who was released recalled after so many years Joseph s ability to interpret dreams and said I can tell you the meaning of this dream if you allow me to go to the prison and ask the man who knows the meanings of dreams
He went to the prison and said to Joseph You are a man of truth
Would you tell me the meaning of a dream in which seven fat cows eat up seven lean ones and the meaning of seven green ears of corn and seven dry ones
I hope you can tell me the right meaning and save people from confusion
Joseph said Cultivate your lands for seven years as usual and preserve the produce with its ears each year except the little amount that you will consume
After this will ensue seven years of famine in which all the grain that you have stored will be consumed except a small quantity
Then there will be a year with plenty of rain and people will have sufficient milk and other produce
The King ordered his people to bring Joseph into his presence
When the messenger came to Joseph he Joseph said Ask your master about the women who cut their hands
My Lord knows all about their guile
The King asked the women about their attempt to seduce Joseph
They replied God forbid
We do not know of any bad in Joseph
The wife of the King said Now the truth has come to light
It was I who tried to seduce Joseph
He is certainly a truthful man
Joseph said This proves that I was not disloyal to the King in his absence God does not grant success to the efforts of disloyal people
I do not think that I am free from weakness all human souls are susceptible to evil except for those to whom my Lord has granted mercy
My Lord is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
The King ordered his men to bring Joseph before him
He wanted to grant him a high office The King said to Joseph From now on you will be an honored and trusted person among us
Joseph said Put me in charge of the treasuries of the land I know how to manage them
Thus We settled Joseph in the land to live wherever he wanted
We grant a due share of Our mercy to whomever We want and We do not ignore the reward of the righteous ones
The reward in the next life is certainly better for the faithful ones who have observed piety in this life
Joseph s brothers came to him When they entered his court he recognized them
They did not know him
When he had furnished them with provisions he said Next time bring me your other brother from your father
As you can see I give each of you a certain amount of grain I am a polite host
If you do not bring him do not come to us for we shall not give you any more grain
Joseph s brothers said We shall try to influence his father to send him with us and we shall be successful
Then Joseph told his people to put his brothers money back into their bags so that perhaps they would recognize it when at home and come back to Egypt once again
When they returned to their father they told him Father unless we take our brother they will refuse us one further measure of grain
Send our brother with us so that we can obtain that measure
We shall watch over him carefully
Jacob replied How can I trust you after what happened to his brother before Only God is the best Protector
His mercy is far greater than that of others
When they opened their baggage they found that their money had been returned to them
They said Father what more do we want
Our money has been given back to us
We can buy more provisions with this for our family We shall protect our brother and have one more camel load of grain which is easy to get
Jacob said I shall not send him with you until you solemnly promise me before God to return him to me unless you are prevented from doing so
When they gave their promise he said God is the Witness of what we have said
Jacob then told his sons Do not enter the town all together by a single gate but each of you enter separately
I cannot help you against the decree of God
Everyone s destiny is in His hands
I put my trust in Him
Whoever needs a trustee must put his trust in God
Even though they entered the town as their father had told them it would not have been of any avail to them against the decree of God
It only served to satisfy Jacob s desire and judgment
He was certainly well versed by Our instruction but most people do not know
When they entered Joseph s court he gave lodging to his own brother Benjamin and said I am your brother
Do not feel sad about whatever they had done
When he had furnished them with provisions he placed the King s drinking cup in his own brother s baggage
Then someone shouted People of the caravan you are thieves
Joseph s brothers turned around and asked What is missing
They were told The King s drinking cup is missing and whoever brings it will receive a camel s load of grain
I promise you that
Joseph s brothers said We swear by God as you know that we have not come to spread evil in the land and that we have not committed any theft
The Egyptians said What do you suggest should be the punishment for the thief if it is proved that you are lying
Joseph s brothers replied In whosoever baggage it is found that person will be your bondsman
Thus is the punishment of the unjust
They searched their baggage before that of Joseph s real brother where at last they found it
Thus We showed Joseph how to plan this he would not have been able to take his brother under the King s law unless God had wanted it to be so
We give a high rank to whomever We want
Over every knowledgeable person is one more knowing
Joseph s brothers said It s no wonder that he steals a brother of his had stolen before him
Joseph noted their remarks but did not utter a word
He said to himself You are in a worse position God knows best what you allege
They said Noble Prince his father is very old so please take one of us in his place
We believe that you are a righteous person
He replied God forbid
How could I take someone in place of the thief
In doing so I would be committing injustice
When they lost all hope of convincing the Prince they moved into a corner whispering to each other
The eldest among them said Do you not remember that you had solemnly promised our father to return Benjamin to him and that before this you had broken your promise concerning Joseph
I shall never leave this land until my father gives me permission or God decides for me He is the best Judge
Go to our father and tell him Father your son committed theft We say only what we have seen and we have no control over the unseen
You can ask the people of the town where we were and the caravan we met there
We are certainly telling the truth
When he heard this Jacob said Your souls have tempted you to make up the whole story Let us be patient for perhaps God will bring them all back to me God is certainly Allknowing and Allwise
Jacob turned away from them saying Alas Joseph is lost
He wept continuously in his grief until in suppressing his anger his eyes turned white
They said You are always remembering Joseph By God it will either make you sick or you will die
He replied I only complain of my sorrow and grief to God I know about God what you do not know
My sons go and search for Joseph and his brother and do not despair of receiving comfort from God only the unbelievers despair of receiving comfort from Him
When they entered Joseph s court they said Noble Prince hardship has struck us and our people
We have come with a little money so give us a measure of grain and be charitable to us
God will give the reward to those who give charity
Joseph asked them Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance
Then they inquired Are you Joseph
He said Yes I am Joseph and this is my brother
God has indeed been gracious to us
One who exercises patience and observes piety should know that God does not ignore the reward of the righteous ones
They said We swear by God that He has given preference to you over us and we have sinned
Joseph said No one will blame you on this day God will forgive you He is more Merciful than others
Take my shirt and place it unto my father s face This will restore his eyesight
Then bring the whole family to me
When the caravan left the town their father said I smell Joseph s scent I hope that you will not accuse me of senility
His people said By God you are still making the same old error
When someone brought him the glad news Joseph s shirt was placed on his face and his eyesight was restored he said Did I not tell you that I know about God that which you do not know
They said Father ask God to forgive our sins we have certainly sinned
He said I shall ask my Lord to forgive you He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
When they all came to Joseph he welcomed his parents and said Enter the town in peace if God wants it to be so
He raised his parents on the throne and they prostrated themselves before him Joseph
He said This is the meaning of my dream which God has made come true
He has granted me many favors
He set me free from prison and brought you to me from the desert after having ended the enmity which satan sowed between my brothers and I My Lord is certainly kind to whomever He wants
It is He who is Allforgiving and Allwise
My Lord You have given me the kingdom and taught me the meaning of dreams
You are the Creator of the heavens and the earth
You are my Guardian in this world and in the life to come
Make me die as one who has submitted to the Will of God and unite me with the righteous ones
This is some of the news of the unseen which We reveal to you Muhammad
You were not with them when Joseph s brothers agreed on devising their evil plans
However hard you try most people will not believe
You do not ask any reward for your preaching of Our guidance to them
This Quran is a guide for the people of the world human beings and jinn
There is much evidence of the existence of God in the heavens and the earth which they see but ignore
Most of them do not believe in God they are but pagans
Do they feel safe from God s overwhelming torment or of the sudden approach of the Day of Judgment while they are unaware
Muhammad say This is my way
I and all my followers invite you to God with proper understanding
God is most Glorious
I am not a pagan
The Messengers whom We sent before you were mere men of the people of the towns We gave them revelations
Have they the unbelievers not travelled sufficiently through the land to see how terrible the end was of those who lived before
The next life is certainly better for the pious ones
Will you not then take heed
When at last the Messengers lost all hope of achieving success in their task and thought that everyone had called them liars We gave them victory and saved whomever We chose to save
The guilty ones can not escape Our wrath
In their story there is a lesson for the people of understanding
It is not a legend but a confirmation of what exists in the Torah It the Quran has details about everything
It is a guide and mercy for those who have faith
Alif Lam
Ra These are the verses of the Book
Whatever is revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth but most people do not believe
God is the One Who raised the heavens without a pillar as you can see Then He established his control over the realm and made the sun and moon subservient to Him
Each of them will remain in motion for an appointed time He regulates all affairs and explains the evidence of His existence so that perhaps you will be certain of your meeting with your Lord
It is God who spread out the earth and fixed mountains and placed rivers therein He made a pair of every fruit and made the night cover the day
All this is evidence of the existence of God for the people who think
In the earth there are adjacent pieces of land vineyards farms datepalms of single and many roots which are all watered by the same water
We have made some yield a better food than others
All this is evidence of the existence of God for the people who understand
If there is anything to make you wonder it would be the words of those who say When we become dust shall we be brought back to life again
They are disbelievers in their Lord and will wear heavy fetters around their necks
They are the dwellers of the hell fire wherein they will live forever
They ask you to bring upon them punishment before they ask you for mercy
Such punishments were already brought upon the people who lived before them
Your Lord certainly has forgiveness for the injustice of the people
He is also stern in His retribution
The unbelievers say Why has God not sent him Muhammad some miracles
Muhammad you are only a warner
For every nation there is a guide
God knows well what every female conceives
He knows what the wombs spoil and dispose of
In His plans everything has been designed proportionately
He knows all the unseen and seen
He is the most Great and High
It is all the same to Him whether you speak in secret or out loud try to hide in the darkness of night or walk in the brightness of day
Everyone is guarded and protected on all sides by the order of God
God does not change the condition of a nation unless it changes what is in its heart
When God wants to punish a people there is no way to escape from it and no one besides God will protect them from it
It is God who flashes lightning to frighten you and to give you hope It is He who forms the heavy clouds
Both the thunder and the angels glorify Him and out of His fear always praise Him
He sends down thunderbolts to strike whomever He wants while they are busy arguing about the existence of God
His punishment is stern
Prayer to Him is the true prayer
Those to whom they pray instead of God will answer none of their prayers
It is as though one stretches his hands out to the water that can never reach his mouth
The prayers of the unbelievers will get nowhere
All in the heavens and the earth prostrate themselves before God either of their own free will or by force just as do their shadows in the mornings and evenings
Muhammad ask them Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth
Say It is God
Ask them Why then have you taken guardians other than God when such guardians can neither benefit nor harm themselves
Ask them Are the seeing and the blind equal Is light equal to darkness
Do they consider that their idols have created anything like that of God thus both creations appear to them to be alike
Say God alone is the Creator of all things and He is the One the AllDominant
When God sends down water from the sky and floods run through the valleys certain quantities of foam rise on the surface of the flood water
This is similar to that foam which rises when you expose something to the heat of a fire to manufacture ornaments or for other reasons
To God Truth and falsehood are like these examples
The foam disappears but what is profitable to the human being stays in the land
Thus does God coin His parables
Those who answer the call of their Lord will receive good rewards
Whatever those who have not answered the call of their Lord offer to redeem themselves even if they offer double the wealth of the whole earth will not be accepted
They will face a terrible reckoning and their dwelling will be hell a terrible place to rest
Can a person who knows that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth be considered equal to a blind person
Only those who have understanding take heed
Those who fulfill their promise to and covenant with God
who maintain all the proper relations that God has commanded them to maintain who have fear of their Lord and the hardships of the Day of Judgment
who exercise patience to gain God s pleasure who are steadfast in prayer who spend for the cause of God privately and in public and who keep away evil with good will have a blissful end
They will be admitted to the gardens of Eden wherein they will live forever with their righteous fathers spouses and offspring
The angels will come to them through every gate
saying Peace be with you for all that you have patiently endured
Blessed is the reward of Paradise
Those who disregard their covenant with God after He has taken such a pledge from them who sever the proper relations that God has commanded them to establish and those who spread evil in the land will have God s condemnation instead of reward and will face the most terrible end
God gives abundant sustenance to whomever He wants and determines everyone s destiny
Some people are very happy with the worldly life Compared to the life to come it is only a temporary means
The unbelievers say Why have not some miracles been sent to him Muhammad from his Lord
Say God causes whomever He wants to go astray and He guides those who turn to Him in repentance
and the faithful ones whose hearts are comforted by the remembrance of God
Remembrance of God certainly brings comfort to all hearts
The righteously striving believers will receive abundant blessings and the best eternal dwelling
We have sent you to a nation before whom there lived many nations so that you would read to them what We have revealed to you
They still deny the existence of the Beneficent God
Say He is my Lord besides whom there is no other God
I trust Him and turn to Him in repentance
Even if the Quran would make mountains move cut the earth into pieces and make the dead able to speak the unbelievers still would not believe
All affairs are in the hands of God
Do the believers still hope that they will believe
Had God wanted he could have guided the whole of mankind to the right path
The unbelievers will always suffer afflictions that result from their deeds or the affliction which occur near their homes until God s promise of punishing them will be fulfilled
God does not disregard His promise
Muhammad people have mocked the Messengers who lived before you
I gave a respite to the unbelievers so that they would repent but they did not
Then I struck them with a terrible retribution
Can anyone be considered equal to the One who is the Guardian of every soul and the Watcher of what it has gained
Yet the unbelievers have considered their idols equal to God
Say Name the attributes of your idols
Are you trying to tell God about something that does not exist on the earth
Do you only mention empty names
Evil plans have attracted the unbelievers and have misled them from the right path
No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray
The unbelievers will face torment in this world and their punishment in the life hereafter will be even greater
No one can save them from the wrath of God
The gardens which have been promised to the pious have flowing streams everlasting fruits and perpetual shade
Such is the blissful end of the pious but hell fire is the terrible end for the unbelievers
The People of the Book are happy with what has been revealed to you
Among the different parties there are some who dislike part of what has been revealed to you
Muhammad tell them I have been commanded to worship God alone not to consider anything equal to Him
To Him do I pray and to Him shall I return
We revealed it the Quran as a code of conduct in the Arabic language
Muhammad if you follow their desires after the knowledge has been revealed to you know that no one will be able to guard or protect you from the wrath of God
We sent Messengers before you Muhammad and gave them wives and offspring No Messenger was to show miracles without the permission of God
For every event God has ordained His decree God establishes or effaces whatever He wants and with Him is the original of the Book
Whether We show them the unbelievers to you facing the punishment with which We had threatened them or make you die first before its fulfillment your duty is only to preach
It is up to Us to call them to account for their deeds
Have they not considered that We have taken over the land and reduced its borders
It is God who issues the irreversible decree and His reckoning is swift
Certain people who lived before plotted evil plans but God is the Master of all plans
He knows what every soul does
The unbelievers will soon learn who will achieve the blissful end
Muhammad the unbelievers say You are not a Messenger
Say God and those who have the knowledge of the Book are sufficient witness to my prophethood
Alif
Lam Ra
A Book has been revealed to you Muhammad so that by the permission of their Lord you would be able to lead people from darkness into light along the path of the Majestic Praised One
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth
Woe to the disbelievers they will face the most severe punishment
It is they who have given preference to the worldly life over the life to come They create obstacles in the way that leads to God and try to make it seem crooked
They are in manifest error
All the Messengers that We sent spoke the language of their people so that they could explain their message to them
God guides or causes to go astray whomever He wants
He is Majestic and Allwise
We sent Moses and gave him miracles in order to lead his people from darkness into light and to remind them of the days of God
In this there is evidence of the truth for those who exercise patience and give thanks
Moses told his people Remember the favors that God granted you when He saved you from the people of the Pharaoh who had punished you in the worst manner by murdering your sons and keeping your women alive
It was a great trial for you from your Lord
Remember when your Lord said to you If you give thanks I shall give you greater favors but if you deny the Truth know that My retribution is severe
Moses told his people If you and everyone on the earth turn to disbelief know that God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
Have you believers ever heard the news about those who lived before you like the people of Noah Ad Thamud and those who lived after them
No one knows about them except God
Messengers were sent to them with miracles but they put their hands to their mouths and said We do not believe in whatever you preach and we are also doubtful and uncertain about that to which you invite us
The Messengers asked them Could there be any doubt about the existence of God who has created the heavens and the earth He calls you to Himself to forgive your sins
He gives you respite only until the appointed time
They said You are mere mortals like us
What you want is to prevent us from worshipping that which our fathers worshipped Show us clear proof if what you say is true
The Messengers replied We are certainly mere mortals like you but God bestows His favors on whichever of His servants He wants
We can not bring you authority without the permission of God
The faithful should trust in God alone
Why should we not trust in God when He has shown us the right way
We shall exercise patience against the troubles with which you afflict us
Whoever needs a trustee should trust in God
The disbelievers told the Messengers We shall expel you from our land unless you revert to our religion
Their Lord then sent them the messengers a revelation We have decided to destroy the unjust
and settle you in the land thereafter
This is for those who are afraid of Me and of My warning
They prayed for victory and the haughty transgressors were defeated
Thereafter they will face hell fire wherein they will drink boiling water
As they sip the unpleasant water death will approach them from all sides but they will never die
In addition to this they will experience the most intense torment
The deeds of those who deny the existence of their Lord are like ashes blown about by a strong wind on a stormy day
They will achieve nothing from their deeds
What they have done is a manifest error
Do you not realize that God has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
and that it is not at all difficult for God to replace you with another creature if He so wills
On the Day of Judgment everyone will appear before God and those who have been suppressed will say to their oppressors We were your followers can you do anything to rescue us from the torment of God
They will reply Had God guided us we would also have guided you
It makes no difference whether we cry for help or exercise patience there is no escape for us
When the decree of God is issued satan will say God s promise to you was true but I too made a promise to you and disregarded it
I had no authority over you
I just called you and you answered
Do not blame me but blame yourselves
I cannot help you and you cannot help me
I did not agree with your belief that I was equal to God
The unjust will face a painful punishment
The righteously striving believers will be admitted to the gardens wherein streams flow and they will live therein forever by the permission of their Lord
Their greeting to each other will be Peace be with you
Consider Muhammad how God in a parable compares the blessed Word to that of a blessed tree which has firm roots and branches rising up into the sky
and yields fruits in every season by the permission of its Lord
God sets forth parables for people so that they may take heed
An evil word is compared to an evil tree with no firm roots in the land and thus has no stability
God strengthens the faith of the believers by the true Words in this world and in the life to come
He causes the unjust to go astray and does whatever He pleases
Have you not seen those who changed the Word of God through disbelief and led their people to destruction
They will suffer in Hell
What a terrible place to stay
To lead people astray they claimed their idols were equal to God
Muhammad tell them Enjoy yourselves and know that the only place for you to go will be hell fire
Tell My believing servants to be steadfast in prayer and to spend for the cause of their Lord both in private and in public out of what We have given them Let them do this before the coming of the day when there will be no merchandising or friendship
God is the One who created the heavens and the earth sent down water from the sky by which He produced fruits for your sustenance enabled you to use boats to sail on the sea and placed the rivers at your disposal all by His command
He made the sun and moon each following its course and the day and the night all subservient to you
He has given you everything that you asked Him for
Had you wanted to count the bounties of God you would not have been able to do it
The human being is unjust and disbelieving
Muhammad consider when Abraham prayed Lord make this Mecca a peaceful territory and save me and my offspring from worshipping idols
Lord the idols have misled many people
Whoever follows me is my friend
As for those who disobey You are certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Lord I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley near your Sacred House so that they could be steadfast in prayer Lord fill the hearts of the people with love for them and produce fruits for their sustenance so that they may give thanks
Lord You know all that we conceal or reveal
Nothing in the heavens or the earth is hidden from God
It is only God who deserves all praise I praise Him for His giving me my sons Ishmael and Isaac during my old age
My Lord certainly hears all prayers
Lord make me and my offspring steadfast in prayer and accept our worship
Lord on the Day of Judgment forgive me and my parents and all the believers
Muhammad do not think that God is unaware of what the unjust people do
He only gives them a respite until the day when the eyes will stare fixedly
when people will hurry in fright their heads raised their eyes unable to look around and their hearts stunned due to the confusion which will prevail on that Day
Muhammad warn the people of the day when torment will approach them and the unjust will say Lord give us respite for a little time so that we may answer your call and follow the Messengers The answer to their prayer will be Did you not swear before that you would never perish
You lived in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves even though it was made clear to you how We dealt with them
We also showed you examples
They devised evil plans which were so sinful that even the mountains could not endure them
All these were known to God
You must not even think that God will disregard His promise to His messengers
God is Majestic and Revengeful
On the day when the earth and the heavens will be replaced by another earth and heavens and everyone will be brought before the One Almighty God
you will see the guilty ones bound in chains
with garments of pitch and faces covered by fire
This is how God will recompense each soul for its deeds
God s reckoning is swift
This is an admonition for the people that they will be warned and know that He is the only God and so that the people of understanding may take heed
Alif Lam
Ra These are the verses of the Book and the glorious Quran
How strongly the unbelievers will wish that they had been Muslims
Muhammad leave them alone to eat and enjoy themselves and let their desires deceive them they will soon know the Truth
We never destroyed any town without preordaining the fate of its people
Every nation can only live for the time appointed for it
The unbelievers have said You to whom the Quran has been revealed are insane
Why do you not bring down the angels if what you say is true
We do not send down angels except for a genuine purpose at which time none will be given any further respite
We Ourselves have revealed the Quran and We are its Protectors
We sent Messengers to the ancient people who lived before you
No Messenger went to them whom they did not mock
This is how We cause the hearts of the guilty ones to behave
They do not believe in the Truth and they exactly follow the tradition of the ancient unbelievers
Had We opened a door for them in the sky through which they could easily pass
they would have said Our eyes are bewildered and we have been affected by magic
We have made constellations in the sky and decorated them for the onlookers
We have protected them from every condemned devil
except for those who stealthily try to listen to the heavens but who are chased away by a bright flame
We have spread out the earth fixed mountains thereupon and caused everything to grow to its proper weight
to provide you and those for whose sustenance you are not responsible with the necessities of life
With Us is the source of everything and We do not send it down except in a known quantity
We send impregnating winds and send down water from the sky for you to drink and you have no control over its storage
It is We who give life and cause things to die and We are the sole Heirs
We know the people who lived before you and those who will come into existence after you
Your Lord will resurrect them all He is Allwise and Allknowing
We have created the human being out of pure mudmoulded clay
and the jinn before the human being of smokeless fire
When your Lord said to the angels I will create the human being out of pure mudmoulded clay
When it is properly shaped and I have blown My Spirit into it you should then bow down in prostration
All the angels prostrated before Adam
except Iblis who refused to join with the others in prostration
God asked Iblis What made you not join the others in prostration
Iblis replied I did not want to prostrate before a human being whom You have created out of mudmoulded clay
God told him Get out of the garden you are rejected
and will be subjected to condemnation until the Day of Judgment
Iblis prayed Lord grant me respite until the Day of Judgment
The Lord said Your request is granted
for an appointed time
Iblis said Lord because you have caused me to go astray I shall make earthly things attractive to people and mislead all of them
except Your sincere servants
God said The path which leads to Me is a straight
and you have no authority over My servants except the erring ones who follow you
Hell is the promised place for them all
It has seven gates and each gate is assigned for a certain group of people
The pious will live in gardens with streams
and they will be told to enter there in peace and safety
We shall remove all hatred from their breasts and make them as brothers reclining on thrones facing one another
No fatigue will touch them nor will they be expelled therefrom
Muhammad tell My servants that I am Allforgiving and Allmerciful
and that My punishment is a painful one
Tell them about the guests of Abraham
who came to him saying Peace be with you
Abraham said We are afraid of you
They replied Do not be afraid We have brought you the glad news of the birth of a learned son
Abraham asked Are you giving me the glad news of a son in my old age
What reason can you give for such glad news
They said We have given you the glad news for a true reason so do not despair
He said No one despairs of the mercy of his Lord except those who are in error
Messengers what is your task
They said We are sent to a sinful people
Only the family of Lot will all be saved
except his wife who is doomed to be left behind
When the Messengers came to the family of Lot
he said You seem to be strangers
They replied We have come to you about the matter which the unbelievers have rejected
We have come to you for a genuine purpose and We are true in what we say
Leave the town with your family sometime during the night
Walk behind them and let no one turn around
Proceed as you are commanded
We informed him that the unbelievers would be utterly destroyed
The people of the town rejoicingly
rushed towards the house of Lot
Lot said to them These are my guests
Do not disgrace me
Have fear of God and do not humiliate me
They replied Did we not forbid you to bring anyone to your house
Lot said These are my daughters if you want them
By your life
In their drunkenness they were truly blind
An explosion struck them at sunrise
We turned the town upsidedown and showered on them lumps of baked clay
In this there is evidence of the Truth for the prudent ones
That town lies on a road which still exists
In this there is evidence of the Truth for the believers
Since the People of the Forest were unjust
We afflicted them with punishment
Both people had clear divine authority among them
People of Hijr rejected the Messengers
We showed them miracles but they ignored them
They would carve secure houses out of the mountains
An explosion struck them in the morning
Out of what they had gained nothing proved to be of any benefit to them
We have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for a genuine purpose
The Day of Judgment will certainly approach so Muhammad forgive them graciously
Your Lord is certainly the Allknowing Creator
Muhammad We have given you the seven most repeated verses and the great Quran
Do not yearn for other people s property and wives and do not grieve that they do not believe Be kind to the believers
Say Indeed I am simply one who warns
We have given you the Quran as We had given the Bible to those who divided themselves into groups
and also divided the Quran believing in some parts and rejecting others
By the Lord We will hold them all responsible
for what they have done
Preach what you have been commanded to and stay away from the pagans
We shall help you against those who mock you
and believe other things to be equal to God
They will soon know the truth
We certainly know that you feel sad about what they say against you
Glorify and praise your Lord and be with those who prostrate themselves before God
Worship your Lord until you achieve the ultimate certainty
God s help will certainly support the believers so pagans do not seek to hasten it God is too Glorious and Exalted to be considered equal to idols
He sends the angels with the Spirit to carry His orders to whichever of His servants He wants so that they would warn people that He is the only God and that people must have fear of Him
He has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose He is too Exalted to be considered equal to anything else
He created the human being from a drop of fluid but the human being openly disputes His Word
He created cattle which provide you with clothes food and other benefits
How beautiful you find them when you bring them home and when you drive them out to graze
They carry your heavy loads to lands which you would not have been able to reach without great difficulty
Your Lord is certainly Compassionate and AllMerciful
He created horses mules and donkeys for you to ride and as a means of beauty
He has also created things that you do not know
Some paths lead away from God but one must follow the path that leads to God
Had God wanted He could have guided all to the right path
It is God who sends down water from the sky for you to drink and produces plants as pasture for your cattle
With this water He causes corn olives palmtrees vines and all kinds of fruits to grow
In this there is evidence of the existence of God for the people of understanding
God has made the day and the night the sun and the moon and all the stars subservient to you by His command
In this there is evidence of the truth for people of understanding
All that He has created for you on the earth are of different colors
In this there is evidence of the Truth for the people who take heed
It is God who put the oceans at your disposal so that you could find therein fresh fish for food and ornaments with which to deck yourselves with You will find ships that sail for you so that you may travel in search of the bounties of God and give Him thanks
God has fixed the mountains on earth lest you should be hurled away when it quakes Therein He has also made rivers and roads so that you will find your way
The stars and other signs also help people to find their way
Is the One who can create equal to the one who cannot create anything
Why then will you not consider
Even if you wanted to count up all of God s blessings you would not be able to
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God knows all that you conceal or reveal
Whatever idols they worship besides God can create nothing for they are themselves created
They are not living but are dead
They can not know when they will be raised
Your Lord is only One
The hearts of those who do not believe in the life hereafter dislike the truth
They are puffed up with pride
God certainly knows whatever you conceal or reveal
He does not love the proud ones
When they are asked What has your Lord revealed to you they say Only ancient legends
Besides their own burdens on the Day of Judgment they will have to carry on the burdens of those whom they have misled without knowledge
How evil that burden will be
Those who went before them had also devised evil plans
God demolished their houses destroying their very foundations Their ceilings toppled on their heads and torment struck them from a direction which they had never expected
God will humiliate them on the Day of Judgment and ask them Where are the idols which you had considered equal to Me and which were the cause of hostility and animosity among you
The people who were given knowledge will say It is the unbelievers who face disgrace and trouble on this day
The unjust who will be seized by the angels will submit themselves obey and say We were not evildoers But God certainly knows what they had been doing
They will be commanded to enter hell to live therein forever
How terrible will be the place of the proud ones
The pious ones will be asked What did your Lord reveal to you They will reply He revealed only good
The share of the righteous ones is virtue in this world and greater virtue in the life to come
How blessed will be the dwelling of the pious ones
They will be admitted into the gardens of Eden wherein steams flow and they will have therein whatever they want
This is how God will reward the pious ones
They will be received by the angels of mercy with the greeting Peace be with you
Enter Paradise as a reward for your good deeds
Are they the disbelievers waiting for the angels and the decree of your Lord to be fulfilled before they believe
The people who lived before them had also done the same thing
God did not do injustice to them but they wronged themselves
The evil consequences of their deeds afflicted them and they were surrounded by what they had mocked
The pagans had said Had God wanted we would not have worshipped anything other than Him nor would our fathers
We would not have forbidden anything without a command from Him
The same thing was said by the people who lived before them Are the Messengers expected to do more than just preach
To every nation We sent a Messenger who told its people Worship God and stay away from satan
Some of them were guided by God and others were doomed to go astray
Travel through the land and see how terrible was the end for those who rejected the truth
Muhammad even though you have a strong desire to guide them be sure that God will not guide those who have gone astray and no one will be able to help them
They strongly swear by God that God will not bring the dead to life
God s promise of the Resurrection will certainly come true but many people do not know
Through the resurrection God wants to make a clear distinction between right and wrong and make the unbelievers know that they were liars
When We want to bring something into existence Our command is Exist and it comes into existence
God settles those who leave their homes for His cause after having suffered injustice in a prosperous dwelling in this life and greater rewards will be theirs in the life to come
Would that they knew this
It is they who have exercised patience and trust in their Lord
The Messengers whom We sent before you were mere mortals to whom We had sent with miracles and revelations Ask those who know about the heavenly Books if you do not know about this
We have revealed the Quran to you so that you could tell the people what has been revealed to them and so that perhaps they will think
Can they who have devised evil plans expect to be safe from the command of God to the earth to swallow them up or from a torment which might strike them from an unexpected direction
Are they confident that God will not seize them while they are on a journey
They will not be able to escape from God
Are they confident that God will not slowly destroy them
Your Lord is Compassionate and Allmerciful
Can they not see that the shadows of whatever God has created turn to the right and to the left in prostration and submission to Him
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth the cattle and the angels prostrate themselves before God without pride
They angels have fear of their Lord above them and fulfill His commands
God says Do not worship two gods
There is only One God
Have fear of Me
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God s retribution is severe
Should you then have fear of anyone other than God
Whatever bounties you have are from God
When hardship befalls you you begin to cry out to Him
When He saves you from the hardship some of you start to believe in idols
In the end you will reject Our bounties
Enjoy yourselves you will soon know the consequences of your deeds
They give to unknown images a share out of the sustenance that We gave them
By God you will be questioned about that which you have falsely invented
They ascribe daughters to God God is too Exalted to have daughters but they can have whatever they want
When the glad news of the birth of their daughter is brought to them their faces turn gloomy and black with anger
They try to hide themselves from the people because of the disgrace of such news
Will they keep their new born despite the disgrace or bury it alive
How sinful is their Judgment
Those who do not believe in the life to come are evil examples To God belongs all the exalted attributes He is the Majestic and the Allwise
Was God to seize people immediately for their injustice no living creature would be left on earth
He gives them respite for an appointed time
When their term is over they will not be able to change the inevitable
They ascribe to God that which even they themselves do not like and their lying tongues say that their end will be virtuous Their share will certainly be hell fire to which they are earnestly heading
By God We sent Messengers to nations who lived before you
Satan made their deeds seem attractive to them and on the Day of Judgment satan will be their guardian
For them there will be a painful punishment
We have sent you the Book for no other reason than to settle their differences and to be a guide and mercy for those who believe
God has sent down water from the sky and has brought the dead earth to life
In this there is evidence of the truth for those who listen carefully
There is a lesson for you to learn concerning cattle We provide pleasant milk for you to drink within the delicate system of their veins and arteries
The fruit of palm trees and vines which provide you with sugar and delicious food also provide a lesson and evidence of the Truth for the people of understanding
Your Lord inspired the bees Make hives in the mountains in the trees and in the trellises
then eat of every fruit and follow the path of your Lord submissively
From out of their bellies comes a drink of different color in which there is a cure for the human being
In this there is evidence of the truth for the people of understanding
God has created you and He causes you to die
Some of you will grow to an extremely old age and lose your memory
God is Allknowing and Almighty
God has made some of you richer than others
The rich ones do not have to give away their property to their slaves to make them equally rich
Do they reject the bounties of God
God has created spouses for you from your own selves He has created your sons and grandsons from your spouses and has given you pure things for your sustenance
Do they then believe in falsehood and reject the bounties of God
Do they worship things other than God which neither provide them with any sustenance from the heavens and the earth nor have the ability to do so
Do not consider anything equal to God
God knows that which you do not know
God tells a parable about a helpless servant and one to whom He has given honorable provisions and who has spent for the cause of God privately and in public Can these two people be considered equal
It is only God who deserves all praise but most people do not know
God tells a parable about two men One of them is dumb and useless and a burden on his friend
Wherever he goes he returns with nothing
Can he be considered equal to the one who maintains justice and follows the right path
To God belongs all the secrets of the heavens and the earth
It only takes God a twinkling of an eye or even less to make it the Day of Judgment
God has power over all things
When God brought you out of your mothers wombs you knew nothing
He gave you ears eyes and hearts so that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Have you not considered the free movements of the birds high in the sky above
What keeps them aloft except God
In this there is evidence of the truth for the believing people
He has also made homes for you out of the skins of cattle which are easy to carry along on a journey or at a camp He has made wool fur and the hair of cattle a temporary means of enjoyment for you
God has provided shade for you out of what He has created and places of retreat out of mountains He has given you garments to protect you from the heat and cover your private parts
This is how He perfects His bounties to you so that perhaps you would submit to His will
Muhammad if they turn away your only duty is to clearly preach to them
They recognize the bounties of God but they refuse them and most of them are unbelievers
On the day when We will call a witness from every nation the disbelievers will not be given permission for anything nor will they be allowed to seek solicitation
There will be no relief for them when the torment approaches the unjust nor will they be given any respite
When the idolators see their idols they will say Lord these are the idols whom we worshipped instead of you
But the idols will say They are liars
On the Day of Judgment the disbelievers will submit themselves to God and whatever they had falsely invented will disappear
The disbelievers who had created obstacles in the way leading to God will face manifold torments as a result of their evil deeds
On the day when We call a witness against every nation from their own people We will call you Muhammad as a witness against them all
We have sent you the Book which clarifies all matters It is a guide a mercy and glad news to the Muslims
God commands people to maintain justice kindness and proper relations with their relatives He forbids them to commit indecency sin and rebellion
God gives you advice so that perhaps you will take heed
He commands people to keep their established covenants with God not to disregard their firm oaths they have already appointed God as their Guarantor
God certainly knows what you do
Do not be like the lady behind the spinning wheel who has broken the yarn by pulling it with unnecessary force
You must not consider your oaths as means of deceit to benefit one party and incur loss upon the other
God tests your faith by your oaths
He will make clear to you who was right and who was wrong on the Day of Judgment
Had God wanted He would have made you one single nation but He guides or causes to go astray whomever He wants
You will certainly be questioned about what you have done
Do not consider your oaths as a means of deceit lest you damage the firmness of your faith suffer from evil by creating obstacles in the way that leads to God and incur a great torment upon yourselves
Do not sell your covenant with God for a small price
The reward which you will receive from God is better for you if only you knew it
Whatever you possess is transient and whatever is with God is everlasting
We will recompense those who exercise patience with their due reward and even more
All righteously believing male or female will be granted a blessed happy life and will receive their due reward and more
Muhammad when you recite the Quran seek refuge in God from the mischief of satan
Satan has certainly no authority over the believers who have trust in their Lord
The only authority which he has is over his friends and those who consider things equal to God
When God replaces one revelation with another He knows best what to reveal But they say Muhammad you have falsely invented it
Most people are ignorant
Muhammad say The Holy Spirit has brought the Quran from your Lord to you in all truth to strengthen the faith of the believers and to be a guide and glad news for the Muslims
We know that they say a mere mortal has taught it the Quran to him Muhammad
The language of the person whom they think has taught it to him is not Arabic
This the Quran is in illustrious Arabic
God will not guide those who do not believe in His miracles
They will suffer a painful punishment
Those who do not believe in the miracles of God invent lies and they are liars
No one verbally denounces his faith in God unless he is forced but his heart is confident about his faith
But those whose breasts have become open to disbelief will be subject to the wrath of God and will suffer a great torment
This is because they have given preference to this life over the life to come and God does not guide disbelieving people
God has sealed their hearts ears and eyes and they are not aware of it
On the Day of Judgment they will certainly be lost
Those who left their homes for the cause of God after they had been persecuted strove hard for His cause and exercised patience should know even though they had verbally renounced their faith that your Lord is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
On the Day of Judgment every soul shall try to defend itself and every soul will be justly recompensed
God tells a parable about a secure and peaceful town surrounded by abundant sustenance
Its inhabitants rejected the bounties of God and He caused them to suffer hunger and fear as a result of their deeds
A Messenger from their own people came to them and they called him a liar Torment struck them because of their injustice
People consume the pure and lawful sustenance which God has given to you and thank God for his bounty if you are His true worshippers
The only things which are made unlawful for you are the flesh of dead animals blood pork and that which is not consecrated with the Name of God
But in an emergency without the intention of transgression and rebellion it is not an offense for one to consume such things
God is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Unbelievers do not follow whatever your lying tongues may tell you is lawful or unlawful to invent lies against God
Those who invent lies against God will have no happiness
Such an invention will bring only a little enjoyment but will be followed by painful torment
We had made unlawful for the Jews all that we told you before
We did not do any wrong to them but they wronged themselves
To those who commit sins in their ignorance then repent and reform your Lord is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Abraham was certainly an obedient and upright person
He was not a pagan
He was thankful to God for His bounties
God chose him and guided him to the right path
We granted him virtue in this life and he shall be among the righteous ones in the life to come
We sent you Muhammad a revelation that you should follow the tradition of Abraham the upright one who was not a pagan
The observance of the Sabbath was only sanctioned for those who disputed it
Your Lord will certainly issue His decree about their dispute on the Day of Judgment
Call the pagans to the path of your Lord through wisdom and good advice and argue with them in the best manner
God knows well about those who stray from His path and those who seek guidance
If you want retaliation let it be equal to that which you faced But if you exercise patience it will be better for you
Exercise patience and let it be only for the cause of God
Do not be grieved about them nor disappointed at their evil plans
God is certainly with the pious and the righteous ones
God is the Exalted One who took His servant one night for a visit from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem God has blessed the surroundings of the Aqsa Mosque
He took His servant on this visit to show him miraculous evidence of His existence It is He who is Allhearing and Allaware
To Moses We gave the Book and made it a guide for the children of Israel so that they would not have any one as their guardian other than Me
We made it a guide for the offspring of those whom We carried in the Ark with Noah a thankful servant of God
We made it known to the Israelites through the Torah that they would twice commit evil in the land with great transgression and rebellion
We told them during your first uprising of evil We shall send to you
This is a decree already ordained We then gave you a chance to defeat your enemies with the help of increasing your wealth and offspring
We told you If you do good it will be for your own benefit but if you do bad it will be against your souls When the prophecy of your second transgression will come to pass sadness will cover your faces
They your enemies will enter the mosque as they did the first time to bring about utter destruction
Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you
If you return to disobedience We will also punish you again
We have made hell a prison for the disbelievers
This Quran shows the way to that which is the most upright and gives to the righteous believers the glad news of a great reward
It also declares that for the disbelievers We have prepared a painful torment in the life to come
People pray as earnestly to gain evil as one should to gain virtue But people are hasty
We have made the day and night each as evidence of Our existence
The night is invisible and the day is visible so that you may seek favors from your Lord and determine the number of years and mark the passing of time
For everything We have given a detailed explanation
We have made every person s actions cling to his neck On the Day of Judgment We will bring forth the record of his actions in the form of a wide open book
We will tell him Read it and judge for yourself
One who follows guidance does so for himself and one who goes astray does so against his soul
No one will suffer for the sins of others
We have never punished anyone without sending them Our Messenger first
When We decide to destroy a town We warn the rich ones therein who commit evil
Thus it becomes deserving to destruction and We destroy its very foundations
We have destroyed many generations after the time of Noah
Your Lord is All knowing and Well Aware of the sins of His servants
Whoever desires only the enjoyment of this life will receive it if We want it to be so
Then We will make Hell his reward wherein he will suffer despised and driven away from Our mercy
The effort of one who faithfully strives hard for the happiness of the life to come will be appreciated by God
Each group will receive its share of your Lord s generosity
Your Lord s generosity is not limited
Consider how We have given preference to some people above others yet the life to come has more honor and respect
Do not consider anything equal to God lest you will become despised and neglected
Your Lord has ordained that you must not worship anything other than Him and that you must be kind to your parents
If either or both of your parents should become advanced in age do not express to them words which show your slightest disappointment Never yell at them but always speak to them with kindness
Be humble and merciful towards them and say Lord have mercy upon them as they cherished me in my childhood
Your Lord knows what is in your souls
If you would be righteous know that He is Allforgiving to those who turn to Him in repentance
Give the relatives the destitute and those who when on a journey have become needy their dues
Do not be a wasteful spender Squanderers are the brothers of satan
Satan was faithless to his Lord
If you are not able to assist them at least speak to them in a kind manner
Do not be stingy nor over generous lest you become empty handed and bankrupt
Your Lord increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants
He is Well Aware and watches over His servants
Do not kill your children for fear of poverty
We will give sustenance to all of you
To kill them is certainly a great sin
Do not even approach adultery
It is indecent and an evil act
Do not kill a respectable soul without a just cause
If anyone is wrongfully killed we have given the heirs of that person the right to demand satisfaction or to forgive
He must not exceed the law in having vengeance his victim shall also be assisted by law
Do not get close to the property of the orphans unless it is for a good reason until they are mature and strong Keep your promise you will be questioned about it
While weighing use proper measurements in the exchange of your property
This is fair and will be better in the end
Do not follow what you do not know the ears eyes and hearts will all be held responsible for their deeds
Do not walk proudly on the earth your feet cannot tear apart the earth nor are you as tall as the mountains
All such things are sins and detestable in the sight of your Lord
Muhammad these are words of wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you
Do not consider anything equal to God lest you be thrown into hell despised and driven away from God s mercy
Pagans has your Lord given you preference over Himself by granting you sons and taking the angels as His own daughters
What you say is a monstrous utterance
We have given you various facts about the Truth in this Quran so that they unbelievers would take heed but this has only increased their aversion to the truth
Muhammad ask them Had there been many other gods besides Him as they say they should have found a way to the Lord of the Throne
God is too Glorious and Exalted to be considered as they believe Him to be He is the most High and Great
The seven heavens the earth and whatever is between them all glorify Him
There is nothing that does not glorify Him and always praise him but you do not understand their praise and glorification
He is Allforbearing and Allforgiving
When you recite the Quran We place a curtain as a barrier between you and those who do not believe in the life to come
We put a veil over their hearts so that they cannot understand it We deafen their ears
When you mention your Lord in this Quran as One Supreme Being they run away
We know what they want to hear when they listen to you They whisper to each other and say You are only following a bewitched person
Consider what they have called you
They have certainly gone astray and cannot find the right path
The pagans say When we become mere bones and dust shall we then be brought back to life again
Muhammad say Yes even if you become rocks iron
or anything that you think is harder to be brought to life
They will soon ask Who will bring us back to life
Say The One who created you in the first place
They will shake their heads and say When will He bring us back to life
Say Perhaps very soon
On the day when He will call you you will answer Him with praise and think that you have tarried for only a little while
Muhammad tell My servants to say what is best
Satan sows dissension among them he is the sworn enemy of human beings
Your Lord knows better than you people
He will have mercy on you or will punish you as He wills
We have not sent you to watch over them
Your Lord knows best about those in the heavens and the earth
We have given preference to some Prophets over others and We gave the psalms to David
Muhammad tell them Seek help from those whom you consider equal to God
They are not able to remove or change your hardships
Those whom they worship seek to find intercessors for themselves with God They try to find out which of the intercessors are closer to God
They have hope for His mercy and fear of His punishment the punishment of your Lord is awesome
The decree that all the towns were to be destroyed or afflicted with severe punishment was already written in the Book before the Day of Judgment
We did not abstain from sending miracles to any of Our Messengers These miracles were called lies by the people who lived in ancient times
To the people of Thamud We sent the shecamel as a visible miracle and they did injustice to it
We only send miracles as warnings
Muhammad We told you that your Lord has encompassed all mankind
We made the vision which We showed you and the condemned tree mentioned in the Quran as a trial for the human being
Even though We warn them it only increases their rebellion
When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam they all obeyed except Iblis who said Should I prostrate before one whom You have created out of clay
He continued Remember this one whom you have honored more than me I shall bring him and most of his offspring under my sway if you will give me respite until the Day of Judgment
God said Go away
All those who follow you will have hell as ample recompense for their deeds
Draw anyone of them you can into sin by your voice and by your cavalry and infantry share their property and children with them and make promises to them
Your promises are all lies
You have no authority over My servants
Your Lord is a Sufficient Protector
Your Lord who causes the ships to sail on the sea so that you may seek His bounty is certainly Allmerciful to you
If you are afflicted by hardships in the middle of the sea it would be an error to call anyone other than Him for help
When God saves you from such difficulties you turn away from Him
The human being has always been ungrateful
Do you feel secure that We will not cause a part of the land to sink or engulf you with sand storms when you would find no one to protect you
Do you feel secure that We will not drive you back to the sea send a fierce gale to you and cause you to drown because of your disbelief when you would not be able to find anyone who would intercede for you with Us
We have honored the children of Adam carried them on the land and the sea given them pure sustenance and exalted them above most of My creatures
On the day when We call every nation with their leaders those whose record of deeds are given to their right hands will read the book and the least wrong will not be done to them
Those who are blind in this life will also be blind in the life to come and in terrible error
Such blind ones try to confuse what We have revealed to you so that they may falsely ascribe to Us something other than the true revelation and thus establish friendship with you
Had We not strengthened your faith you might have relied on them some how
Had you done so We would certainly have made you face double punishment in this life and after your death and you would have found none to help you
They try to annoy you so that they can expel you from the land
Had they been successful no one would have been left behind except a few
This was Our tradition with Our Messengers who lived before you and you will find no change in Our tradition
Say your prayer when the sun declines until the darkness of night and also at dawn
Dawn is certainly witnessed by the angels of the night and day
Say your special tahajjud prayer during some part of the night as an additional obligatory prayer for you alone so that perhaps your Lord will raise you to a highly praiseworthy position
Muhammad say Lord make me enter through a path that will lead to the Truth and come out of an exit that will take me to the Truth
Give me helpful authority
Say Truth has come and falsehood has been banished it is doomed to banishment
We reveal the Quran which is a cure and mercy for the believers but does nothing for the unjust except to lead them to perdition
When We do favors to the human being he disregards it and turns away from it
When evil afflicts him he becomes despairing
Say Everyone does as he wants
Your Lord knows best who has the right guidance
They ask you about the Spirit
Say The Spirit comes by the command of my Lord
You have been given very little knowledge
Had We wanted We could have removed the Spirit through whom We sent you revelation
Then you would not have found anyone to intercede with Us for you
except by the mercy of your Lord
He has certainly bestowed great favors on you
Say If all human beings and jinn were to come together to bring the equivalent of this Quran they could not do so even if they all were to help each other
We have mentioned in this Quran all kinds of examples for the human being but most human beings turn away in disbelief
They have said We shall never believe you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth
or you show us that you have your own garden of palm trees and vines with flowing streams therein
or cause the sky to fall into pieces on us as you believe you can or bring God and the angels face to face with us
or show us that you have a well adorned house of your own or climb into the sky
We shall never believe that you have climbed into the sky until you bring us a book that we can read
Say All glory belongs to my Lord
Am I more than a mortal Messenger
What keeps people from belief that guidance has come to them but they question Why has God sent a mortal Messenger
Muhammad say Had the earth been inhabited by angels who would walk serenely therein only then would We have sent to them angelic Messengers
Say God is a sufficient Witness between me and you
He certainly sees and knows all about His servants
Whomever God has guided has the proper guidance
You will never find any guardian besides God for the one whom He has caused to go astray
On the Day of Judgment We will gather them lying on their faces blind dumb and deaf
Hell will be their dwelling
As hell fire abates We will increase its blazing force
This will be the recompense for their disbelief of Our revelations and for their saying Shall we be brought to life again after becoming bones and dust
Do they not realize that God who has created the heavens and the earth has the power to create their like
He has given them life for an appointed time of which there is no doubt
The unjust turn away in disbelief from Our revelation
Say Had you owned the treasures of the Mercy of my Lord you would have locked them up for fear of spending them
The human being has always been stingy
To Moses We gave nine illustrious miracles Ask the Israelites Moses came to them
The Pharaoh said to him Moses I believe that you are bewitched
He replied Certainly you have come to know that these have been sent by the Lord of the heavens and the earth as lessons to people
Pharaoh I believe that you are doomed to perdition
The Pharaoh wanted to expel the Israelites from the land so We drowned him and all who were with him
We told the Israelites after this to settle in the land until Our second promise will come true We would then gather them all together on the Day of Judgment
We sent it the Quran in all Truth and in all Truth it came
Muhammad We have sent you for no other reason than to be a bearer of glad news and a warner
We have divided the Quran into many segments so that you would read them to the people in gradual steps as We reveal them to you from time to time
Say It does not matter whether you believe in it or not for when it is read to those who had received the knowledge heavenly Books that were sent before they bow down and prostrate themselves before the Lord
They say Our Lord is too Glorious to disregard His promise
They bow down in prostration and weep and it makes them more humble before the Lord
Muhammad tell them It is all the same whether you call Him God or the Beneficent
All the good names belong to Him
Muhammad do not be too loud or slow in your prayer
Choose a moderate way of praying
Say It is only God who deserves all praise He has not begotten a son and has no partner in His Kingdom
He does not need any guardian to help Him in His need Proclaim His greatness
Praise be to God He has sent the Book to His servant and has made it a flawless guide for human beings
so that he could warn them of His stern retribution give the glad news of the best and everlasting reward to the righteously striving believers
wherein they shall remain forever
and admonish those who say that God has begotten a son
Neither they nor their fathers had any knowledge of such utterance that God has begotten a son
Whatever they say about this matter is vicious blasphemy and plain lies
Perhaps you will destroy yourself out of grief because they disbelieve this Book
We have caused earthly things to seem attractive so that We can see who will excel in good deeds
Let it be known that We will turn all things on earth into dust
Do you not think that the story of the Companions of the Cave and the Inscription was one of Our marvelous miracles
When the youth sought refuge in the cave they prayed Lord grant us mercy and help us to get out of this trouble in a righteous way
We sealed their ears in the cave for a number of years
Then We roused them to find out which of the party had the correct account of the duration of their sleep in the cave
We tell you this story for a genuine purpose
They were young people who believed in their Lord and We gave them further guidance
We strengthened their hearts when they stood up against the idols and said Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth
We shall never worship anyone other than Him lest we commit blasphemy
Our people have considered other things equal to God
Why cannot they present clear proof in support of their claim
Who is more unjust than one who invents falsehood against God
They were told Now that you have abandoned them and what they worship instead of God seek refuge in the cave God will certainly grant you mercy and provide you with help to safely get out of this trouble
No sunlight could reach them during their sleep in the cave One could see the rising sun decline to the right of their cave and the setting sun move its way to the left whilst they were sleeping in an opening of the cave
This is one of the miracles of God
Whomever God guides receives the right guidance and you will never find a guardian or guide for those whom He causes to go astray
One would think them the youths awake while in fact they were sleeping
We turned their bodies from right to left and their dog stretched its front legs on the ground
Had one looked them over he would have run away from them in terror
We roused them from their sleep so that they would question each other about their stay in the cave
One of them said How long do you think we have stayed here
They replied A day or part of a day
They added Your Lord knows better how long we have stayed here
Let us send one of us with this money to the city to get some pure food so that we might eat
He should be careful so that no one will know about us If they were to recognize us
they would certainly stone us to death or force us to follow their religion
Then we shall never be able to have everlasting happiness
We caused their story to become public so that people would know that God s promise was true and that there is no doubt about the coming of the Day of Judgment
They started to argue with each other about the matter Resurrection and some of them said Let us establish a building at the youths sleeping place to hide them
Their Lord knew best their intentions about them
The majority prevailed in their suggestion of the establishment of a mosque in that place
With regard to the number of the youths some say There were three and the dog was the fourth one Others say There were five and the dog was the sixth one
In reality they are just feeling around in the dark
Still some of them say There were seven and the dog was the eighth one
Muhammad say My Lord has the best knowledge of their number
You know very little about it
Do not insist on arguing with them but merely tell them the story as it has been revealed to you and do not ask anyone about them
Never say of something I shall do it tomorrow
without adding if God wills
Recall your Lord if you forget to do something Say I hope that my Lord will provide me better guidance
They in fact stayed in the cave for three hundred plus nine further years
Muhammad say God knows best how long they stayed there to Him belongs the unseen of both the heavens and the earth How clear is His sight and how keen His hearing No one other than Him is their guardian and no one shares His Judgment
Read whatever is revealed to you from the Book of your Lord
No one can change His words and you can never find any refuge other than Him
Be patient with those who worship their Lord in the mornings and evenings to seek His pleasure
Do not overlook them to seek the worldly pleasures
Do not obey those whom We have caused to neglect Us and instead follow their own desires beyond all limits
Say Truth comes from your Lord
Let people have faith or disbelieve as they chose
For the unjust We have prepared a fire which will engulf them with its flames
Whenever they cry for help they will be answered with water as hot as molted brass which will scald their faces
How terrible is such a drink and such a resting place
The righteously striving believers should know that We do not neglect the reward of those who do good deeds
They will be admitted to the gardens of Eden wherein streams flow
They will rest on soft couches decked with bracelets of gold and clothed in green silk garments and shining brocade
How blissful is such a reward and resting place
Muhammad tell them the parable of the two men
To one of them We had given two gardens of vines surrounded by the palm trees with a piece of farm land between them
and a stream flowing through the middle of the gardens
Both gardens would yield fruits to their fullest capacity
Whatever was produced belonged to him To his friend he exclaimed I have more wealth and greater manpower than you
He unjustly entered his garden and said I do not think this property will ever perish
nor do I think that there will be a Day of Judgment
Even if I shall be brought before my Lord I certainly deserve to have a better place than this
His friend said to him How can you disbelieve in the One who turned clay into sperm out of which He created you
I believe that He is God my Lord and I do not consider anything equal to Him
When entering your garden you should have said This is what God willed All Power belongs to Him
Even if you consider me inferior to yourself in wealth and offspring
perhaps my Lord will give me a garden better than yours and strike your garden with a thunderbolt from the sky to turn it into a barren ground
or cause the streams in your garden to disappear under the ground such that you will never be able to find them
Sure enough the rich person s fruits were all destroyed and he began to wring his hands in grief for all that he had invested in his garden
He found his garden tumbled to its trellises and said Would that I had not considered anything equal to my Lord
He had no one besides God to help him nor could he himself achieve any success
In such helplessness the human being realizes that it is God who is the true Guardian and His rewards and recompense are the best
Muhammad tell them The worldly life resembles the seasonal plants that blossom by the help of the water which God sends from the sky
After a short time all of them fade away and the winds scatter them and turns them into dust
God has power over all things
Children and property are the ornaments of the worldly life but for deeds which continually produce virtue one can obtain better rewards from God and have greater hope in Him
On the day when We will cause the mountains to travel around and the earth to turn into a levelled plain We will also bring all human beings together No one will be left behind
They will all be lined up in the presence of your Lord who will tell them Despite your belief that there would never be a Day of Judgment all of you are brought in Our presence just as though We had created you for the first time
You believed that our promise could never come true
When the record of every one s deeds is placed before him you will see the criminals terrified from what the record contains
They will say Woe to us
What kind of record is this that has missed nothing small or great
They will find whatever they have done right before their very eyes
Your Lord is not unjust to any one
When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam they all obeyed except Iblis
He was a jinn and he sinned against the command of his Lord
Why do you people obey him and his offspring instead of Me even though they are your enemies
How terrible will be the recompense that the wrong doers will receive
I did not call the unjust to witness the creation of the heavens and earth nor to witness their own creation nor did I want to be helped by those who lead people astray
On the day when God asks the idolators to seek help from their idols they will call their idols for help
But the idols will not answer them We shall separate the two parties from each other by a destructive gulf
When the criminals see hell fire they will have no doubt about falling headlong therein nor of finding anyone to save them
We have given various examples in this Quran for people to learn a lesson but the human being is the most contentious creature
What prevents people from having faith when guidance comes to them or from asking for forgiveness from their Lord before they face the kind of torment that the ancient people experienced or a new form of torment
The only reason for Our sending the Messengers is to give the human being the glad news of Our mercy and to warn him about Our wrath
The disbelievers argue by false means to refute the Truth
They mock My miracles and warnings
Who are more unjust than those who are reminded of the revelations of their Lord but have disregarded them and have forgotten their deeds
We have veiled their hearts and sealed their ears so that they cannot understand
Even if you call them to the right path they will never accept guidance
Your Lord is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Had He wanted to punish them for their sins He would have been prompt to torment them
For their punishment there is an appointed time after which there will be no way for them to escape
We only destroyed the inhabitants of certain towns when they had committed injustice and did not repent before Our deadline
Consider when Moses said to his young companion I shall continue travelling until I reach the junction of the two seas or have travelled for many years
When they reached the junction of the two seas they found out that they had forgotten all about the fish which they had carried for food The fish found its way into the sea
Moses asked his young companion when they crossed this point Bring us our food the journey has made us tired
His companion replied Do you remember the rock on which we took rest
Satan made me forget to mention to you the story of the fish and how it miraculously made its way into the sea
Moses said That is exactly what we are seeking They followed their own foot prints back to the rock
There they met one of Our servants who had received blessings and knowledge from Us
Moses asked him Can I follow you so that you would teach me the guidance that you have received
He replied You will not be able to have patience with me
How can you remain patient with that which you do not fully understand
Moses said If God wishes you will find me patient and I shall not disobey any of your orders
He said to Moses If you will follow me do not ask me about anything until I tell you the story about it
They started their journey and some time latter they embarked in a boat in which he made a hole
Moses asked him Did you make the hole to drown the people on board
This is certainly very strange
He said Did I not tell you that you would not be able to remain patient with me
Moses said Please forgive my forgetfulness Do not oblige me with what is difficult for me to endure
They continued on their journey until they met a young boy whom he killed
Moses said How could you murder an innocent soul
This is certainly a horrible act
He responded Did I not tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me
Moses said If I ask you such questions again abandon me you will have enough reason to do so
They continued on their journey again until they reached a town
They asked the people there for food but no one accepted them as their guests
They found there a wall of a house which was on the verge of tumbling to the ground
The companion of Moses repaired that wall
Moses said You should have received some money for your labor
He replied This is where we should depart from one another
I shall give an explanation to you for all that I have done for which you could not remain patient
The boat belonged to some destitute people who were using it as a means of their living in the sea
The king had imposed a certain amount of tax on every undamaged boat I damaged it so that they would not have to pay the tax
The young boy had very faithful parents
We were afraid that out of love for him they would lose their faith in God and commit rebellion
so We decided that their Lord should replace him by a better and more virtuous son
The tumbling wall belonged to two orphans in the town whose father was a righteous person
Underneath the wall there was a treasure that belonged to them
Your Lord wanted the orphans to find the treasure through the mercy of your Lord when they mature
I did not repair the wall out of my own desire
These were the explanations of my deeds about which you could not remain patient
Muhammad they will ask you about Dhu lQarnayn
Say I shall tell you something about him
We had given him great power in the land and all kinds of resources
With these he traveled
to the West where he found the sun setting into a warm source spring of water and a people living near by
We asked him Dhu lQarnayn you may punish them or treat them with kindness
He replied I shall punish the unjust ones among them and then they will return to their Lord who will punish them more sternly
As for those who believe and do good they will receive virtuous rewards and We will tell them to do only what they can
He travelled again
to the East where he found the sun rising upon a people whom We had exposed to its rays
This indeed was true
We knew all that he did there
He travelled
after this to the middle of two mountains where he found a people who could hardly understand a single word
They said Dhu lQarnayn Gog and Magog are ravaging this land
Would you establish a barrier between us and them if we pay you a certain tax
He replied The power that my Lord has granted me is better than your tax
Help me with your manpower and I shall construct a barrier between you and Gog and Magog
Bring me blocks of iron to fill up the passage between the two mountains
He told them to ply their bellows until the iron became hot as fire
Then he told them to pour on it molten brass
Thus he constructed the barrier which neither Gog nor Magog were able to climb nor were they able to dig a tunnel through the iron and brass barrier
Dhu lQarnayn said This barrier is a blessing from my Lord but when His promise comes to pass He will level it to the ground His promise always comes true
On the day when the barrier is demolished We will leave human beings in chaos
We will leave them like the waves of the sea striking against each other
Then the trumpet will be sounded and We will bring them all together
We will fully expose the view of hell on that Day to the disbelievers
whose eyes had been veiled against Our Quran and who were not able to hear its recitation
Do the unbelievers think they can make My servants as their guardians instead of Me
We have prepared hell as a dwelling place for the disbelievers
Muhammad tell them Should I tell you who will face the greatest loss as a result of their deeds
It will be those who labor a great deal in this life but without guidance yet think that they are doing a great many good deeds
They have rejected the revelations of their Lord and their meeting with Him Thus their deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and will be of no value on the Day of Judgment
For their disbelief and their mocking Our revelations and Messengerss their recompense will be hell
The righteously striving believers will have the gardens of Paradise as their dwelling place and therein they will live forever
without any desire to change their abode
Muhammad tell them Had the seas been used as ink to write down the words of my Lord they would have all been consumed before the words of my Lord could have been recorded even though replenished with a like quantity of ink
Say I am only a mortal like you but I have received revelation that there is only one Lord
Whoever desires to meet his Lord should strive righteously and should worship no one besides Him
Ain Sad
This is the story of the blessing of your Lord to His servant Zachariah
When he quietly called his Lord
and said My Lord my bones have become feeble and my hair has turned white with age Yet I have never been deprived in receiving from You the answer to my prayers
I am afraid of what my kinsmen will do after my death and my wife is barren
Lord grant me a son
who will be my heir and the heir of the family of Jacob
Lord make him a person who will please you
We answered his prayers with the glad news of the birth of a son by the name of John and told him We have never given such a name to anyone else
He said Lord how can I have a son
My wife is barren and I have reached an extremely old age
The angel said This is true but your Lord says For Me it is easy I created you when you did not exist
Zachariah asked Lord show me evidence if this is a heavenly news
The Lord said The evidence for it is that you must not speak to any mortal though you are in good health for three nights and days
Zachariah came out to his people from place of worship and inspired them to glorify the Lord both in the morning and evening
We commanded John Zachariah s son to follow the guidance of the Lord with due steadfastness
To John We gave knowledge and wisdom to John during his childhood
We gave him compassion and purity
He was a pious human being
kind to his parents not arrogant or a rebellious person
He was born and died in peace and will be brought back to life again in peace
Muhammad mention in the Book the Quran the story of Mary how she left her family and started living in a solitary place to the East
out of her people s sight
We sent Our Spirit to her who stood before her in the shape of a well formed human being
Mary said Would that the Beneficent God would protect me from you
Leave me alone if you are a God fearing person
He said I am the Messengers of your Lord I have come to give you a purified son
She said How can I have a son when no mortal has touched me nor am I an unchaste woman
He said This is true but your Lord says It is very easy for Me
We have decided to give you a son as evidence of Our existence for human beings and a mercy from Us
This is a decree already ordained
She conceived the child and retreated with him to a distant and solitary place
When she started to experience the pain of of childbirth labor by the trunk of a palm tree in sadness she said Would that I had died long before and passed into oblivion
Then she heard the baby saying Do not be sad Your Lord has caused a stream to run at your feet
If you shake the trunk of the palm tree it will provide you with fresh ripe dates
Eat drink and rejoice
Should you see a person going by tell him that on this day you have promised the Beneficent God to fast and never talk to any human being
She took him to her people and they said Mary this is indeed an strange thing
Aaron s sister your father was not a bad man nor was your mother unchaste
She pointed to the baby and referred them to him for their answer
They said How can we talk to a baby in the cradle
He said I am the servant of God
He has given me the Book and has appointed me to be a Prophet
He has blessed me no matter where I dwell commanded me to worship Him and pay the religious tax for as long as I live
He has commanded me to be good to my parents and has not made me an arrogant rebellious person
I was born with peace and I shall die and be brought to life again with peace
Such was the true story of Jesus the son of Mary about which they dispute bitterly
God is too Exalted to have a son
When He decides to bring some thing into existence He needs only command it to exist and it comes into existence
Baby Jesus said Worship God who is my Lord as well as yours
This is the straight path
The followers of Jesus turned themselves into quarrelling sects
The disbelievers shall face a woeful condition on the great Day of Judgment
Muhammad how clearly they will hear and see on the day when they will be brought into Our presence
Today the wrong doers are in manifest error
Warn them of the woeful day when the final decree will be issued they are neglectful and faithless
We are the heirs of the earth and those living in it will all return to Us
Mention the story of Abraham the truthful Prophet in the Book the Quran
who asked his father Father why do you worship something that can neither hear nor see nor help you at all
Father I have received the knowledge which has not been given to you
Follow me I shall guide you to the right path
Father do not worship satan he has disobeyed the Beneficent God
Father I am afraid that the Beneficent God s torment will strike you and you will become a friend of satan
His father replied Abraham are you telling me to giveup my gods
If you will not stop this I shall stone you to death
Leave my house and do not come back again
Abraham said Peace be with you I shall ask my Lord to forgive you He has been gracious to me
I shall stay away from you and what you worship instead of God
I worship my Lord and hope that my prayers will not be ignored
When Abraham rejected his people and what they worshipped instead of God We gave him Isaac and Jacob and made both of them Prophets
We granted them Our blessing and high renown
Muhammad mention in the Book the Quran the story of Moses
Moses was a sincere person a Messengers and a Prophet
We called him from the right side of Mount Sinai and drew him close for communication
Out of Our mercy We gave him his brother Aaron who himself was a Prophet
Mention in the Book the Quran the story of Ishmael he was true to his promise a Messengers and a Prophet
He would order his people to worship God and pay the religious tax
His Lord was pleased with him
Mention in the Book the Quran the story of Idris Enoch he was a truthful Prophet
We granted him a high position
These were the Prophets from the offspring of Adam from those who embarked with Noah and from the offspring of Abraham and Israel
God guided them and chose them for His favor
Whenever they would hear the revelations of the Beneficent God they would bow down in prostration with tears
They were succeeded by a generation who neglected their prayers and followed their worldly desires
They will certainly be lost
but those among them who repent and become righteously striving believers will be admitted to the gardens without experiencing any injustice
They will be admitted to the garden of Eden which is the unseen promise of the Beneficent God to His servants
The promise of God will certainly come true
They will not hear therein any meaningless words They will be greeted by the angels with Peace be with you and they will receive their sustenance both in the mornings and evenings
Such are the gardens which We will give to Our Godfearing servants as their inherited property
Muhammad we the angels do not come to you without being commanded by your Lord to do so To Him belongs all that is before us behind us and in between Your Lord is not forgetful
He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
Worship Him and be steadfast in your worship of Him none is equal to Him
The human being says Shall I be brought to life again after I will die
Does he not remember that We created him when he did not exist
By your Lord We will bring them back to life with satan and gather them around hell in large groups
Then We will separate from every group those who were strongly rebellious against the Beneficent God
We know best who deserves greater suffering in hell fire
It is the inevitable decree of your Lord that every one of you will be taken to hell
We will save the pious ones from the hell fire and leave the unjust people therein in crowded groups
When Our revelations are recited to them the unbelievers say to the faithful ones Which of us is more prosperous
How many generations of greater prosperity and splendor have We destroyed before them
Muhammad tell them The Beneficent God gives respite to those who have gone astray only until they face the torment with which they were threatened or to the Day of Judgment
Then they will find out who will have the most miserable place and the weakest forces
God further enlightens those who seek guidance
To those who do charitable deeds which produce continuing benefits your Lord will give a better reward and a better place in Paradise
Note the words of the disbeliever I shall certainly be given wealth and children
Has he the knowledge of the unseen or has the Beneficent God established such a binding agreement with Him
Absolutely not We will record his words and prolong his punishment
All that he speaks of will belong to Us and he will come into Our presence all alone
They have sought honor from other gods instead of God
In fact they can have no honor their gods will renounce their worship of idols and will turn against them
Do you not realize that We have sent Satan to incite the unbelievers to sin
Muhammad exercise patience We have given them respite only for an appointed time
On the Day of Judgment when the pious people will be brought into the presence of the Beneficent God as the guests of honor
and the criminals will be driven and thrown into hell
no one will be able to intercede for the others except those whom the Beneficent God has given authority
They have said that the Beneficent God has given birth to a son
This is certainly a monstrous lie
This would almost cause the heavens to rent apart the earth to cleave asunder and the mountains to crumble down in fragments
to ascribe a son to the Beneficent God
The Beneficent God is too Exalted to have a son
All that is in the heavens and the earth will return to the Beneficent God as His submissive servants
He has counted and enumerated them one by one
Everyone on the Day of Judgment will individually come into the presence of God
To the righteously striving believers God will grant love
Muhammad We have given you the Book the Quran in your own language so that you could easily give the glad news to the pious ones and warn the quarrelsome ones
How many generations living before them did We destroy
Do you find anyone of them around or do you even hear any word from them
Ta Ha
We have sent the Quran only as reminder
for those who have fear of disobeying God not to make you Muhammad miserable
It is a revelation from the Creator of the earth and the high heavens
The Beneficent God is dominant over the Throne of the realm
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth all that lies between them and lies below the earth
Whether or not you express your thoughts in words God certainly knows all unspoken thoughts and all that is even more difficult to find
God is the only Lord and to Him belong all the exalted Names
Muhammad have you heard the story of Moses
When he saw the fire he said to his family Wait here for I can see a fire Perhaps I shall bring you a burning torch or find a way to some fire
When he came near the fire he was called Moses
I Am your Lord
Take off your shoes you are in the holy valley of Tuwa
I have chosen you as My Messengers
Listen to the revelation
I Am the only God
Worship Me and be steadfast in prayer to have My name always in your mind
Although it is certain that the Day of Judgment will come I prefer to keep it almost a secret so that every soul will receive the recompense for what it has done on its own
Let not the unbelievers who follow their vain desires make you forget the Day of Judgment lest you will perish
The Lord asked Moses what is in your right hand
He replied It is my staff
I lean on it bring down leaves for my sheep with it and I need it for other reasons
The Lord said Moses throw it on the ground
Moses threw it on the ground and suddenly he saw that it was a moving serpent
The Lord said Hold the serpent and do not be afraid We will bring it back to its original form
Now as another Sign place your hand under your arm and it will come out sheer white without harm or stain
This We have done to show you some of Our greater miracles
Go to the Pharaoh he has become a rebel
Moses said Lord grant me courage
Make my task easy
and my tongue fluent
so that they may understand me
Appoint a deputy for me from my own people
Let it be my brother Aaron
to support me
Let him be my partner in this task
so that we may glorify
and remember you often
You are Well Aware of our situation
The Lord said Moses your request is granted
It is the second time that We have bestowed upon you Our favor
Remember when We inspired your mother with a certain inspiration
to lace her child in a chest and throw it into the sea which would hurl it towards the shore
Then an enemy of Mine who was also the enemy of the child would pick it up from there
I made you attractive and loveable so that you would be reared before My own eyes
Your sister went to them and said May I show you someone who will nurse this child
We returned you to your mother to make her rejoice and forget her grief
You slew a man and We saved you from trouble
We tried you through various trials
Then you stayed some years with the people of Midian Shu ayb and his family and after that you came back to Egypt as was ordained
I chose you for Myself
Go with your brother Take My miracles and do not be reluctant in preaching My message
Go both of you to the Pharaoh he has become a rebel
Both of you must speak with him in a gentle manner so that perhaps he may come to himself or have fear of God
They said Lord we are afraid of his transgression and rebellion against us
The Lord replied them Do not be afraid I Am with you all the time listening and seeing
They came to the Pharaoh and told him that they were the Messengerss of his Lord and that they wanted him to let the Israelites go with them and stop afflicting the Israelites with torment
They told the Pharaoh We have brought miracles from Our Creator
Peace be with those who follow the right guidance
It is revealed to us that those who call our message a lie or turn away from it will face the torment
The Pharaoh asked them Who is your Lord
They replied Our Lord is the One Who has created all things and has given guidance
He then asked What do you know about the past generations
Moses replied The knowledge about it is with my Lord in the Book
My Lord is free from error and forgetfulness
It is God who has made the earth as a cradle for you with roads for you to travel
He has sent water from the sky to produce various pairs of plants
Consume them as food or for grazing your cattle
In this there is evidence of the existence of God for the people of reason
We have created you from the earth to which We will return you and will bring you back to life again
We showed the Pharaoh all of Our miracles but he called them lies and turned away from them
He said to Moses Have you come to expel us from our land through your magic
We shall also answer you by magic Let us make an appointment for a contest among us and let each of us be present at a certain time in the appointed place
Moses said Let the contest take place on the Day of Feast so that all the people can come together during the brightness of the day
The Pharaoh returned to organize his plans and then attended the appointment
Moses told them the magicians Woe to you if you invent falsehood against God you will be destroyed by the torment
Whoever invents falsehood against God will certainly be lost
They started arguing and whispering to each other
and said These two people are magicians
They want to expel you from your land through their magic and to destroy your own tradition
Bring together your devices and come forward in ranks the winner will certainly have great happiness
They said Moses would you be the first to show your skill or should we be the first to throw down our devices
Moses said You throw first
When they did their ropes and staffs through their magic seemed to be moving
Moses felt afraid within himself
We told him Do not be afraid for you will be the winner
Throw down what is in your right hand and it will swallow up all that they have performed theirs is only a magical performance
Magicians can find no happiness in whatever they do
The magicians bowed down in prostration saying We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron
The Pharaoh said Since you believed in him without my permission then Moses certainly must be your chief who has taught you magic
I shall cut your hands and feet on alternate sides and crucify you on the trunk of the palmtree
You shall certainly find which among us can afflict a more severe and lasting punishment
They the magicians said We would never prefer you to the miracles that we have seen or to our Creator
Do what you want
This life is only for a short time
We have faith in our Lord so that He will forgive our sins and our magical performances that you forced us to show God is better than all things and His rewards last longer
The dwelling place of one who comes into the presence of his Lord as a criminal will be hell wherein he will never die nor enjoy his life
One who comes into the presence of his Lord with faith and righteous deeds
will be rewarded by high status in the gardens of Eden wherein streams flow
Such will be the reward of those who purify themselves
We sent revelations to Moses telling him Travel with My servants during the night and strike a dry road across the sea for them
Have no fear of being overtaken by the Pharaoh nor of anything else
The Pharaoh and his army chased Moses and his people but were drowned by the sea
The Pharaoh and his people had gone away from guidance
Children of Israel We saved you from your enemy and promised to settle you on the right side of the peaceful Mount Tur Sinai
and We sent you manna and quails
I allowed you to consume the pure sustenance which We had given you but not to become rebels lest you become subject to My wrath Whoever becomes subject to My wrath will certainly be destroyed
The Lord asked Moses what made you attend your appointment with Me before your people
Moses replied They are just behind me
I came earlier to seek Your pleasure
The Lord said We tested your people after you left them and the Samiri made them go astray
Moses sad and angry returned to his people saying My people did not the Lord make you a gracious promise
Why did you disregard your appointment with me
Was it because of the long time or did you want to become subject to the wrath of your Lord
They replied We did not go against our promise with you out of our own accord
We were forced to carry people s ornaments
We threw them away and so did the Samiri
Then the Samiri forged the body of a motionless calf which gave out a hollow sound The people said This is your Lord and the Lord of Moses whom he Moses forgot to mention
Did they not consider that the calf could not give them any answer nor it could harm or benefit them
Aaron had told them before My people you are deceived by the calf
Your Lord is the Beneficent God
Follow me and obey my orders
They said We shall continue worshipping the calf until Moses comes back
Then Moses asked Aaron What made you not follow me when you saw them in error
Did you disobey my orders
Aaron replied Son of my mother do not seize me by my beard or head
I was afraid that you might consider me responsible for causing discord among the children of Israel and would not pay attention to my words
Moses asked Samiri what were your motives
He replied I had the skill of carving which they did not have
I followed some of the Messengers s Moses tradition but I then ignored it
Thus my soul prompted me to carve a golden calf with an artificial hollow sound
Moses said Go away
Throughout your life you will not be able to let anyone touch you
This will be your punishment in this life
The time for your final punishment is inevitable
You will never be able to avoid it
Look at your god which you have been worshipping
We will burn it in the fire and scatter its ashes into the sea
Your Lord is the One who is the only God and He has the knowledge of all things
Thus We tell you Muhammad the stories of the past and We have given you the Quran
Whoever disregards the Quran will be heavily burdened with sin on the Day of Judgment
with which he will live forever On the Day of Judgment it will be a terrible load for him to carry
On the day when the trumpet will be sounded We will raise the criminals from their graves and their eyes will be turned blue and blind
They will slowly talk to each other and say Our life on earth was as short as ten days
We know best what they say
The moderate ones among them will say You did not live on earth for more than a day
Muhammad they will ask you about the mountains
Tell them My Lord will grind them to powder
and leave them so smoothly levelled
that you will see no depression or elevation in it
On that day they will follow their caller without deviation Their voices will be low in the presence of the Beneficent God
You will hear nothing but the tread of the marching feet
On that day no one s intercession will be of any benefit unless he has received permission from the Beneficent God and whose word is acceptable to Him
God knows all that is in front of them and behind them and they can not encompass His knowledge
Faces will be humble before the Everlasting and the Selfexisting God
Despair will strike those who are loaded with the burden of injustice
The righteously striving believers should have no fear of being treated with injustice or inequity
We have revealed the Quran in the Arabic language containing various warnings so that it may cause them to have fear of God or take heed
God is the Most High and the True King
Muhammad do not be hasty in reading the Quran to the people before the revelation has been completed
Say My Lord grant me more knowledge
We had commanded Adam certain matters
He forgot Our commandment and We did not find in him the determination to fulfil Our commandments
When We told the angels to prostrate before Adam they all obeyed except Iblis satan who refused
We said Adam this satan is your enemy and the enemy of your spouse
Let him not expel you and your spouse from Paradise lest you plunge into misery
In Paradise you will experience no hunger nakedness
thirst or exposure to the hot Sun
Satan trying to seduce him said Adam do you want me to show you the Tree of Eternity and the Everlasting Kingdom
Adam and his wife ate fruits from the tree and found themselves naked
Then they started to cover themselves with the leaves from the garden
Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray
His Lord forgave him accepted his repentance and gave him guidance
God then told them Get out of here all of you you are each other s enemies
When My guidance comes to you those who follow it will not go astray nor will they endure any misery
Whoever ignores My guidance will live a woeful life and will be brought in Our presence blind on the Day of Judgment
He will say My Lord why have you brought me back to life blind before I could see
The Lord will say This is true But just as you forgot Our revelations that had come to you so too are you forgotten on this day
Thus We recompense those who are unjust and have no faith in Our revelations
The torment in the life to come will be more severe and last longer
Is it not a warning for them to see how many generations living before them We destroyed and how they are now walking in their ruins
In this there is the evidence of the Truth for the people of reason
Had not the word of your Lord been decreed otherwise the unbelievers deserved immediate punishment The appointed time for their punishment will inevitably come
Muhammad have patience with what they say glorify your Lord and always praise Him before sunrise sunset in some hours of the night and at both the beginning and end of the day so that perhaps you will please your Lord
Do not be envious of what We have given to some people as means of enjoyment and worldly delight
Such means are a trial for them but the reward that you will receive from your Lord will be far better and everlasting
Instruct your family to pray and to be steadfast in their worship
We do not ask any sustenance from you it is We who give you sustenance
Know that piety will have a happy end
They have said Why has he Muhammad not brought some miracle from his Lord
Have they not received the previously revealed heavenly Books as the evidence of the Truth
Had We destroyed them with a torment before the coming of Muhammad they would have said Lord would that you had sent us a Messengers so that we could have followed Your revelations before being humiliated and disgraced
Muhammad tell them Everyone is waiting
Wait and you shall know very soon who will be the followers of the right path with the right guidance
The people s day of reckoning is drawing closer yet they are heedlessly neglectful
Whenever a new revelation comes to them from their Lord they listen to it in a playful manner
and their hearts are preoccupied with trivial matters
The unjust ones whisper to each other and say Is he Muhammad more than a mere mortal like you
How can you follow that which you know is only a magic
The Lord said Tell them Muhammad My Lord knows all that is said in the heavens and the earth
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
They have said It the Quran is only the result of some confused dreams
He is only a poet He should show us some miracles as the ancient Prophets had done
The people of the town whom We had destroyed also had no faith
Will these people then believe in God
The messengers that We had sent before you were only men to whom We had given revelation
Ask the People of the Book if you do not know
We had not made them such bodies that would not eat any food nor were they immortal
Our promise to them came true and We saved them and those whom We wanted but destroyed the unjust people
We have sent a Book the Quran which is an honor for you
Will you then not understand
How many unjust towns did We destroy and replace them with other nations
When they found Our torment approaching them they started to run away from the town
We told them Do not run away
Come back to your luxuries and your houses so that you can be questioned
They said Woe to us
We have been unjust
Such was what they continued to say until We mowed them down and made them completely extinct
We did not create the heavens and the earth just for fun
Had We wanted to play games We could have certainly done so with things at hand
We bring forward the Truth to crush and destroy falsehood it is doomed to be banished
Woe to you for your way of thinking about God
To Him belongs all those who are in the heavens and the earth
Those who are closer to Him are not too proud to worship Him nor do they get tired of worshipping
They glorify Him day and night without fail
Have they chosen deities from earth
Can such deities give life to anyone
Had there been other deities in the heavens and the earth besides God both the heavens and the earth would have been destroyed
God the Lord of the Throne is too Glorious to be as they think He is
He will not be questioned about anything He does but all people will be questioned about their deeds
Have they chosen other gods besides God Muhammad ask them Show the proof in support of such belief
This is the Quran which tells us about the beliefs of the people in my time and those who lived before me Most of them do not know
Moreover the truth is that they neglect the question of belief altogether
To all the Messengers that were sent before you We revealed that I am the only God to be worshipped
They said The Beneficent God has given birth to a son
He is too Exalted to give birth to a son
Those whom they think are God s sons are only His honorable servants
These servants do not speak before He speaks They simply act according to His orders
He knows all that is in front of them and all that is behind them
These servants of God will not intercede with Him for anyone without His permission and they tremble in awe before His greatness
The recompense of those of them who say that they are the Lord instead of God will be hell thus do We recompense the unjust ones
Have the unbelievers not ever considered that the heavens and the earth were one piece and that We tore them apart from one another
From water We have created all living things
Will they then have no faith
We placed firm mountains on earth lest it would shake them away We made wide roads for them so that they might have the right guidance
We made the sky above them as a wellguarded ceiling but they have neglected the evidence of Our existence therein
It is God who has created the night the day the Sun and Moon and has made them swim in a certain orbit
We made no mortal before you immortal
Will they become immortal after you die
Every soul has to experience the taste of death We test you with both hardships and blessings
In the end you will all return to Us
Muhammad whenever the unbelievers see you they think that you deserve nothing more than to be mocked They say Is it he Muhammad who speaks against your gods
But they themselves have no faith at all in the Beneficent God
The human being is created hasty Tell them Do not be hasty for God will soon show you the evidence of His existence
They say When shall the Day of Judgment come to pass if you are true in your claim
Would that the unbelievers knew that no one would protect their faces and backs against the fire nor they would be helped
The fire will suddenly strike and confound them
They will not be able to repel it nor will they be given any respite
They mocked the Messengers who were sent before you thus the torment which they had ridiculed encompassed them all
Ask them Who can protect them from the wrath of the Beneficent God during the night and day
Yet they are neglectful about their Lord
Can their gods protect them against Us
Their gods have no power even to help themselves nor are they safe from Our retribution
We have been providing these men and their fathers with the means of enjoyment for a long time
Have they not ever considered that We populated the earth and then caused many of the inhabitants to pass away
Can they have any success in their wickedness
Muhammad tell them I am warning you by revelation alone
The deaf do not hear any call when they are warned
If a blast of the torment of your Lord strikes them they will say Woe to us
We have been unjust people
We shall maintain proper justice on the Day of Judgment
No soul will be wronged the least
For a deed even as small as a mustard seed one will duly be recompensed
We are efficient in maintaining the account
To Moses and Aaron We granted the criteria of discerning right from wrong and We gave them the light and a reminder to the pious ones
who fear their unseen Lord and are anxious about the Day of Judgment
This Quran which We have revealed is a blessed reminder
Will you then deny it
To Abraham We gave the right guidance and We knew him very well
Abraham asked his father and his people What are these statues which you worship
They replied We found our fathers worshipping them
He said Both you and your fathers have certainly been in error
They exclaimed Have you brought the Truth or are you joking
He said Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth
It was He who created them and I testify to this fact
Abraham said to himself By God I will devise a plan against their idols when they are away
He broke all the idols into pieces except the biggest among them so that perhaps people would refer to it
When the people came to the temple and saw the broken idols they asked each other Who has done this to our gods He certainly is an unjust person
Some of them said We heard a youth called Abraham speaking against the idols
Their chiefs said Bring him before the eyes of the people and let them testify that he has spoken against the idols
They asked Abraham did you do this to our idols
He replied I think the biggest among them has broken the smaller ones
Ask them if they are able to speak
Thereupon they realized their own foolishness and said We ourselves are wrongdoers
With their heads cast down they said Abraham you know that idols do not speak How then can you ask such a question
He said Do you instead of God worship things that can neither harm nor benefit you
Woe to you for what you worship instead of God
Have you no understanding
They said Burn him to ashes if you want to help your gods
We said to the fire Be cool and peaceful with Abraham
They had devised an evil plan against Abraham but We turned it into failure
We took Abraham and Lot safely to the land in which We had sent blessings to the worlds
We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a gift and helped both of them to become righteous people
We appointed them as leaders to guide the people through Our command and sent them revelation to strive for good deeds worship their Lord and pay religious tax
Both of them were Our worshipping servants
To Lot We gave knowledge and wisdom and saved him from the people of the town who were committing indecent acts
They were certainly a bad and sinful people
We encompassed him in Our mercy he was a righteous man
We answered the prayer of Noah who had prayed to Us before and saved him and his followers from the great disaster
We helped him against the people who said Our revelations were mere lies
They were a bad people and We drowned them all
David and Solomon were trying to settle the case of the people s sheep that grazed in a cornfield at night We witnessed their decree in that matter
We made Solomon understand the law about the case and gave both David and Solomon knowledge and wisdom
We made the mountains and birds glorify the Lord along with David
We had also done to him such favors before
We taught him the art of making coats of mail so that you could protect yourselves during a war
Will you then give thanks
We made subservient to Solomon the swift wind that blew on his command to the land in which We had sent blessings
We have the knowledge of all things
We subdued the devils who would dive into the sea for him and perform other tasks for Solomon We kept them in his service
When Job prayed Lord I have been afflicted with hardships
Have mercy on me You are the Most Merciful of those who have mercy
We answered his prayer relieved him from his hardships brought his family back to him and gave him twice as much property as that which was destroyed It was a mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers
Ismael Idris and Dhul Kifl all were people of great patience
We encompassed them in Our mercy they were righteous people
Dhun Nun went away in anger and thought that We would never have power over him but in darkness he cried Lord You are the Only God whom I glorify I have certainly done wrong to myself so forgive me
We answered his prayer and saved him from his grief
Thus We save the faithful ones
Zachariah prayed Lord do not leave me alone without offspring although you are the best heir
We answered his prayer and granted him his son John by making his wife fruitful
They were people who would compete with each other in good deeds and pray to Us with love and reverence
With Us they were all humble people
Into the woman who maintained her chastity We breathed Our Spirit and made her and her son a miracle for all people
People you are one nation and I am your Lord
Worship Me
People have divided themselves into many sects but all will return to Us
The reward of the righteously striving believers will not be neglected
We are keeping the record of their good deeds
The people whom We destroyed can never return to this world
until Gog and Magog are let loose to rush down from the hills
The Day of Judgment will then draw near and the unbelievers will stare amazedly and cry Woe to us
We had neglected this day
We have done wrong
They will be told You and what you had worshipped instead of God will be the fuel of hell
Had the idols been true lords they would not have gone to hell
All of you will live therein forever
They will groan in pain therein but no one will listen to them
But those to whom We have already promised blessings will be far away from hell
They will not even hear the slightest sound from it while enjoying the best that they can wish for in their everlasting life
They will not be affected by the great terror The angels will come to them with this glad news This is your day which was promised to you
This will happen on the day when We roll up the heavens as if it were a written scroll and bring it back into existence just as though We had created it for the first time This is what We have promised and We have always been true to Our promise
We have written in the psalms which We had revealed after the Torah that the earth will be given to Our righteous servants as their inheritance
This is a lesson for those who worship God
Muhammad We have sent you for no other reason but to be a mercy for mankind
Say It is revealed to me that there is only one Lord
Will you then submit yourselves to His will
If they turn away tell them I have warned every one of you equally
I do not know when the torment which you have to suffer will take place
God knows well all that is spoken aloud and all that you hide
I do not know why God has commanded me to warn you of the torment Perhaps it is a trial for you and a respite for an appointed time
He also said Lord judge us with Truth
Our Lord is the Beneficent One whose help I ask against the blasphemies you say about Him
People have fear of your Lord the quake of the physical realm at the Hour of Doom will be terribly violent
When that hour comes every breastfeeding mother will drop her baby out of fear and every pregnant female will cast off her burden
You will see the people behaving as though they were drunk while in fact they are not drunk
They only will look such because of the severity of God s torment
Some people argue about God without knowledge and follow every rebellious devil
It has been decided that satan will mislead and submit anyone who establishes friendship with him to the torment of the burning fire
People if you have doubts about the Resurrection you must know that We created you from clay that was turned into a living germ
This was developed into a clot of blood which was made into a well formed and partly shapeless lump of flesh This is how We show you that resurrection is not more difficult for Us than your creation
We cause whatever We want to stay in the womb for an appointed time We then take you out of the womb as a baby so that you may grow up and receive strength
Some of you may then die and others may grow to a very old age and lose your memory
You may see the earth as a barren land but when we send rain it starts to stir and swell and produce various pairs of attractive herbs
This is because God is the Supreme Truth who gives life to the dead and who has power over all things
There is no doubt about the coming of the Hour of Doom and that God will raise every one from their graves
Some people argue about God without knowledge guidance and an enlightening Book
They turn away from the Truth to lead people away from the path of God
Their share in this world will be disgrace and on the Day of Judgment a burning torment
They will be told This is the result of what your hands have wrought God is certainly not unjust to His servants
Some people worship God to achieve worldly gains
They are confident when they are prosperous but when they face hardships they turn away from worship
They are lost in this life and will be lost in the life to come
Such loss is indeed destructive
They worship things instead of God which can neither harm them nor benefit them
This is indeed to stray far away from the right path
Their worship of such things in which there is no hope for any benefit can only harm them
How terrible is such a guardian and companion
God will admit the righteously striving believers to the gardens wherein streams flow
God has all the power to do whatever He wants
Those who thought that God would never grant victory to Muhammad in this world nor in the life hereafter and now that he is victorious should hang themselves by the necks from the ceiling then cut the rope and see if this can do away with what has enraged them
We have revealed the Quran which contains authoritative verses
God guides only those whom He wants
On the Day of Judgment God will make truth and falsehood clearly distinct from each other to the believers the Jews the Sabeans the Christian the Zoroastrians and the Pagans on the Day of Judgment
God is a Witness to all things
Have you not considered that those in the heavens and the earth the Sun the Moon the Stars the mountains the trees the animals and many people all bow down to God
But many people deserve His torment
No one can give honor to whomever God has insulted
God has all the power to do what He wants
Those who prostrate themselves before God and those who do not are two groups who dispute with each other about their Lord
For the unbelievers the garment of fire has already been prepared Boiling water will be poured upon their heads
It will melt their skins and all that is in their bellies
They will be subdued by iron rods
Whenever in anguish they will try to come out of hell they will be returned therein to suffer the burning torment
God will admit the righteously striving believers to the gardens wherein streams flow
There they will be decked with gold bracelets pearls and garments of silk
for they were guided to speak the noblest words and follow the praiseworthy path
A painful torment awaits the pagans who create obstacles in the way that leads to God and the Sacred Mosque which We have made for those who dwell nearby and foreigners alike and those who commit evil and injustice therein
When We prepared for Abraham the place to build the Sacred House We told him not to consider anything equal to Me and to keep the House clean for those walking around it those standing bowing down and prostrating in prayer
We commanded Abraham Call people for hajj an act of worship accomplished by visiting the sacred sites in Mecca They will come on foot and on lean camels from all the distant quarters
to see their benefits commemorate the name of God during the appointed days and offer the sacrifice of the cattle that God has given them They themselves should consume part of the sacrificial flesh and give the rest to the destitute and needy people
Let the pilgrims then neatly dress themselves fulfil their vows and walk seven times around the Kabah
Such are the regulations of hajj
To respect the prohibitions of God is a virtuous deed in the sight of one s Lord
Consuming the flesh of certain animals is made lawful for you
Stay away from wickedness idols and false words
As the upright servants of God do not consider anything equal to God
To consider things equal to God is like one falling from the sky who is snatched away by the birds or carried away by a strong wind to a far distant place
To respect the symbols of God is the sign of a pious heart
There are benefits for you in the sacrificial offerings of God until the appointed time when you slaughter them as your offering near the Ancient House
To every nation We have given certain sacrificial rituals Let them consecrate their sacrificial animals with His Name
Your God is One God and you must submit yourselves to His will
Muhammad give the glad news of God s mercy to the devoted servants of God
Those whose hearts are filled with awe on hearing about God who exercise patience in hardships who are steadfast in prayer and who spend their property for the cause of God
For you We have made the sacrificial camel one of the reminders of God
It also has other benefits for you
Consecrate it with the Name of God when it is steadily standing
When it is slaughtered consume its flesh and give part of it to the needy who do and those do not ask for help from others
Thus We have made the camel subservient to you so that perhaps you may give thanks
It is not the flesh and blood of your sacrifice that pleases God
What pleases God is your piety
God has made subservient to you the sacrificial animals so that perhaps you will glorify Him He is guiding you
Muhammad give the glad news of God s mercy to the righteous people
God defends the believers but He does not love any of the treacherous ungrateful ones
Permission to take up arms is hereby granted to those who are attacked they have suffered injustice
God has all the power to give victory
to those who were unjustly expelled from their homes only because they said God is our Lord
Had it not been for God s repelling some people through the might of the others the monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which God is very often worshipped would have been utterly destroyed
God shall certainly help those who help Him
He is Allpowerful and Majestic
He will certainly help those who if given power in the land will worship God through prayer pay the religious tax enjoin others do good and prevent them from committing evil
The consequence of all things is in the hands of God
If they have called you Muhammad a liar remember that the people of Noah Ad Thamud
and the people of Abraham Lot
Midian and Moses had also called their Prophets liars
I gave respite to the unbelievers then sized them with torment
How terrible was that torment
How many were the unjust dwellers of the towns that We destroyed From their trellises to their lofty mansions all were toppled and their wells were abandoned
Have they not travelled sufficiently in the land to have understanding hearts and listening ears
It is their hearts which are blind not their ears
They want you to bring upon them their punishment without delay
God never disregards His promise
One day for God is equal to a thousand years for you
To how many unjust towns have We given respite and then sized with torment
To Me do all things return
Muhammad tell them People I am giving you a clear warning
The righteously striving believers will receive forgiveness and honorable sustenance
Those who try to challenge Our miracles will be the dwellers of hell
Satan would try to tamper with the desires of every Prophet or Messenger whom We sent
Then God would remove Satan s temptations and strengthen His revelations
God is Allknowing and Allwise
He would make Satan s temptations a trial for those whose hearts are hard and sick
The wrongdoers are far away from the Lord
so that those who have received knowledge would know and believe that whatever happens with the Prophets and Messengers is the Truth from their Lord and will believe it
This will cause their hearts to become filled with awe
God guides the believers to the right path
The unbelievers will continue to doubt the Quran until the Hour of Doom suddenly sizes them or the torment of the last day strikes them
On that day it is God who will be the Absolute King and Judge of mankind
The righteously striving believers will go to Paradise
and the unbelievers who called Our revelations lies will suffer humiliating torment
Those who abandoned their homes for the cause of God and who then died or were murdered will receive honorable sustenance from God He is the Most Generous and Munificent
God will certainly admit them to a pleasant dwelling
God is Allknowing and Forbearing
One who is wronged and who retaliates by that which is equal to his suffering God will certainly help him He is Allpardoning and Allforgiving
God causes the night to enter the day and the day to enter the night He is Allhearing and Allaware
God is the Supreme Truth and whatever they worship instead of Him is falsehood God is most Exalted and most Great
Have you not seen that God has sent water from the sky and has made the earth green all over
He is Kind and Allaware
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
Have you not seen that God through His command has made all that is in the earth and the ships that sail on the sea subservient to you He prevents the sky from falling on the earth unless He decides otherwise
God is Compassionate and Merciful to mankind
It is He who has given you life He will make you die and will make you live again Surely the human being is ungrateful
We enjoined every nation with certain worship acts which they perform
The unbelievers must not dispute with you about the manner of your worship
Invite them to follow the right path of the Lord
If they still dispute with you about your worship tell them God knows best what you do
He will issue His decree about your differences on the Day of Judgment
Do you not know that God knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
His decree is already recorded in the Book and issuing such a Judgment is not difficult for Him at all
They worship things instead of God that have received no authority from the heavens nor have they any knowledge of such authority
The unjust people will have no one to help them
When Our authoritative revelations are recited to the unbelievers you can clearly read the dislike on their faces
They almost attack those who read Our revelations to them
Say to them Should I tell you about what is the worst thing for you than these revelations
It is the fire which God has prepared for the unbelievers
What a terrible destination
People listen to this parable Those whom you worship instead of God do not have the power to create even a fly even though all of them would come together for the task
If the fly was to snatch something from them they would not be able to rescue it from the fly
How feeble are such worshippers and that which they worship
They have not revered God properly
God is Allpowerful and Majestic
God chooses Messengers from both angels and human beings
God is Allhearing and Allaware
God knows all that they have and all that is behind them and to Him do all things return
Believers worship your Lord bow down and prostrate yourselves before Him and do virtuous deeds so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness
Strive steadfastly for the Cause of God
He has chosen you but has not imposed on you hardship in your religion the noble religion of your father Abraham
God named you Muslims before and in this Book so that the Messenger will witness your actions and will be the witness over mankind
Be steadfast in your prayer pay the religious tax and seek protection from God He is your Guardian a gracious Guardian and Helper
Triumphant indeed are the believers
who are submissive to God in their prayers
who avoid impious talks
pay their religious tax
and restrain their carnal desires
except with their spouses and slavegirls
The practice of carnal relations is lawful with them
Those who desire to go beyond such limits they commit transgression
those who are true to their trust
to their promise
and who are steadfast in their prayer
These are the heirs of Paradise wherein they will live forever
We have created the human being from an extract of clay
which was then turned into a living germ and placed in safe depository
The living germ then was turned into a shapeless lump of flesh from which bones were formed The bones then were covered with flesh
At this stage We caused it to become another creature All blessings belong to God the best Creator
Thereafter you will certainly die
and you will be brought back to life again on the Day of Resurrection
We have created seven heavens above you and have never been neglectful to Our Creation
We have sent a measure of water from the sky to stay on earth and We have the power to take it away
We have established for you gardens of palm trees and vineyards with this water with many fruits for you to consume
We have also created for you the tree that grows on Mount Sinai which produces oil and relish for those who use it
There is a lesson for you concerning cattle
We provide you with drink from their bellies and many other benefits
You can consume them as meat
You are carried by the animals on land and by the ships in the sea
We sent Noah to his people who said My people worship God for He is your only Lord Will you then not have fear of Him
The chiefs of the unbelievers said to the others He is a mere mortal like you
He wants only to be superior to you
Had God wanted He would have sent the angels instead of him
We have never heard from our fathers anything like what he says
He is only an insane person
Wait for some time
Perhaps he will come to his senses
Noah prayed Lord help me they have called me a liar
We inspired him saying Build the Ark before Our eyes and by the instruction of Our revelation
When our decree comes to pass and water comes forth from the Oven embark in the Ark with a pair of every kind of animals and your family except those already doomed to perish
Do not plead with Me for the unjust they will be drowned
When all of you settle in the Ark say Only God Who has saved us from the unjust people deserves all praise
Say Lord grant us a blessed landing from the Ark You are the One who provides the safest landing
In this story there is enough evidence of the Truth thus do We try mankind
We brought another generation into existence after the people of Noah
We sent to them a Messenger from among their own people who told them Worship God He is your only Lord
Will you then not have fear of Him
A group of his people who disbelieved him and had called the Day of Judgment a lie and whom We had made prosperous in this life said He is a mere mortal like you
He eats and drinks as you do
If you follow a mortal like yourselves you will certainly be lost
Does he promise you that after you die and become dust and bones you will be brought back to life again
Such a promise will never come true
This is our only life
We live and will die but we will never be brought back to life again
He is only a man who invents lies against God so have no faith in him
The Messenger prayed Lord help me they have called me a liar
God replied After a very short time they will certainly regret for their deeds
A blast struck them for a just cause and We made them look like withered leaves
God keeps the unjust people away from His mercy
After them We brought another generation into existence
Every nation has an appointed life span
We sent Our messengers one after the other but whenever a Messenger would come to a nation its people would call him a liar and We would destroy one nation after the other thus only their stories were left behind them
God keeps the unbelievers far away from His Mercy
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our miracles and clear authority
to the Pharaoh and his nobles
But they behaved proudly and thought themselves superior people
They said Should we believe in two mere mortals who are like ourselves and whose people are our slaves
They called them liars and consequently were destroyed
We gave the Book to Moses so that perhaps they may have guidance
We made the son of Mary and his mother a miracle and settled them on a high land quite secure and watered by a spring
I told them Messengers eat from the pure things and act righteously I know all that you do
Your religion is one and I am your Lord
Have fear of Me
The people divided themselves into many sects each with their own book and each happy with whatever they had
Muhammad leave them alone in their dark ignorance for an appointed time
Do they think that We are helping them by giving them children and property
We provide them with the means of competing with each other in virtuous deeds but they do not realize this
Only those who are out of fear of Him humble before their Lord
who believe in the revelations of their Lord
who consider nothing equal to their Lord
who spend their property for the cause of God and whose hearts are afraid of their return
to God these are the ones who really compete with each other in virtuous deeds and are the foremost ones in the task
We do not impose on any soul what is beyond its capacity We have the Book which speaks the truth and no injustice will be done to it
In fact the hearts of the unbelievers are in the dark because of their ignorance of real virtue they act against it
But when We will strike with torment those unbelievers who are rich they will start to cry for help
We shall tell them Do not cry for help on this day you will receive none from Us
Our revelations had certainly been recited to you but you turned your backs to them
and arrogantly mocked and reviled them
Was it that you did not give any thought to it the Quran Was it different from what was revealed to your fathers
Or did you not recognize your Messenger and thus denied him Muhammad
or you said that he is possessed by satan
In fact he has brought you the truth but most of you dislike it
Had the truth followed their desires the heavens and the earth and all that is in them would have been destroyed
We sent them the Quran but they ignored it
Do they disbelieve because you asked them for payment
The reward that you will receive from your Lord is the best
He is the best Provider
Muhammad you certainly have called them to the right path
but those who disbelieve the life hereafter deviate from the right path
Even if We were to grant them mercy and rescue them from hardship they would still blindly persist in their rebellion
We struck them with torment but they did not submit themselves to their Lord nor did they make themselves humble
until We opened the gate of greater torment death and they suddenly found themselves in despair
It is God who has created ears eyes and hearts for you
Little are the thanks that you give
It is God who has settled you on the earth and before Him you will all be assembled
It is He who gives life and causes death and it is He who alternates night and day
Will you not then understand
They say exactly the same thing as the people who lived before
They say When we die and become dust and bones shall we then be raised up again
Our fathers and we have been given such promises before
These are no more than ancient legends
Muhammad say to them Tell me if you know to whom does the earth and its contents belong
They will quickly reply It belongs to God
Say Will you not then take heed
Ask them Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Great Throne
They will quickly say It is God
Say Will you not then have fear of Him
Ask them If you have any knowledge in whose hands is the ownership of all things Who is the one who gives protection and yet He Himself is never protected
They will reply spontaneously It is God
Ask them Why has falsehood bewitched you
We have sent them the truth and they certainly are liars
God has never given birth to a son and there is no other god besides Him
If there were each god would have taken away his creatures and claimed superiority over the others
God is too exalted to be as they believe Him to be
He has the knowledge of all seen and unseen things
He is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else
Say Lord if you will afflict them with punishment
exclude me from the unjust people
We have the Power to strike them with torment before your very eyes
Respond to the injustice done to you with the better deed
We know best what they attribute to God
Say Lord I seek your protection against the strong temptations of the devils
I seek your protection should they approach me
When death approaches one of the unbelievers he says Lord send me back again
so that perhaps I shall act righteously for the rest of my life
Although he will say so but his wish will never come true
After death they will be behind a barrier until the day of their resurrection
There will be no kindred relations nor any opportunity to ask about others or seek their assistance after the trumpet has sounded
If the side of ones good deeds weighs heavier on a scale he will have everlasting happiness
but if it weighs less one will be lost forever in hell
The fire will scorch their faces and they will be groaning therein in pain
They will be told Were Our revelations not recited to you and did you not call them lies
They will reply Lord our hardheartedness overcame us and we went astray
Lord take us out of this and if we sin again we shall certainly be unjust
He will say Be quiet and say nothing
There was a group of my servants among you who always prayed Lord forgive us and grant us mercy You are the best of those who show mercy
You mocked and laughed at them until you forgot all about Me
On this day I have given them their reward for their exercising patience and it is they who have triumphed
God will ask them How many years did you live in your graves
They will reply We remained for about a day or part of it but ask those who have kept count
God will say You have indeed remained there for a short time
Would that you knew it during your life time
Did you think that We had created you for a playful purpose and that you were not to return to Us
God is the most exalted King and the Supreme Truth
He is the only God and the Lord of the Gracious Throne
One who worships things besides God has no proof of the authority of such things God is certainly keeping the record of his deeds
The unbelievers will not have everlasting happiness
Muhammad say Lord forgive me and grant me mercy You are the best of the Merciful Ones
This is a chapter which We have revealed to you and made obligatory for you to follow its guidance
We have revealed clear verses in it so that perhaps you may take heed
Flog the fornicatress and the fornicator with a hundred lashes each
Let there be no reluctance in enforcing the laws of God if you have faith in God and the Day of Judgment
Let it take place in the presence of a group of believers
No one should marry a fornicator except a fornicatress or a pagan woman
No one should marry a fornicatress except a fornicator or a pagan man
Such marriage is unlawful to the believers
Those who accuse married women of committing adultery but are not able to prove their accusation by producing four witness must be flogged eighty lashes
Never accept their testimony thereafter because they are sinful
except that of those who afterwards repent and reform themselves God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who accuse their spouses of committing adultery but have no witness except themselves should testify four times saying God is my witness that I am telling the truth
They should say on the fifth time Let God s curse be upon me if I am a liar
The spouse will be acquitted of the punishment if she challenges his testimony by saying four times God is my witness that he is a liar
On the fifth time she should say Let the curse of God be upon me if what he says is true
Had it not been for God s favors and mercy upon you your life would have been in chaos
God accepts repentance and He is Allwise
Those of you who have brought forward a false report against Aisha do not think that it will harm you
Rather it will be a benefit to you
Each one of you will face the result of his sin
The one among the group who was the chief instigator will face a great torment
Would that on your hearing this report the believing men and woman among you had a favorable attitude towards it and had said This report is clearly false
Would that they had brought four witness to testify to their report
Since they brought none they are liars before God
Were it not for the favors and mercy of God upon you in this world and in the life to come a great torment would strike you for your involvement in this false report
Your tongues moved and your mouths spoke of something of which you had no knowledge
You thought it to be a trivial matter while in the eyes of God it is blasphemy
Would that on hearing this report you had said We have nothing to say about it
God forbid
It is a serious accusation
God advises you never to do such things again if you have any faith
God explains to you His revelations
He is Allknowing and Allwise
Those who like to publicize indecency among the believers will face painful torment in this world and in the life to come
God knows what you do not know
Were it not for the favor and mercy of God upon you you would have faced painful punishment in this world and the life to come
God is Compassionate and Merciful
Believers do not follow the footsteps of satan whoever does so will be made by satan to commit indecency and sin
Were it not for the favor and mercy of God none of you would ever have been purified
God purifies whomever He wants
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
The welltodo and the rich among you should not fail to give to relatives the destitute and Emigrants for the cause of God
Be considerate and forgiving
Do you not want God to forgive you
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who slander the unaware but chaste and believing women of committing unlawful carnal relations are condemned in this life and in the life hereafter
They will suffer a great punishment
on the day when their tongues hands and feet will testify to what they had done
On that day God will give them due recompense and they will know that God is the Supreme Judge
Indecent woman are for indecent men and indecent men are for indecent woman
Decent women are for decent men and decent men are for decent women
The decent people are innocent of what people allege
They will receive mercy and honorable sustenance
Believers do not enter other s houses until you have asked permission and have greeted the people therein
This is best for you so that perhaps you may remember God s guidance
If you do not find anyone therein do not enter until you are given permission
If you are told to go away do so this is more decent of you
God knows all that you do
There is no harm for you to enter uninhabited houses where you have some goods
God knows whatever you reveal or hide
Muhammad tell the believing men to cast down their eyes and guard their carnal desires this will make them more pure
God is certainly aware of what they do
Tell the believing woman to cast down their eyes guard their chastity and not to show off their beauty except what is permitted by the law Let them cover their breasts with their veils
They must not show off their beauty to anyone other than their husbands father fatherinlaws sons stepsons brothers sons of brothers and sisters women of their kind their slaves immature male servants or immature boys They must not stamp their feet to show off their hidden ornaments
All of you believers turn to God in repentance so that perhaps you will have everlasting happiness
Marry the single people among you and the righteous slaves and slavegirls
If you are poor God will make you rich through His favor He is Bountiful and Allknowing
Let those who cannot find someone to marry maintain chastity until God makes them rich through His favors
Let the slaves who want to buy their freedom have an agreement with you in writing if you find them to be virtuous
Give them money out of God s property which He has given to you
Do not force your girls into prostitution to make money if they want to be chaste
If they have been compelled to do so God will be Allmerciful and Allforgiving to them
We have revealed to you illustrious revelations stories of the past generations and good advice for the pious people
God is the light of the heavens and the earth
A metaphor for His light is a niche in which there is a lamp placed in a glass
The glass is like a shining star which is lit from a blessed olive tree that is neither eastern nor western
Its oil almost lights up even though it has not been touched by the fire
It is light upon light
God guides to His light whomever He wants
God uses various metaphors
He has the knowledge of all things
This niche is in the houses that God has declared to be highly respected and His Name be mentioned therein in glory in the morning and evening
by people who can neither be diverted by merchandise nor bargaining from worshipping God saying their prayers and paying religious tax
They do these things for they are afraid of the day when all hearts and eyes will undergo terrible unrest and crisis
They worship Him so that God will reward their best deeds and give them more through His favors God gives sustenance to whomever He wants without account
The deeds of the unbelievers are like a mirage which a thirsty man thinks is water until he goes near and finds nothing
Instead he finds God who gives him his due recompense
God s reckoning is swift
Or it the deeds of the unbelievers are like the darkness of a deep stormy sea with layers of giant waves covered by dark clouds
It is darkness upon darkness whereby even if one stretches out his hands he can not see them
One can have no light unless God gives him light
Have you not considered that all that is between the heavens and the earth glorifies God and that the birds spread their wings in the air to glorify God
He knows everyone s prayers and praising God has absolute knowledge of what they do
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and to Him do all things return
Do you not see that God moves the clouds gently brings them together piles them up and then you can see the rain coming from them
He sends down hailstones from the mountains in the sky With them He strikes or protects from them whomever He wants
The lightening can almost take away the sight
God alternates the night and the day
In this there is a lesson for the people of understanding
God has created every living being from water Some of them creep on their bellies some walk on two feet and some of them walk on four legs
God creates whatever He wants
He has power over all things
We have revealed illustrious revelations
God guides to the right path whomever He wants
They say We have believed in God and the Messenger and we have obeyed them
Then a group of them turn away from their belief They are not believers
When they are called to God and His Messenger so that they will judge among them suddenly some of them turn away
If right was on their side they would come quickly
Are their hearts sick
Do they have doubts or are they afraid that God and His Messenger may do injustice to them
In fact they themselves are unjust
When the believers are called to God and His Messenger to be judged their only words are We have listened and obeyed
They will have everlasting happiness
Those who obey God and His Messenger who are humble before Him and who have fear of Him will certainly be successful
They strongly swear by God that they would march to fight for the cause of God if you were to order them to
Tell them You do not need to swear fighting for the cause of God is a virtuous deed and God is Well Aware of what you do
Say to them Obey God and His Messenger
If you turn away the Messenger and the people will each be responsible for their own obligations
If you follow the Messenger you will have the right guidance
The responsibility of the Messenger is only to preach
God has promised the righteously striving believers to appoint them as His deputies on earth as He had appointed those who lived before He will make the religion that He has chosen for them to stand supreme
He will replace their fear with peace and security so that they will worship God alone and consider no one equal to Him Whoever becomes an unbeliever after this will be a sinful person
Be steadfast in prayer pay the religious tax and obey the Messenger so that perhaps you will receive mercy
The unbelievers should not think that they can defeat God on earth
Their dwelling will be hell the most terrible abode
Believers your slaves and the immature people must ask your permission three times a day before entering your house before the morning prayer at noon time and after the late evening prayer these are most private times
After your permission has been granted there is no harm if they come into your presence from time to time
This is how God explains His revelations to you
God is Allknowing and Allwise
When your children become mature they must ask your permission before entering your house as the rest of the mature people do
Thus does God explain to you His revelations
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Elderly women who have no hope of getting married are allowed not to wear the kind of clothing that young woman must wear as long as they do not show off their beauty
It is better for them if they maintain chastity
God is Allhearing and Allknowing
It is no sin for the blind the lame the sick ones and yourselves to eat at your own homes or the homes of your father mothers brothers sisters your paternal and maternal uncles aunts or at the homes of your friend and the homes with which you are entrusted
It makes no difference whether you eat all together or one person at a time
When you enter a house say the blessed greeting which God has instructed you to say Thus does God explain to you His revelations so that perhaps you will understand
The true believers are those who have faith in God and His Messenger and when they are dealing with the Messenger in important matters they do not leave without his permission
Muhammad those who ask your permission believe in God and His Messenger
When they ask your leave to attend to their affairs you may give permission to anyone of them you choose and ask forgiveness for them from God
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Do not address the Messenger as you would call each other God knows those who secretly walk away from you and hide themselves Those who oppose the Messengers should beware lest some trouble or a painful torment should befall them
The heavens and the earth certainly belong to God
He surely knows all about you in this life
On the day when you return to Him He will tell you all about whatever you have done
God has the knowledge of all things
Blessed is He who has revealed the criteria for discerning truth from falsehood to His servant so that He could warn mankind
To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
He has not begotten any sons nor does He have any partner in His kingdom
He has created all things with precisely accurate planning
Yet they have chosen for themselves other deities besides Him who do not create anything but rather are themselves created who have no power over their own benefits or trouble and who have no control over life death and resurrection
The unbelievers say This Quran is no more than a slanderous statement which he Muhammad with the help of some other people has falsely invented Certainly this statement is unjust and sinful
They have also said It the Quran is only ancient legends which were written down while they were dictated to him in the mornings and the evenings
Muhammad tell them The One who knows all the secrets of the heavens and the earth has revealed it He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
They say Why does this Messenger eat food and walk in the streets
Why has not an angel been sent to him so that they could preach the message together
Why has a treasure not been laid out for him or a garden from which he could eat been given to him
The unjust ones say You are merely following a bewitched person
Look at their various views about you
They have gone astray and are not able to find the right path
Blessed is He who could give you palaces and gardens wherein streams would flow far better than what they want you to have
They deny the Hour of Doom so We have prepared for them a burning fire
Even if they were to see this fire from a distant place they would only listen to its raging and roaring
When they are thrown bound into a narrow place therein then only will they wish for their death
They will be told Do not pray to die only once but pray to die many times
Muhammad ask them Is what you want better or the eternal garden promised to the pious ones as their reward and dwelling
Therein they will eternally have whatever they want
This is a binding promise from your Lord
On the day when the unbelievers and whatever they had been worshipping besides God will be resurrected He will ask the idols Did you mislead My servants or did they themselves go astray from the right path
They will reply Lord You alone deserve all glory
We were not supposed to choose any guardian other than you
Since you have been benevolent to these people and their fathers they forgot Your guidance and thus became subject to perdition
God will say to the idolaters Your idols have rejected your faith
You cannot avoid their rejection nor can you find any help
Anyone of you who commits injustice will be made to suffer a great torment
All the Messengerss whom We sent before certainly ate food and walked through the streets
We have made some of you people a trial for the others
Would you then exercise patience
Your Lord is Allaware
Those who have no desire to meet Us have said Would that the angels had been sent to us or that we could see our Lord
They are really filled with pride and have committed the greatest and worst kind of rebellion and hostility
On the day when the criminals see the angels there will certainly be no rejoicing for them
Rather they will plead to the angels Please keep away from us do not drive us into hell
We shall call their deeds into Our presence and scatter them into the air as dust turn them devoid of all virtue
The dwellers of Paradise on that day will have the best residence and resting place
On that day the sky will be crystal blue clear of clouds The angels will descend in groups
and the Absolute kingdom will belong to the Beneficent God
It will be a hard day for the unbelievers It will be a day when the unjust will bite their fingers regretfully saying Would that we had followed the path of the Messengers
Woe to us
Would that we had not been friends with so and so
He led me away from the true guidance after it had come to us
Satan is a traitor to people
The Messengers will say Lord my people had abandoned this Quran
Thus from the sinful people We made enemies for every Prophet
Your Lord is a Sufficient Guide and Helper
The unbelievers have said Why was the whole Quran not revealed to him at once
We have revealed it to you in gradual steps to strengthen your hearts and give you explanations
We will support you with the Truth and the best interpretation whenever the infidels argue against you
Those who will be driven headlong into hell will have a terrible dwelling they have certainly gone astray
We gave the Book to Moses and made his brother Aaron his Minister
We told them Both of you go to the people who have rejected Our revelations
We completely destroyed these unbelievers
We drowned the people of Noah because of their rejection of the Messengers and made them evidence of the Truth for mankind
We have prepared a painful torment for the unjust ones
To each of the tribes of Ad Thamud the settlers around the well and many generations in between
We gave guidance and drove each to destruction
Our Messengers came into the town which was struck by a fatal rain
Did they unbelievers not see what had happened to this town
In fact they had no faith in the Resurrection
Muhammad when they see you they will only mock you and say Has God really sent him as a Messengers
Had we not been steadfast he would almost have led us astray from our gods
On facing torment they will soon know who had really gone astray
How can you be the guardian of those who have chosen their own desires as their Lord
Do you think that most of them listen and understand
They are like cattle or even more straying and confused
Have you not seen that your Lord increases the shadow
Had He wanted He would have made it stationary and has made the sun their guide
Then He reduces it in gradual steps
It is He who has made the night as a covering for you sleep as a rest for you and the day for you to rise again
It is He who sends the winds to you with the glad news of His mercy and who sends purifying rain from the sky
to revive the barren land and provide water for many creatures cattle and people
We send them rain from time to time so that they may take heed
Many people have responded but ungratefully
Had We wanted We could have sent a Prophet to every town
Do not yield to the unbelievers but launch a great campaign against them with the help of the Quran
It is He who has joined the two seas one palatable and sweet the other bitterly salty and has established a barrier between them as a partition
It is He who has created the human being from water to have relationships of both lineage and wedlock
Your Lord has all power
They worship besides God things that can neither benefit nor harm them
The unbelievers are defiant against their Lord
We have sent you for no other reason but to be a bearer of glad news and warning
Tell them I ask no recompense for my preaching to you except the fact that whoever wants should choose the way of God
Also trust in the Living One who never dies and glorify Him with His praise
He has sufficient knowledge of the sins of His servants
It is He who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days and then He established His domination over the Throne
He is the Beneficent God Refer to Him as the final authority
When they are told to prostrate themselves before the Beneficent God they say Who is the Beneficent God
Why should we prostrate ourselves before the one whom you have commanded us to
This only increases their rebelliousness
Blessed is He who has established constellations in the sky and made therein a lamp and a shining moon
It is He who has made the night and the day one proceeding the other for whoever wants to take heed or give thanks
Among the servants of the Beneficent God are those who walk gently on the earth and when addressed by the ignorant ones their only response is Peace be with you
They are those who spend the night worshipping their Lord prostrating and standing
who pray Lord protect us from the torment of hell it is a great loss
It is a terrible abode and an evil station
who in their spending are neither extravagant nor stingy but maintain moderation
who do not worship idols besides God nor without a just cause murder a soul to whom God has granted amnesty who do not commit fornication for those who do so have committed a sin
and on the Day of Judgment their torment will be double They will suffer forever in disgrace
But only those who repent and believe and act righteously will have their sins replaced by virtue God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Those who repent and act righteously have truly returned to God
those who do not testify falsely and when they come across something impious pass it by nobly
who when reminded of the revelations of their Lord do not try to ignore them as though deaf and blind Rather they try to understand and think about them
They pray Lord let our spouses and children be the delight of our eyes and ourselves examples for the pious ones
They will all receive Paradise as their reward for their forbearance and patience where they will be greeted with Peace be with you
They will live therein forever the best abode and place of rest
Muhammad say to the disbeliever It does not matter to my Lord whether you worship Him or not
You have rejected His guidance and your punishment is inevitable
Sin Mim
These are the verses of the illustrious Book
You will perhaps kill yourself with anguish because they are not accepting the faith
Had We wanted We would have sent them a miracle from the sky to make their heads hang down in submission
Whenever a new message comes to them from the Beneficent God they turn away from it
They have called our revelation lies
They will soon learn the consequences of what they mocked
Have they not seen the earth in which We have made gracious plants grow
In this there is certainly evidence of the Truth
But most of them have no faith
Your Lord is the Majestic and the Allmerciful
When Your Lord told Moses to go to the unjust people of the Pharaoh
and ask them Why do you not fear God
He replied Lord I am afraid that they will call me a liar
I feel nervous and my tongue is not fluent so send Aaron with me
They have charged me with a crime for which I am afraid they will kill me
The Lord said Have no fear both of you go with Our miracles
We shall closely listen to you
They came to the Pharaoh and said We are the Messengerss of the Lord of the Universe
Send the Israelites with us
The Pharaoh said Did we not bring you up in our home as an infant and did you not live with us for many years
and you did the deed which you did
You are certainly ungrateful
Moses said I did do it and I made a mistake
Then I ran away from you in fear but my Lord granted me the law and has appointed me as a Messenger
And this is the favor with which you oblige me You have made the Israelites your slaves
The Pharaoh asked Who is the Lord of the Universe
Moses replied The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if you want to be certain
The Pharaoh said to the people around him Did you hear that
Moses continued He is the Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
The Pharaoh said The Messengers who has been sent to you is certainly insane
Moses continued He is the Lord of the East and West and all that is between them if only you would think
Pharaoh said If you put forward any god other than me I will surely put you in prison
Moses asked What if I were to bring you clear proof of the existence of God
The Pharaoh replied Bring it if you are telling the truth
Moses threw his staff and suddenly it became a serpent
Then he uncovered his hand and it was sheer white to the onlookers
The Pharaoh said to the people around him He is certainly a skillful magician
He wants to expel you from your land through his magic
What is your opinion
They said Hold him and his brother off for a while
and summon every skillful magician from all the cities
So all the magicians gathered together
at the appointed time
and the people were asked Will you all be there so that we may follow the magicians if they become victorious
When the magicians came they asked the Pharaoh Will there be any reward for us if we win
He replied You will then be my closest associates
Moses asked the magicians Cast down what you want to
So they cast down their ropes and staffs saying By the honor of the Pharaoh we shall certainly become the winners
Then Moses cast down his staff and suddenly it swallowed up what they had falsely invented
The magicians fell down in adoration
saying We believe in the Lord of the Universe
and the Lord of Moses and Aaron
The Pharaoh said You believed without my permission
He seems to be your chief who has taught you magic
But you will soon know the result of what you have done
I shall certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and crucify you all together
They said It does not matter We shall be returning to our Lord
We hope that our Lord will forgive us for our sins we were not believers at first
We sent a revelation to Moses telling him to leave with our servants during the night they would be pursued by the Pharaoh
The Pharaoh sent word to all the cities saying
There is a small group of people
who have enraged us greatly
We are warning all of you about them
We deprived them the unbelievers of gardens springs
treasures and graceful dwellings
Thus we let the Israelites inherit them all
The people of the Pharaoh pursued them at sunrise
When the two groups came close to each other the companions of Moses said We will be caught
Moses said Certainly not
My Lord is with me and He will certainly guide me
We sent a revelation to Moses saying Strike the sea with your staff The sea was rent asunder and each side stood high up like a huge mountain
Then We brought the two parties closer
We saved Moses and all the people with him
and drowned the other party
In this there was certainly evidence of the Truth but most of them did not have any faith
Your Lord is certainly Majestic and Allmerciful
Tell them the story of Abraham
when he asked his father and others What do you worship
They replied We worship idols and shall continue to worship them
He asked them Can the idols hear you when you pray to them
or can they benefit or harm you
They said No but our fathers worshipped them
Abraham said Do you know that what you worship and what your grandfathers worshipped
are my enemies Not so the Lord of the Universe
He created me and He will guide me
It is He who gives me food and drink
and heals me when I am sick
He will cause me to die and will bring me back to life
It is He whom I expect to forgive my sins on the Day of Judgment
Lord grant me authority Join me to the righteous ones
Make my words come true in the future
Make me inherit the bountiful Paradise
Forgive my father
He has gone astray
Do not betray me
on the Day of Judgment when neither wealth nor children will be of any benefit
except what is done in obedience to God with a submissive heart
On the Day of Judgment Paradise will be brought near
the pious and hell will be left open for the rebellious ones
who will be asked What did you worship
besides God
Will the idols help you
Can they help themselves
The idol worshippers the idols the rebellious ones
and the army of satan will all be thrown headlong into hell
Quarrelling therein with each other
they will say By God we were in clear error
when we considered you equal to the Lord of the Universe
Only the sinful ones made us go astray
We have no one to intercede for us before God
nor a loving friend
Would that we could have a chance to live again so that we might become believers
In this there is evidence of the truth but many of them do not have any faith
Your Lord is certainly Majestic and Allmerciful
The people of Noah rejected the Messengerss
span class col Their brother Noah asked them Why do you not fear God
I am a trustworthy Messengers sent to you
Have fear of God and obey me
I ask no payment from you for my preaching
The Lord of the Universe will give me my reward
Have fear of God and obey me
They said Should we believe in you when no one has followed you except the lowest ones
Noah said I have no knowledge of their deeds
If only you would realize their account is with my Lord
I do not drive away the believers
I am only a Prophet
They said Noah if you do not desist you will certainly be stoned to death
Then Noah said Lord my people have rejected me
Judge among us and save me and the believers with me
We saved him and those who were with him in a fully laden Ark
and drowned the others
In this there is evidence of the truth but most of them do not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
The tribe of Ad rejected the Messengers
Their brother Hud asked them Why do you not have fear of God
I am a trustworthy Messengers sent to you
Have fear of God and obey me
I do not ask for any payment for my preaching
I shall receive my reward from the Lord of the Universe
Do you build useless monuments on every mountain
and raise strong mansions as if you were to live forever
When you attack you attack as tyrants do
Have fear of God and obey me
Have fear of the One who has bestowed upon you all that you know
He has given you cattle children
gardens and springs
I am afraid that you will suffer the torment of the Day of Judgment
They said Whether you preach to us or not
your preaching is nothing but ancient legends and we shall not face any torment
They rejected him and We destroyed them
In this there is evidence of the Truth yet most of them do not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
The tribe of Thamud rejected the Messengers
Their brother Salih asked them Why do you not fear God
I am a trustworthy Messengers sent to you
Have fear of God and obey me
I do not ask for any payment for my preaching
I shall receive my reward from the Lord of the Universe
Do you think that you will remain here peacefully forever
amidst the gardens springs
farms and palmtrees in thick groves
carving comfortable houses out of the mountains
Have fear of God and obey me
Do not obey the orders of the transgressors
who spread evil in the land with no reform
They said You are only bewitched and insane
You are a mere mortal like us
Show us a miracle if you are telling the Truth
He said This is a shecamel
She will have her share of water as you have your share each on a certain day
Do not cause her to suffer lest you become subject to the torment of the great day of Judgment
They slew the shecamel but later became regretful
and torment struck them
In this there is evidence of the Truth yet many people do not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
The people of Lot rejected the Messengers
Their brother Lot asked them Why do you not have fear of God
I am a trustworthy Messengers
Have fear of God and obey me
I do not ask any payment for my preaching
I shall receive my reward from the Lord of the Universe
Do you in the world want to have carnal relations with males
instead of your wives whom your Lord has created specially for you
You are a transgressing people
They said Lot if you do not give up preaching you will certainly be expelled from this town
He said I certainly hate what you practice
Lord save me and my family from their deeds
We saved him and all of his family
except an old woman who remained behind
We destroyed the others
by pouring upon them a terrible shower of rain
How evil was the rain for those who had been warned
In this there is an evidence of the Truth but many of them did not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
The dwellers of the forest also rejected the Messengers
Shu ayb asked them Why do you not have fear of God
I am a trustworthy Messengers
Have fear of God and obey me
I do not ask any payment for my preaching
I shall receive my reward from the Lord of the Universe
Maintain just measure in your business and do not cause loss to others
Weigh your goods with proper balance
and do not defraud people in their property or spread evil in the land
Have fear of the One who has created you and the generations that lived before you
They said You are no more than a bewitched and insane man
and a mere mortal like us
We think you are a liar
Let a part of the sky fall on us if what you say is true
He said My Lord knows all that you do
They rejected him and then the torment of the gloomy day struck them
It was certainly a great torment
In this there is an evidence of the Truth but many of them did not have any faith
Your Lord is Majestic and Allmerciful
This Quran is certainly the revelation from the Lord of the Universe
It has been revealed through the trustworthy Spirit
to your heart so that you will warn the people of the dangers of disobeying God
It has been revealed in plain Arabic
Its news was also mentioned in the ancient Books
Is not the fact that the Israelite scholars already knew about the Quran through their Book sufficient evidence for the pagans of the truthfulness of the Quran
Had We revealed it to a nonArab
who would have read it to them they pagans would not have believed in it
Thus it passes through the hearts of the criminals
They will not believe in it until they suffer the painful torment
The torment will strike them suddenly without their knowledge
They will say Can we be granted any respite
Do they want to hasten Our torment
Do you not see that even if We give them respite for years
and then Our torment will strike them
none of their luxuries will be able to save them from the torment
We never destroyed any town without first sending to them warning and guidance
We have never been unjust to anyone
The satans have not revealed the Quran
they are not supposed to do so
Nor do have they the ability for such a task
The satans are barred from listening to anything from the heavens
Muhammad do not worship anything besides God lest you suffer the punishment
Warn your close relatives
and be kind to your believing followers
If they disobey you tell them I condemn your disobedient deeds
Have trust in the Majestic and Allmerciful God
who can see whether you stand up
or move during your prostration with the worshippers
He is Allhearing and Allknowing
Should I tell you to whom the satans come
They come to every sinful liar
The satans try to listen to the heavens but many of them are liars
Only the erring people follow the poets
Have you not seen them wandering and bewildered in every valley
and preaching what they themselves never practice
The righteously striving believers among them who remember God very often and use their talent to seek help after they have been wronged are the exceptional The unjust will soon know how terrible their end will be
Ta Sin
These are the verses of the Quran and of the illustrious Book
They are glad news and guidance for the believers
who are steadfast in prayer who pay the religious tax and who have strong faith in the life hereafter
We have made the deeds of those who do not believe in the life to come attractive to them and they wander about blindly
They will suffer the worst kind of torment and will be lost in the life to come
Muhammad you have certainly received the Quran from the Allwise and Allknowing One
Moses said to his family I have seen some fire I shall bring you some news about it or some fire so that you can warmyourselves
When he approached the fire he was told Blessed is the one in the fire and those around it
All glory belongs to God the Lord of the Universe
Moses I am God the Majestic and Allwise
Throw down your staff
When Moses saw his staff on the ground moving like a living creature he stepped back and did not come forward again
The Lord said Moses do not be afraid
Messengers do not become afraid in My presence
Only the unjust become afraid in My presence
Even to these people who replace their bad deeds by good ones I am Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Put your hand into your pocket It will come out sheer white but unharmed
This is one of the nine miracles which shall be showing to the Pharaoh and his people they are truly wicked men
When Our miracles were visibly shown to them they said It is plain magic
They rejected the evidence because of their arrogance and injustice although their souls knew it to be true
Think how terrible the end of the sinful ones was
We gave knowledge to David and Soloman They said It is only God who deserves all praise
He has exalted us above many of His believing servants
Solomon became the heir to David He said People we have been taught the language of the birds and have been granted a share of everything
This indeed is a manifest favor from God
Soloman s army consisting of human beings jinn and birds were gathered together in his presence in ranks
When they arrived in the valley of the ants one ant said to the others Enter your dwellings lest you be carelessly crushed by Soloman and his army
Solomon smiled at the ant s remarks and said Lord inspire me to thank you for Your favors to me and my parents and to act righteously so as to please you
Admit me by your mercy into the company of Your righteous servants
Solomon inspected the birds and said How is it that I cannot see the hoopoe
Is he absent
I shall certainly punish him severely or slaughter him unless he has a good reason for his absence
Not long after the hoopoe came forward and said I have information which you do not have
I have come from the land of Sheba with a true report
I found a woman ruling the people there and she possessed something of almost everything and a great throne
I found her and her people prostrating before the sun instead of God
Satan has made their deeds attractive to them He has kept them away from the right path and they have no guidance
Satan has done this so that they will not worship God who brings forth whatever is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows whatever you conceal or reveal
God is the only Lord and master of the Great Throne
Solomon said We shall see whether you are truthful or a liar
Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them then return and see what their reply will be
The Queen of Sheba said to her officials A gracious letter has been dropped before me
It reads From Soloman In the Name of God the Beneficent and the Merciful
Do not consider yourselves superior to me but come to me as Muslims in submission
She said My officials what are your views on this matter
I will not decide until I have your views
They replied We have great power and valor You are the commander so decide as you like
She said When Kings enter a town they destroy it and disrespect its honorable people
That is what they will do too
I will send a gift and we shall see what response the Messengers will bring
When her Messengers came to Soloman he said Have you brought me wealth
What God has given to me is far better than what He has given to you but you are happy with your gifts
Go back to your people and we shall soon come there with an army which they will not be able to face We shall drive them from their town humble and disgraced
Solomon asked his people Who among you can bring her throne before she the queen of Sheba comes to me submissively
A monstrous jinn said I can bring it before you even stand up
I am powerful and trustworthy
The one who had knowledge from the Book said I can bring it to you before you even blink your eye
When Solomon saw the throne placed before him he said This is a favor from my Lord by which He wants to test whether I am grateful or ungrateful
Whoever thanks God does so for his own good
Whoever is ungrateful to God should know that my Lord is SelfSufficient and Benevolent
Then he said Make a few changes to her throne and let us see whether she will recognize it or not
When she came she was asked Is your throne like this
She replied It seems that this is it
We had received the knowledge before this and were submissive to Solomon s power
Her idols prevented her from believing in God and she was an infidel
She was told to enter the palace
When she saw it she thought that it was a pool and raised her clothe up to her legs
Solomon said This is a palace constructed with glass
She said My Lord indeed I have wronged myself and I submit myself with Solomon to the will of God the Lord of the Universe
We sent to the tribe of Thamud their brother Salih so that they would worship God but they became two quarrelling groups
Salih said My people why do you commit sins so quickly before doing good
Would that you ask forgiveness from God so that perhaps He will have mercy upon you
They said We have an ill omen about you and your followers
Salih replied God has made your ill fortune await you
You are a people on trial
There were nine tribes in the city spreading evil without any reform in the land
They said Let us swear by God to do away with him and his family during the night then tell his guardian that we did not see how he and his family had been destroyed and we shall be telling the truth
They plotted and We planned without their knowledge Consider the result of their plot
We destroyed them and their people altogether
Those are their empty houses which We ruined because of their injustice
In this there is evidence of the truth for the people of knowledge
We saved the faithful Godfearing believers
Lot asked his people Do you understandably commit indecency
Do you have carnal relations with men rather than women
You are ignorant people
His people had no answer but to say Expel Lot and his family from the town for they want to be pure
We saved Lot and his family except his wife who was destined to remain behind
We sent to them a terrible rainstorm
How horrible was the rain for the people who had already received warning
Muhammad say It is only God who deserves all praise
Peace be upon His chosen servants
Which is better God or the idols
Are the idols worthier or the One who has created the heavens and the earth who has sent water from the sky for you who has established delightful gardens and you could not even plant one tree
Is there any Lord besides God
In fact the unbelievers are the ones who deviate from the right path
Are the idols worthier or the One who has made the earth a resting place the rivers flow from its valleys the mountains as anchors and a barrier between the two seas
Is there any lord besides God
In fact most people do not know
Are the idols worthier or the One who answers the prayers of the distressed ones removes their hardship and makes you the successors in the land
Is there any lord besides God
In fact you take very little heed
Are the idols worthier or the One who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea and sends the winds bearing the glad news of His mercy
Is there any lord besides God
God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else
Are the idols worthier or the One who began the creation and who will turn it back who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth
Is there any lord besides God
Say Bring your proof if what you say is true
Muhammad say No one in the heavens or the earth knows the unseen except God and no one knows when they will be resurrected
Their knowledge of the next life is no more than doubts In fact they are blind about it
The unbelievers have said Shall we and our fathers be brought out of the graves after we become dust
It was promised to us and to our fathers before us
It is only ancient legends
Say Travel through the land and see how terrible was the end of the criminal ones
Muhammad do not be grieved about their disbelief nor distressed about their evil plans against you
They ask When the Day of Judgment will come if it is true at all
Say Perhaps some of the things which you wish to experience immediately are very close to you
Your Lord has many favors for mankind but most of them are ungrateful
Your Lord certainly knows whatever their hearts conceal or reveal
All the secrets in heavens and earth are recorded in the illustrious Book
This Quran tells the Israelites most of the matters about which they had disputes among themselves
It is a guide and mercy for the believers
Your Lord will judge among them according to His own decree
He is Majestic and AllKnowing
Trust in God for you follow the manifest truth
You cannot make the dead listen and the deaf are unable to hear calls Thus they turn back on their heels
You cannot guide the straying blind ones
You can only make hear those who believe in Our revelations submissively
When the word about them comes true We shall make a creature appear to them on earth who will tell them that people had no faith in Our revelations
On the day when We resurrect from every nation a group from among those who had rejected Our revelations they will be kept confined in ranks
When they will be brought into the presence of God He will ask them Did you reject My revelations without fully understanding them
What did you know about them if you had any knowledge at all
They will become subject to punishment because of their injustice
Thus they will not speak
Have they not seen that We have created the night for them to rest and the day for them to see
In this there is evidence for the believing people
Everyone in the heavens and earth will be terrified on the day when the trumpet will be sounded except those whom God will save Everyone will humbly come into the presence of God
You think the mountains are solid In fact they move like clouds
It is God s technique which has established everything perfectly
He is well Aware of what you do
Whoever does a good deed will receive a better reward than what he has done
He will be secure from the terror of the Day of Judgment
Those who commit evil will be thrown headlong into hell fire
It will be said to them can you expect any recompense other than what you deserve for your deeds
I am commanded to worship the Lord of this town which He has made sacred To Him belong all things I am commanded to be a Muslim
and recite the Quran
Whoever seeks guidance will find it for his own soul
Say to whoever goes astray I am only a warner
Say It is only He who deserves all praise
He will soon show you His signs and you will recognize them
Your Lord is not unaware of what you do
Sin Mim
These are the verses of the illustrious Book
We recite to you some of the story of Moses and the Pharaoh for a genuine purpose and for the benefit of the believing people
The Pharaoh dominated the land and divided its inhabitants into different groups suppressing one group by killing their sons and keeping their women alive
He was certainly an evildoer
But We have decided to grant a favor to the suppressed ones by appointing them leaders and heirs of the land
give them power in the land and make the Pharaoh Haman his Minister and their armies to experience from their victims what they feared most
We inspired Moses mother saying Breastfeed your son
When you become afraid for his life throw him into the sea
Do not be afraid or grieved for We shall return him to you and make him a Messenger
The people of the Pharaoh picked him up without realizing that he would become their enemy and a source of their sorrow The Pharaoh Haman and their army were sinful people
The Pharaoh s wife said He Moses is the delight of our eyes
Do not kill him
Perhaps he will benefit us or we may adopt him
They were unaware of the future
The heart of Moses mother was relieved and confident
But she would almost have made the whole matter public had We not strengthened her heart with faith
She told Moses sister to follow her brother
His sister watched him from one side and the people of the Pharaoh did not notice her presence
We had decreed that the infant must not be breastfed by any nurse besides his mother
His sister said to the people of the Pharaoh May I show you a family who can nurse him for you with kindness
Thus did We return Moses to his mother that We would delight her eyes relieve her sorrows and let her know that the promise of God was true but many people do not know
When he become matured and grow to manhood We granted him wisdom and knowledge
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
He entered the city without the knowledge of its inhabitants and found two men fighting each other
One was his follower and the other his enemy
His follower asked him for help
Moses struck his enemy to death but later said It was the work of satan he is the sworn enemy of the human being and wants to mislead him
Moses said Lord I have wronged myself
Forgive me
The Lord forgave him He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
He said Lord in appreciation for Your favor to me I shall never support the criminals
He remained in the city but very afraid and cautious
Suddenly the person who asked him for help the previous day asked him for help again
Moses said You are certainly a mischievous person
When Moses was about to attack their enemy he said Moses do you want to kill me as you slew a soul the other day
Do you want to become a tyrant in the land not a reformer
A man came running from the farthest part of the city saying Moses people are planning to kill you I sincerely advise you to leave the city
So he left the city afraid and cautious saying Lord protect me against the unjust people
When he started his journey to Midian he said Perhaps my Lord will show me the right path
When he arrived at the well of Midian he found some people watering their sheep and two women keeping the sheep away from the others
He asked the two women What is the matter with you
They replied We cannot water our sheep until all the shepherds have driven away their flocks Our father is an old man
Moses watered their flocks and then sought shelter under a shadow praying Lord I need the means to preserve the power that You have granted me
One of the women walking bashfully came to Moses and said My father calls you and wants to pay you for your watering our flocks
When Moses came to the woman s father and told him his whole story he said Do not be afraid
Now you are secure from the unjust people
One of the women said to her father Father hire him the best whom you may hire is a strong and trustworthy one
He Shu ayb said to Moses I want to give one of my daughters to you in marriage on the condition that you will work for me for eight years but you may continue for two more years only out of your own accord
I do not want it to become a burden for you
God willing you will find me a righteous person
Moses said Let it be a binding contract between us and I shall be free to serve for any of the said terms God will bear witness to our agreement
When Moses completed the term of the contract and departed from his employer with his family he saw a fire on his way on one side of the Mount Sinai
He asked his wife Stay here
I can see some fire
Perhaps I will be able to bring some news of it or some fire for you to warmup yourselves
He was called from a tree of the blessed spot of the bank of the right side of the valley when he appraoched it Moses I am God the Lord of the Universe
Throw down your staff
When Moses saw his staff moving on the ground like a living being he fled with no desire to step forward
He was told Moses step forward
Do not be afraid you will be safe and secure
Place your hand in your pocket it will come out sheer white but not sick Be humble for fear of God and show these two miracles of your Lord to the Pharaoh and his officials they are an evildoing people
Moses said Lord I have killed a man from their people and I am afraid that they will kill me
My brother Aaron is more fluent then I am
Send him with me to assist me and express my truthfulness I am afraid they will reject me
The Lord said We will support you by your brother and will grant you such prestige that no one will dare to approach anyone of you
By the help of Our miracles both you and your follower will certainly triumph
When Moses came to them with Our miracles they said These are only invented magic
We have never heard of such things from our fathers
Moses said My Lord knows best who has received guidance from Him and who will achieve a happy end
The unjust ones certainly will have no happiness
The Pharaoh said My people I know no one who could be your lord besides myself Haman construct for me a tower of baked bricks so that I may climb on it and see the God of Moses I think he is a liar
The Pharaoh and his army were puffedup with pride in the land for no true cause They thought that they would never return to Us
We sized him and his army and threw them into the sea
See how terrible was the end of the unjust people
We made them the kinds of leaders who would invite people to the fire and who would receive no help on the Day of Judgment
We made them to be mentioned with condemnation in this life and they will be disgraced on the Day of Judgment
After destroying the people of the ancient towns We gave the Book to Moses to be a source of knowledge a guidance and mercy for mankind so that perhaps they would take heed
Muhammad you were not present at the west bank to witness when We gave the commandments to Moses
But We raised many generations after Moses and they lived for many years You did not dwell with the people of Midian reciting Our revelations to them but We had certainly sent Messengers to them
You had not been present at the side of the Mount Sinai when We called Moses from the tree but through Our mercy we told you his story so that you might warn the people
to whom no warner had been sent that perhaps they might take heed and that on experiencing afflictions because of their own deeds they may not say Lord would that You had sent to us a Messenger so that we could follow Your revelations and become believers
When the Truth from Us came to them they said Would that he Muhammad had received what was given to Moses by his Lord
Did not they reject what Moses had brought to them saying These two Moses and Aaron are two magicians who support each other We do not have any faith in them
Muhammad tell them Bring a Book if you are able to from God better in its guidance than the Torah and the Quran I shall follow it
If they cannot meet such a challenge know that they are only following their evil desires
Who strays more than one who follows his desires without guidance from God
God does not guide the unjust people
We sent Our guidance to them so that perhaps they might take heed
Some of the followers of the Bible believe in the Quran
When it is recited to them they say We believe in it
It is the Truth from our Lord
We were Muslims before it was revealed
These will receive double reward for their forbearance replacing evil by virtue and for their spending for the cause of God
When they hear impious words they ignore them saying We shall be responsible for our deeds and you will be responsible for yours
Peace be with you
We do not want to become ignorant
Muhammad you cannot guide whomever you love but God guides whomever He wants and knows best those who seek guidance
They the pagans say If we were to follow your guidance we would be snatched away from our land
Have We not given them the secure holy precinct wherein all types of fruits are brought to them as a sustenance from Us
However many of them do not know it
How many nations who had enjoyed great prosperity had We destroyed
Those are their homes which were not inhabited thereafter except for a short time
Only We were their heirs
Your Lord did not destroy the people of the towns without first sending a Messenger to the mother town who would recite His revelations to them
We did not want to destroy the towns if the people therein were not unjust
Whatever you people have been given are only the means for enjoyment and beauty of the worldly life but the means of enjoyment which you will receive from God in the life to come will be better and everlasting
Will you then not take heed
Is the case of those to whom We have promised good things which they will certainly receive in the life to come equal to the case of those to whom We have granted the means of enjoyment in the worldly life and who will certainly be questioned about them in the life to come
On the day when He will ask the latter group Where are those whom you had considered equal to Me
Those who have become subject to punishment will say Lord they seduced us Their idols will say We seduced them but we renounce their worshipping us for it was not us whom they worshipped
They will be told to call their idols
They will call them but will receive no answer
They will see the torment approaching and wish that they had sought guidance
On the day when God will call them and ask them What answer did you give to Our messengers
The door to all answers will be closed to them and they will not even be able to ask one another
However those who have repented and have become righteously striving believers will perhaps have everlasting happiness
Your Lord creates and chooses to grant mercy to whomever He wants
In matters of guidance they unbelievers do not have the choice to choose whatever they want
God is too exalted to be considered equal to anything else
Your Lord knows all that their hearts hide or reveal
He is the only God and it is only He who deserves to be given thanks in this world and in the life to come Judgment is in His hands and to Him you will all return
Muhammad ask them Think if God were to cause the night to continue until the Day of Judgment which Lord besides Him could bring you light
Will you then not listen to His revelations
Say Do you not think that if God were to cause the day to continue until the Day of Judgment which Lord besides Him could bring you the night to rest Do you not see His signs
He has made the night and day for you to rest as a mercy to you and seek His favor and that perhaps you will give Him thanks
God will call the unbelievers on the Day of Judgment and ask them Where are your idols in which you had faith
We shall call from every nation a witness and shall ask them to bring proof in support of their belief
They will know that truth belongs to God and that whatever they had falsely invented has abandoned them
Korah was a man from the people of Moses
This man rebelled against them We had given him so much treasure that the keys of the stores of his treasures could hardly even be carried by a group of strong people
His people told him Do not be proud of your wealth God does not love those who are proudly happy of their wealth
Seek the gains of the life to come through your wealth without ignoring your share of this life Do favors to others just as God has done favors to you Do not commit evil in the land for God does not love the evildoers
He said I have received this wealth because of my knowledge
Did he not know that God had destroyed many generations that lived before him who were stronger than him in power and people
There will be no need to ask the criminals what sins they have committed for the angels already know them
Korah would bedeck himself to show off his wealth Those who wanted worldly gains would say Would that we were given that which Korah has received
He has certainly received a great share
The people who had received knowledge would tell them Woe to you
The reward of God is far better for the righteously striving believers
No one can receive such reward except those who exercise patience
We caused the earth to swallow up him and his home No one besides God could help him nor could he himself achieve victory
The people who the other day had wished to be like him began saying Woe to us
God gives abundant wealth only to those of His servants whom He wants and He determines everyone s share
Had it not been for God s favor to us He would have caused the earth to swallow us up
Woe to the unbelievers who will have no happiness
There is the life hereafter which We have prepared for those who do not want to impose their superiority over the others in the land nor commit evil therein
The happy end certainly belongs to the pious ones
The reward for a good deed will be greater than the deed itself and the recompense for an evil deed will be equivalent to the deed
Muhammad God Who has commanded you to follow the guidance of the Quran will certainly return you victoriously to your place of birth
Say My Lord knows best who has brought guidance and who is in plain error
You had no hope of receiving the Book except by the mercy of your Lord Do not be a supporter of the unbelievers
Let them not prevent you from following the revelations of God after they are revealed to you
Call mankind to your Lord and do not be a pagan
Do not worship anything besides God
He is the only God
Everything will be destroyed except God
To Him belongs Judgment and to Him you will all return
Alif Lam
Do people think they will not be tested because they say We have faith
We had certainly tried those who lived before them to make sure who were truthful in their faith and who were liars
Do the evildoers think they can escape Us
How terrible is their judgment
Let those who have the desire to be in the presence of God on the Day of Judgment know that their day will certainly be coming
God is AllHearing and AllKnowing
Whoever strives hard should know that it is for his own good
God is independent of the whole world
We shall expiate the sins of the righteously striving believers and shall reward them better than their deeds
We have advised the human being Be kind to your parents
Do not obey them if they force you to consider equal to Me things which you do not know are such
You will all return to Me and I shall show all that you have done
We shall admit the righteously striving believers into the company of the pious ones
Some people say We have faith in God But when they face some hardship for His cause they begin to consider the persecution that they have experienced from people as a torment from God
When your Lord grants you a victory they say We were with you
Does God not know best what is in the hearts of every creature
God certainly knows all about the believers and the hypocrites
The unbelievers say to the believers Follow our way
We shall take the responsibility for your sins
They cannot take responsibility for any of the sins
They are only liars
Besides the other burdens that they will have to carry they will certainly be loaded with the burden of their own sins
They will be questioned on the Day of Judgment about what they had falsely invented
We sent Noah to his people and he lived with them for nine hundred and fifty years then the flood engulfed them for their injustice
We saved Noah and the people in the Ark and made their case a miracle for the world
Abraham told his people Worship God and have fear of Him
It is better for you if only you knew it
You worship idols besides God and you create falsehood
Whatever you worship besides Him cannot provide you with anything for your sustenance
Seek your sustenance from the bounties of God
Worship Him Give Him thanks
To Him you will all return
If you pagans call our revelations lies certainly many generations living before you have also done the same thing
The duty of a Messenger is only to preach clearly
Have they not seen how God begins the creation and then turns it back This is not difficult at all for God
Muhammad say to them Travel through the land and see how He has begun the creation and how He will invent the next life God has power over all things
He punishes or grants mercy to whomever He wants and to Him you will all return
You cannot challenge God in the heavens or in the earth
No one besides God is your guardian or helper
Those who have rejected God s revelations have no hope in receiving His mercy
They will face a painful torment
Abraham s people had no answer except suggesting Kill him or burn him
But God saved him from the fire
In this there is evidence of truth for the believing people
Abraham said You believe in idols besides God only out of worldly love but on the Day of Judgment you will reject and condemn each other
Your dwelling will be fire and no one will help you
Only Lot believed in Abraham and said I seek refuge in my Lord for He is Majestic and Allwise
We granted Isaac and Jacob to Abraham and We bestowed upon his offspring prophethood and the Book
We gave him his reward in this world and in the next life he will be among the pious ones
Lot told his people You are certainly committing the kind of indecency which no one in the world has committed before
Do you engage in carnal relations with men rob the travellers and commit evil in your gatherings
His people had no answer but to say Bring upon us the torment of God if you are truthful
He prayed Lord help me against the evildoing people
When Our angelic Messengers brought glad news to Abraham they told him We are about to destroy the people of this town for their injustice
Abraham said Lot is there in that town
They said We know everyone there
We shall certainly save him and his family except his wife who will remain behind
When Our angelic Messengers came to Lot he was grieved and depressed to see them
They told him Do not be afraid or grieved
We will rescue you and your family except your wife who will remain behind
We will bring torment from the sky on this town because of the evildeeds of its inhabitants
We left manifest evidence of the truth there for the people of understanding
We sent to the people of Midian their brother Shuayb
He told them Worship God
Have hope in the life to come
Do not spread evil in the land
They rejected him so We jolted them with a violent earthquake and they were left motionless in their houses
How the people of Ad and Thamud were destroyed is evident to you from their homes
Satan made their deeds seem attractive to them and prevented them from the right path even though they had visions
Korah the Pharaoh and Haman were also destroyed
Moses had brought them illustrious miracles but they were puffedup with pride in the land and they could not defeat Us
We punished all of these people because of their sin
Some of them were struck by a violent sandstorm some by a blast of sound others were swallowed up by the earth and some were drowned in the sea
God did not do injustice to them but they had wronged themselves
The belief of considering other things as one s guardians besides God is as feeble as a spider s web The spider s web is the frailest of all dwellings if only they knew it
God knows whatever they worship besides Him He is the Majestic and Allwise
These are parables which We tell to human being but only the learned ones understand them
God has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
In this there is evidence of the truth for the believers
Muhammad recite to them what has been revealed to you in the Book and be steadfast in prayer prayer keeps one away from indecency and evil
It is the greatest act of worshipping God
God knows what you do
Do not argue with the People of the Book except only by the best manner except the unjust among them
Tell them We believe in what is revealed to us and to you
Our Lord and your Lord is one
We have submitted ourselves to His will
We have revealed the Book to you
Some of the People of the Book and some of the pagans also believe in it
No one rejects Our revelations except the infidels
You were not able to read or write before the Quran was revealed to you otherwise the followers of falsehood would have tried to confuse the matter
In fact the Quran consists of illustrious verses that exist in the hearts of those who have knowledge
No one rejects Our revelations except the unjust ones
They say Why a miracle is not sent to him from his Lord
Say Miracles are in the hands of God
I am simply a warner
Is it not enough for them that We have revealed the Book to you to be recited to them
It is a mercy and a reminder for the believers
Say God is sufficient as a witness between me and you
He knows all that is in the heavens and the earth
Those who have faith in falsehood and disbelieve in God are certainly lost
They demand you to bring upon them torment immediately
Had not the time been fixed the torment would certainly have approached them
It would have come to them suddenly and they would not have even realized how it came
They demand you to bring upon them the torment immediately
Hell will certainly engulf the unbelievers
They will be told on the Day of Judgment when the torment will surround them from all sides Suffer the consequences of your deeds
My believing servants My land is vast Worship Me alone
Every soul will experience the agony of death and to Me you will all return
We shall give mansions in Paradise wherein streams flow to the righteously striving believers and therein they will live forever
How blessed is the reward of the hard working people
who have exercised patience and who have had trust in their Lord
There are many living creatures which do not carry their sustenance but God provides them and you with sustenance He is Allhearing and Allknowing
If you ask them Who has created the heavens and the earth and has subdued the sun and moon They will say God has done it
So why are they wandering about
God increases the sustenance of whichever of His servants He wants and He determines their share
God has the knowledge of all things
If you ask them Who has sent down water from the sky to revive the dead earth
They will say God has done it
Say It is only God who deserves all praise but many of them do not understand
The worldly life is not more than a childish game
It is the life hereafter which will be the real life if only they knew it
When they sail in a boat they sincerely pray to God with pure faith
But when We bring them safely to land they start considering things equal to God
Let them be ungrateful to what We have granted them Let them enjoy themselves but they will soon know the consequences of their deeds
Have the pagans not seen that We have made the holy precinct a safe place while all the people around are suffering terror
Do they believe in falsehood and disbelieve in God s bounties
Who is more unjust than one who invents falsehood against God or rejects the Truth after it has come to him
Is not hell the dwelling for the disbelievers
We shall certainly guide those who strive for Our cause to Our path
God is certainly with the righteous ones
Alif Lam
The Romans have been defeated in a nearby land and after this defeat
within a few years they will be victorious
All matters of the past and future are in the hands of God
The believers will enjoy the help of God on that Day
He helps whomever He wants
He is Majestic and Allmerciful
This is the promise of God
God does not ignore His promise but many people do not know
They only know the superficial realities of the worldly life and they are unaware of the life to come
Have they not thought that God has not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them but for a genuine purpose to exist for an appointed term
Many people do not believe in their meeting with their Lord
Have they not travelled through the land to see how terrible was the end of the people who lived before them
The people who lived before them were stronger than them in might in tilling and in developing the earth
Our Messengers came to them with clear miracles
God did not do an injustice to them but they wronged themselves
The end of the evildoers was terrible for they had rejected the revelations of God and mocked them
God begins the creation then causes it to turn back and to Him you will all return
On the day when the Hour of Doom comes the criminals will despair
None of the idols will intercede for them and they will reject their idols
When that day comes people will be separated from one another
The righteously striving believers will happily live in paradise
However the disbelievers who called Our revelations and the Day of Judgment lies will be brought into torment
Glory belongs to God all the time in the evening and in the morning
To Him belongs all the thanks giving which takes place in the heavens and the earth in the evenings and the noontime
He brings forth the living from the dead takes out the dead from the living and revives the earth from its death
Thus you will all be brought back to life again
Some evidence of His existence are His creating you from clay and from that you became human beings scattered all around
His creating spouses for you out of yourselves so that you might take comfort in them and His creating love and mercy among you
In this there is evidence of the truth for the people who carefully think
Other evidence of His existence are the creation of the heavens and the earth and the differences of languages and colors
In this there is evidence of the truth for the worlds mankind
Your sleeping during the night and in the day your seeking His favors are evidence of the truth for the people who have hearing
Also of the evidence of His existence are His showing you lightening which gives you fear and hope and His sending water down from the sky which revives the earth after its death
In this there is evidence of the truth for the people of understanding
Some other evidence of His existence is that both the heavens and the earth stand firm at His command When He will call you from the earth you will start to come out
Everyone in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him and is subservient to Him
It is He who begins the creation then turns it back
For Him this is very easy
All the exalted attributes in the heavens and the earth belong to Him
He is the Majestic and Allwise
God has told you this parable about yourselves Could your slaves share your wealth equally with you and could you fear them as you fear yourselves Thus do We clarify the evidence of the truth for the people of understanding
In fact the unjust have followed their desires without knowledge
Who will guide those whom God has caused to go astray
No one will be their helper
Muhammad be devoted to the upright religion
It is harmonious with the nature which God has designed for people
The design of God cannot be altered
Thus is the upright religion but many people do not know
Turn in repentance to Him
Have fear of Him
Be steadfast in your prayer Do not be like the pagans
who have divided themselves into various religious sects each one happy with their own belief
When people face hardship they begin praying to their Lord and turn in repentance to Him
When they receive mercy from Him a group of them begin to consider things equal to God
because of their ingratitude for what We have given them
Let them enjoy themselves but they will soon know the consequences of their deeds
Have We sent them any authority to speak in support of their idols
When people receive mercy they are happy with it
However when hardship befalls them because of their own deeds they despair
Have they not seen how God increases the livelihood of whomever He wants and determines his share
In this there is evidence of the truth for the believing people
Give the relatives the destitute and the needy travellers their share of charity
It is better for those who want to please God and they will have everlasting happiness
God will not allow to increase whatever illegal interest you try to receive in order to increase your wealth at the expense of people s property
Whatever amount of zakat you give to please God will be doubled for you
It is God who has created you and given you sustenance
He will make you die and will bring you back to life
Can any of your idols do such things
God is too Exalted to be considered equal to anything else
Evil has spread over the land and the sea because of human deeds and through these God will cause some people to suffer so that perhaps they will return to Him
Muhammad tell them Travel through the land to see how terrible was the end of those who lived before
Many of them were pagans
Be devoted to the upright religion before the coming of the inevitable day when no one can escape from God and people will either be sent to Paradise or hell
Those who disbelieve do so against their own souls
Those who do good pave the way for their own benefit
God will reward the righteously striving believers through His favor
He does not love the unbelievers
Some evidence of His existence is His sending the gladnewsbearing winds so that He would let you to receive His mercy cause the ships to sail by His command and let you seek His favor so that perhaps you would give Him thanks
Muhammad We had sent before you Our Messengers to their people
The Messengers showed them clear miracles and We took revenge on the criminals
It was necessary for Us to help the believers
It is God who sends the winds to raise the clouds He spreads them in the sky as He wants then He intensifies them and then you can see the rain coming down from the cloud
When He sends it down upon whichever of His servants He wants they rejoice
at the rainfall though before that they had been in despair
Look at the traces of the mercy of God how He has revived the dead earth
God revives the dead He has power over all things
Even if We had sent the wind and caused the plants to turn yellow and to fade away they would still have remained in disbelief
You cannot make the dead listen nor the deaf hear Thus they the disbelievers turn away on their heels
You cannot guide the straying blind
You can make no one listen except those who believe in Our revelations and are Muslims
It is God who has created you weak then given you strength after your weakness and caused you to become weak and old after being strong
He creates whatever He wants
He is Allknowing and Allpowerful
On the day when the Hour of Doom comes the criminals will swear that they have remained in their graves for no more than an hour They had been inventing lies in this way
Those who have received knowledge and have faith will say By the decree of God you have remained for the exact period which was mentioned in the Book of God about the Day of Resurrection
This is the Day of Resurrection but you did not know
The excuses of the unjust on this day will be of no avail to them and they will not be able to please God
We have told people various parables in this Quran
Even if you had shown them a miracle the unbelievers would have said You are only the followers of falsehood
Thus does God seal the hearts of those who do not know
Be patient
The promise of God is certainly true
Let not the faithless make you despair of the promise of God
Alif Lam
These are the verses of the Book of wisdom
A guidance and mercy for the righteous
people who are steadfast in prayer pay the religious tax and have firm belief in the life to come
They follow the guidance of their Lord and they will have everlasting happiness
In an attempt to show that God s revelations are only ancient legends some people pay for meaningless tales to draw others attention away from the Quran without knowledge and treat as a matter of fun
They will suffer a humiliating torment
When Our revelations are recited to them they turn back on their heels out of pride as if they did not hear them or their ears had been sealed off
Warn them of the painful torment
The righteously striving believers will enter Paradise
wherein they will live forever
It is the true promise of God
He is Majestic and Allwise
He has created the heavens without pillar as you can see fixed the mountains on earth so that it may not shake you away and settled therein all types of living creatures
We have sent down water from the sky and made all kinds of plants grow in gracious pairs
This is the creation of God
Show me what those whom you consider equal to God have created
In fact the unjust ones are in plain error
We gave wisdom to Luqman so that he would give thanks to God
Those who give thanks to God do so for their own good
Those who are ungrateful should know that God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
Luqman advised his son telling him My son do not consider anything equal to God for it is the greatest injustice
Concerning his parents We advised the man whose mother bears him with great pain and breastfeeds him for two years to give thanks to Me first and then to them to Me all things proceed
If they try to force you to consider things equal to Me which you cannot justify equal to Me do not obey them
Maintain lawful relations with them in this world and follow the path of those who turn in repentance to Me
To Me you will all return and I shall tell you all that you have done
My son God keeps the records of all the good and evil deeds even if they are as small as a grain of mustard seed hidden in a rock or in the heavens or the earth
God is subtle and Allaware
My son be steadfast in prayer Make others do good
Prevent them from doing evil Be patient in hardship
Patience comes from faith and determination
Do not scornfully turn your face away from people
Do not walk around puffedup with pride God does not love arrogant and boastful people
Be moderate in your walking and your talking
The most unpleasant sound is the braying of donkeys
Have you not seen that God has made all that is in the heavens and the earth subservient to you human beings and has extended and perfected for you His apparent and unseen bounties
Some people argue about God without knowledge guidance or an enlightening book
When they are told to follow what God has revealed to them they say We shall only follow our father s way of life
Will they follow it even if it is Satan who is calling them to the burning torment
Whoever submits himself to the will of God in righteousness has certainly achieved a stronghold
The end of all things is in the hands of God
Muhammad do not let the disbelievers grieve you
To Us they will all return and We shall tell them all about what they have done
God knows best what is in everyone s hearts
We shall allow them to enjoy themselves for a short while then force them into severe torment
If you ask them Who has created the heavens and the earth they will certainly say God has created them
Say It is only God who deserves all praise but most of them do not know
To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
He is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
If all the trees in the earth were pens and the ocean with seven more oceans were ink still these could not suffice to record all the Words of God
God is Majestic and Allwise
For God your creation and your resurrection are only like the creation and resurrection of one soul
God is Allhearing and Allseeing
Have you not seen that God causes the night to enter into the day and the day into the night He has made the sun and moon subservient to Himself
Each moves in an orbit for an appointed time
God is certainly Allaware of what you do
This is because God is the supreme Truth and whatever they worship besides Him is falsehood
God is the Most High and the Most Great
Have you not seen that the ships sail in the ocean through the bounty of God so that He may show you the evidence of His existence
There is evidence of the truth in this for every forbearing and grateful one
When the waves cover them like shadows they pray to God with sincerity in their religion but when We bring them safely to land only some of them follow the right path
No one rejects Our revelations except the treacherous ungrateful ones
Mankind have fear of your Lord and the day when a father will be of no avail to his son nor will a son carry any part of the burden of his father The promise of God is true Do not let the worldly life deceive you nor let your pride deceive you about God
Only God has the knowledge of the coming of the Hour of Doom
He sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs No soul is aware of what it will achieve tomorrow and no soul knows in which land it will die
God is Allknowing and Allaware
Alif Lam
There is no doubt that this Book is revealed by the Lord of the Universe
Do they say that he Muhammad has invented it
No it is the truth from your Lord so that you will warn the people who have not received a warning before you
Perhaps they will seek guidance
God is the one who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days then He established His dominion over the Throne
No one besides Him is your guardian or intercessor
Will you then not take heed
He sends the regulation of the affair from the heavens to the earth then on the day which is equal to one thousand years of yours it will ascend to Him
He knows the unseen and the seen He is Majestic and Allmerciful
It is He Who created everything in the best manner and began the creation of the human being from clay
He made His offspring come into existence from an extract of insignificant fluid
then He gave it proper shape and blew His spirit in it
He made ears eyes and hearts for you but you give Him very little thanks
They have said How can we be brought to life again after we have been lost in the earth
In fact they have no faith in the Day of Judgment
Muhammad say The angel of death who is appointed over everyone of you will cause you to die and to your Lord you will all return
Would that you could see on the Day of Judgment that criminals with their heads hanging down before their Lord saying Our Lord we have seen and heard
Send us back to act righteously
Now we have strong faith
Had We wanted We could have given guidance to every soul but My decree that hell will be filledup with jinn and people has already been executed
They will be told Suffer on this Day of Judgment
For your having ignored it We have ignored you
Suffer everlasting torment for your evil deeds
The only people who believe in Our revelations are those who when reminded about them bow down in prostration and glorify their Lord with His praise without pride
Their sides giveup rest in beds in order to pray before their Lord in fear and hope They spend for the cause of God out of what we have given them
No soul knows what delight awaits them as the reward for their deeds
Is a believer equal to an evildoer
They are not equal at all
The righteously striving believers will have Paradise for their dwelling as the reward of their good deeds
However the dwelling of the sinful ones will be hell fire
Each time they try to come out they will be turned back with this remark Suffer the torment of the fire which you had called a lie
We shall certainly make them suffer worldly torment before suffering the great torment so that perhaps they may return to Us
Who are more unjust than those who are reminded of the revelation of their Lord but have ignored them
We will take revenge on the criminal
We gave the Book to Moses do not have any doubt about the Day of Judgment and made it a guide for the children of Israel
We appointed some of the Israelites as leaders for their exercising patience to guide the others to Our commands They had firm belief in Our revelations
Your Lord will issue His decree about their believers and disbeliever s differences on the Day of Judgment
Was it not a lesson for them the unbelievers that We destroyed the many generations living before them among whose ruined dwellings they are now walking
In this there is many evidence of the truth
Will they not then listen
Have they not seen that We drive the water to the barren land and cause crops to grow which they and their cattle consume
Why then they will not see
They say If what you say is true when will the final triumph come
Say On the day of the final triumph the faith of the disbelievers will be of no avail to them nor will they be given any respite
Turn away from them and wait They are also waiting
Prophet have fear of God and do not yield to the infidels and hypocrites
God is Allknowing and Allwise
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord
God is Allaware of what you do
Trust in God and be sure that He is a Sufficient Guardian
God has not created two hearts inside any one human being
God does not consider your wives whom you renounce by zihar as your mothers nor those whom you adopt as your sons
These are only words of your mouth
God tells the Truth and shows the right path
Call them sons of their own fathers
It is more just in the eyes of God
If you do not know their fathers they are your brothers and friends in religion
You will not be responsible for your mistakes but you will be responsible for what you do intentionally
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
The Prophet has more authority over the believers than themselves
His wives are their mothers
The relatives are closer to each other according to the Book of God than the believers and the emigrants
However you may show kindness to your guardians
This also is written in the Book
We had a solemn covenant with you Muhammad and the Prophets Noah Abraham Moses and Jesus the son of Mary
This was a firm agreement God will ask the truthful ones about their truthfulness and prepare a painful torment for the disbelievers
Believers recall God s favor to you when the army attacked you
We sent a wind and the armies which you did not see to support you
God sees all that you do
Eyes became dull and hearts almost reached the throat when they attacked you from above and below and you started to think of God with suspicion
There the believers were tested and tremendously shaken
It was there that the hypocrites and those whose hearts were sick said The promise of God and His Messenger has proved to be nothing but deceit
It was there that a group of them said People of Yathrib turn back for there is no place for you to stay
Another group asking for the Prophet s permission said Our homes are defenseless
In fact they were not defenseless
They only wanted to run away
Had the army of the enemies invaded their homes and asked them to giveup their religion they would have yielded to them without delay
They had certainly promised God that they would not turn away
To promise God is certainly a great responsibility
Muhammad tell them Running away will never be of any benefit to you even if you run away from death or being killed Still you would not be able to enjoy yourselves except for a short while
Say Who can prevent God from punishing you or granting you mercy
They will not find anyone besides God as their guardian or helper
God certainly knows those among you who create obstacles on the way that leads to God and those who say to their brothers Come quickly to us and very rarely take part in the fighting
They are niggardly in spending for you
When fear comes you can see them looking at you their eyes rolling about like to faint because of the agony of death
When their fear subsides they start to bite you with their sharp tongues They are miserly in spending for a virtuous cause and have no faith
God has turned their deeds devoid of all virtue
This was not at all difficult for God
They think that the confederate tribes have not yet gone
If the confederate tribes were to attack them they would have wished to be left alone among the bedouin Arabs where they would only follow the news about you
Even if they were with you only a few of them would take part in the fight
The Messenger of God is certainly a good example for those of you who have hope in God and in the Day of Judgment and who remember God very often
On seeing the confederate tribes the believers said This is what God and His Messenger had promised us
The promise of God and His Messenger is true
This only strengthens their faith and their desire of submission to the will of God
Among the believers there are people who are true in their promise to God
Some of them have already passed away and some of them are waiting
They never yield to any change
God will certainly reward the truthful ones for their truthfulness and punish or pardon the hypocrites as He wishes
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God repelled the unbelievers in their rage
They could not achieve anything good
God rendered sufficient support to the believers in fighting
God is Allpowerful and Majestic
God brought down those among the People of the Book who had supported the confederate tribes from their castles and struck their hearts with terror
You did away with some of them and captured the others
God made you inherit their land houses property and a land on which you had never walked
God has power over all things
Prophet tell your wives If you want the worldly life and its beauty I shall allow you to enjoy it and set you free in an honorable manner
but if you want the pleasure of God His Messenger and the life hereafter know that God has prepared a great reward for the righteous ones among you
Wives of the Prophet if anyone among you commits indecency her torment will be double
This is not at all difficult for God
To whoever of you obeys God and His Messenger and acts righteously We will give double reward and a honorable sustenance
Wives of the Prophet you are not like other women If you have fear of God do not be tender in your speech lest people whose hearts are sick may lust after you
Do not display yourselves after the manner of the preIslamic age of darkness
Be steadfast in the prayer pay the religious tax and obey God and His Messenger
People of the house God wants to remove all kinds of uncleanliness from you and to purify you thoroughly
Wives of the Prophet remember the revelations of God and Words of wisdom that are recited in your homes
God is Most Kind and Allaware
God has promised forgiveness and great rewards to the Muslim men and the Muslim women the believing men and the believing women the obedient men and the obedient women the truthful men and the truthful women the forbearing men and the forbearing women the humble men and the humble women the almsgiving men and the almsgiving women the fasting men and the fasting women the chaste men and the chaste women and the men and women who remember God very often
The believing men and women must not feel free to do something in their affairs other than that which has been already decided for them by God and His Messenger
One who disobeys God and His Messenger is in plain error
Say to the person to whom you and God have granted favor Keep your wife and have fear of God
You hide within yourself what God wants to make public
You are afraid of people while it is God whom one should fear When Zayd set her free We gave her in marriage to you so that the believers would not face difficulties about the wives of their adopted sons when they are divorced
God s decree has already been issued
The Prophet cannot be blamed for carrying out the commands of God
It was the tradition of God with those who lived before
The command of God has already been decreed and ordained
Those who preach the message of God and are humble before Him should not be afraid of anyone besides God
God is Sufficient in keeping the account
Muhammad is not the father of any of your males
He is the Messenger of God and the last Prophet
God has the knowledge of all things
Believers remember God very often
and glorify Him both in the mornings and in the evenings
It is He who forgives you and His angels pray for you so that He will take you out of darkness into light
God is Allmerciful to the believers
On the day when they will be brought into the presence of their Lord their greeting to each other will be Peace be with you
God has prepared an honorable reward for them
Prophet We have sent you as a witness a bearer of glad news a warner
a preacher for God by His permission and as a shining torch
Give glad news to the believers of their receiving great favor from God
Do not yield to the disbelievers or the hypocrites
Ignore their annoying you Trust in God
God is your all Sufficient Protector
Believers if you marry believing women and then divorce them before the consummation of the marriage they do not have to observe the waiting period Give them their provisions and set them free in an honorable manner
Prophet We have made lawful for you your wives whom you have given their dowry slave girls whom God has given to you as gifts the daughters of your uncles and aunts both paternal and maternal who have migrated with you The believing woman who has offered herself to the Prophet and whom the Prophet may want to marry will be specially for him not for other believers
We knew what to make obligatory for them concerning their wives and slave girls so that you would face no hardship because we have given distinction to you over the believers
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
You may refuse whichever of the woman who offer themselves to you as you want and accept whichever of them you wish
There is no blame on you if you marry one whom you had refused previously
This would be more delightful for them They should not be grieved but should be happy with whatever you have given to every one of them
God knows what is in your hearts
God is Allknowing and Allforbearing
Besides these other women are not lawful for you to marry nor is it lawful for you to exchange your wives for the wives of others except for the slave girls even though they may seem attractive to you
God is watchful over all things
Believers do not enter the houses of the Prophet for a meal without permission if you are invited you may enter but be punctual so that you will not be waiting while the meal is being prepared
When you have finished eating leave his home Do not sit around chatting among yourselves
This will annoy the Prophet but he will feel embarrassed to tell you
God does not feel embarrassed to tell you the truth
When you want to ask something from the wives of the Prophet ask them from behind the curtain
This would be more proper for you and for them
You are not supposed to trouble the Prophet or to ever marry his wives after his death for this would be a grave offense in the sight of God
Whether you reveal something or hid it God has the knowledge of all things
It will not be an offense for the wives of the Prophet not to observe the modest dress in the presence of their fathers sons brothers sons of their brothers and sisters their own women and their slavegirls
They should have fear of God
God witness all things
God showers His blessings upon the Prophet and the angels seek forgiveness for him
Believers pray for the Prophet and greet him with Peace be with you
Those who annoy God and His Messenger will be condemned by God in this life and in the life to come He has prepared for them a humiliating torment
Those who annoy the believing men and women without reason will bear the sin for a false accusation a manifest offense
Prophet tell your wives daughters and the wives of the believers to cover their bosoms and breasts
This will make them distinguishable from others and protect them from being annoyed
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
If the hypocrites those whose hearts are sick and those who encourage the spread of evil in the city will not desist We shall arouse you against them and they will only be allowed to be your neighbors for a short while
They will be condemned wherever they are and will be sized and done away with for good
This was the tradition of God with those who lived before
There will never be any change in the tradition of God
Muhammad people ask you about the Day of Judgment
Say Only God has knowledge about it
Perhaps the Hour of Doom will soon come to pass
God has condemned the unbelievers and prepared for them a burning torment
wherein they will live forever without being able to find any guardian or helper
On the day when their faces will be turned from side to side on the fire they will say Would that we had obeyed God and the Messenger
They will say Lord we obeyed our chiefs and elders and they caused us to go astray
Lord make them to suffer double torment and subject them to the greatest condemnation
Believers do not be like those who annoyed Moses
God proved him to be innocent of what they had said about him
Moses was a honorable person in the sight of God
Believers have fear of God and speak righteous words
God will reform your deeds and forgive your sins
One who obeys God and His Messenger will certainly achieve a great success
We offered Our Trust Our deputation to the heavens to the earth and to the mountains but they could not bear this burden and were afraid to accept it Mankind was able to accept this offer but he was unjust to himself and ignorant of the significance of this Trust
As a result of this God will punish the hypocrites and the pagans but He will accept the repentance of the believers
God is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
It is only God who deserves all praise
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth and it is only He who deserves to be praised in the life to come He is Allwise and Allaware
He knows all that enters the earth all that comes out of it all that descends from the sky and all that ascends to it
He is Allmerciful and Allforgiving
The disbelievers have said There will be no Hour of Doom
Say By my Lord it certainly will come My Lord knows the unseen
Not even an atom s weight in the heavens or the earth remains hidden from Him
Nothing exists greater or smaller than this without its record in the illustrious Book
God will certainly reward the righteously striving believers
These are the ones who will receive forgiveness and honorable sustenance
However those who try to challenge Our revelations will face the most painful torment
Those who have been given knowledge will see that whatever has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth and that it guides to the straight path of the Majestic and Praiseworthy One
The unbelievers have said Should we tell you about a man who says that you will be brought back to life again after your having been completely disintegrated
Has he invented this falsehood against God or is he possessed by jinn
However those who do not have any faith in the life to come will suffer torment for their serious error
Have they not seen the heavens and the earth in front and behind them
Had We wanted We could have caused the earth to swallow them up or made a part of the sky fall upon them
In this there is evidence of the truth for every repenting person
We granted David a favor by commanding the mountains and birds to sing Our praise along with him and softened iron for him
so that he could make coats of mail and properly measure their rings
We told him and his people to act righteously
We are WellAware of what you do
We made subservient to Solomon the wind that travelled a month s journey in the morning and a month s journey in the evening
We made a stream of brass flow for him and some of the jinn worked for him by his Lord s command
We would make whichever of them jinn who turned away from Our command to suffer a burning torment
They would make for him anything that he wanted like fortresses statues large basins like reservoirs and huge immovable cooking pots
It was said Family of David worship and act gratefully
Only few of my servants are grateful
When We decreed that Solomon should die no one knew of his death except for a creeping creature of the earth who ateup his staff
When he fell down the jinn realized that if they had known about the unseen they would not have remained in such a humiliating torment for so long
There was evidence of the truth for the people of Sheba in their homeland
We gave them two gardens one on the left and one on the right and told them Consume the sustenance which your Lord has given to you and give Him thanks
You have a blessed land and an Allforgiving Lord
They ignored the evidence and We sent to them a flood arising from a broken dam
Nothing was left in their gardens but bitter fruits some tamarisk and a few lotus trees
This was how We recompensed them for their ungratefulness and thus do We recompense the ungrateful ones
We established between them and the town that We had blessed other towns nearby and thus made it easier to travel
We told them Travel there safely day and night
They said Lord make the distances of our journeys longer
They did injustice to themselves and We turned their existence into ancient tales by making them disintegrate totally
In this there is evidence of the truth for every forbearing and grateful person
Iblis satan made his judgment about them to come true
They all followed them except a believing group among them
He did not have any authority over them except to the extent that would allow Us to know who had faith in the life to come and who had doubts about it
Your Lord is a Guard over all things
Say Muhammad Ask help from those whom you worship besides God
They do not possess an atom s weight in the heavens and the earth have no share therein nor will any of their idols be able to support them
No intercession with Him will be of any benefit except that of those whom He has granted permission
The angels cannot intercede They are always submissive to their Lord
Fear vanishes from their heart when they receive a message from their Lord They ask each other What did your Lord say
Others answer He spoke the Truth
He is the Most High and the Most Great
Say Who provides you with sustenance from the heavens and the earth Say It is God
Only one group among us has the true guidance
The others must certainly be in plain error
Say You will not be questioned about our sins nor shall we about your deeds
Say Our Lord will gather us all together and issue the true Judgment about our differences
He is the Best Judge and Allknowing
Say Show me those whom you have related to God as His partner
He is too Exalted to have any partners
He is the Majestic and Allwise God
We have sent you as a bearer of glad news and a warner to the whole of mankind but most people do not know
They say When will the Day of Judgment be if what you say is true
Say That day has already been decreed for you and you cannot change the time of its coming even by a single hour
The unbelievers have said We shall never believe in this Quran nor in the Bible
Would that you could see the unjust having been halted in the presence of their Lord exchanging words among themselves The oppressed among them will say to their oppressors Had it not been for you we would certainly have been believers
The suppressing ones will say to the oppressed ones Did we prevent you from having guidance after it had come to you
In fact you yourselves were criminals
The oppressed ones will say to them It was you who planned night and day ordering us to disbelieve God and consider other things equal to Him
They will hide their regret on seeing their torment
We shall chain the necks of the disbelievers
Can they be recompensed with other than what they deserved for their deeds
Every time We sent a warner to a town the rich ones therein said to Our Messenger We have no faith in what you have brought to us
We are the ones who have more wealth and children and we shall suffer no punishment
Say My Lord increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants but most people do not know
Your property and children cannot bring you closer to Us
Only those who believe and act righteously will have double reward for their deeds and will live in secure mansions
Those who try to challenge Our revelations will be driven into torment
Say It is my Lord who determines and increases the sustenance of whomever He wants
He will replace whatever you spend for His cause and He is the best Sustainer
On the day when God will rise them all together and ask the angels Had these people been worshipping you
They will reply All glory belongs to you
You are our guardian not they
They had been worshipping the jinn and most of them had strong faith
None of them can help or harm each other on this day
We shall tell the unjust ones Suffer the torment of the fire which you had called a lie
When Our illustrious revelations are recited to them they say This man only wants to prevent you from worshipping what your father s had worshipped They say This the Quran is a mere invented lie
The unbelievers have said about the truth when it came to them This only is plain magic
We did not send to them the pagans any books to study nor a Messenger to warn them and those who lived before them had rejected the Truth
These people have not one tenth of power or wealth that we had given to those who lived before them They called Our Messengers liars Thus how terrible was My vengeance
Say I advise you to believe only in One God and worship Him individually or two people together Think carefully your companion is not possessed by jinn
He is only warning you of the coming severe torment
Say Whatever reward I ask you for my preaching will be for your own good
No one can reward me except God
He is the Witness over all things
Say My Lord speaks the Truth
He has the knowledge of the unseen
Say The truth has come
Falsehood has vanished and it will not come back again
Say If I go astray it will only be against my own soul but if I receive guidance it will be through my Lord s revelations
He is Allhearing and Omnipresent
Would that you could see how the unbelievers will be terrified by death from which they cannot escape
They will be seized from a nearby place
and then they will say We have faith in the Quran
How can they have any faith when they are far away from this world
They had rejected it in their worldly life and expressed disbelief at the unseen Day of Judgment considering it less than a remote possibility
A gulf will exist between them and their desires on the Day of Judgment like the similar people who lived before
They too had lived in doubt and uncertainty about the life hereafter
All praise belongs to God the creator of the heavens and the earth who has made the angels Messengers of two or three or four wings
He increases the creation as He wills
God has power over all things
No one can withhold whatever mercy God grants to the human being nor can one release whatever He withholds
He is Majestic and Allwise
People remember the bounty of God that He has granted to you
Is their any creator besides God who could provide you with sustenance from the heavens and the earth
He is the only God
Where then can you turn away
If they reject you other Messengers had certainly been rejected before you
All decisions are in the hands of God
People the promise of God is true
Let not the worldly life deceive you
Let not the devil deceive you about God
Satan is your enemy Thus consider him as your enemy
His party only calls you to make you the dwellers of the burning fire
The unbelievers will suffer a severe torment but the righteously striving believers will receive forgiveness and a great reward
Can one whose evil deeds seem attractive and virtuous to him be compared to a truly righteous person
God guides or causes to go astray whomever He wants
Muhammad do not be grieved because of their disbelief
God knows well whatever they do
It is God who sends the winds to raise the clouds
We then drive them unto barren areas and revive the dead earth
The Resurrection will also be executed in the same way
Whoever seeks honor should know that all honor belongs to God
Good words worship will be presented before Him and He will accept good deeds
Those who make evil plans will suffer intense torment
Their evil plans are doomed to destruction
God created you from clay which He then turned into a living germ and made you into pairs
No female conceives or delivers without His knowledge
No one grows older nor can anything be reduced from one s life without having its record in the Book
This is not at all difficult for God
The two oceans one sweet and the other salty are not alike
From each you can eat fresh meat and obtain ornaments to use
You see ships ploughing their way through them so that you may seek His favor and give Him thanks
He causes the night to enter into the day and the day to enter into the night
He has made subservient to Himself the sun and moon each moving in an orbit for an appointed time
Such is God your Lord to whom belongs the kingdom
Those whom you worship besides Him do not posses even a single straw
They will not listen to your prayers if you pray to them Even if they would listen they would not be able to answer you
On the Day of Judgment they will reject your worship of them
Not even an expert reporter can tell you the truth in the way that God can do
People you are always in need of God and God is Selfsufficient and Praiseworthy
He could replace you by a new creation if He decided to
This would not cost God dear at all
No one will bear the burden of another
Even if an overburdened soul should ask another to bear a part of his burden no one not even a relative will do so
Muhammad you can only warn those who have fear of their Lord without seeing Him and who are steadfast in prayer
Whoever purifies himself does so for his own good
To God do all things return
The blind and the seeing are not alike
nor are darkness and light
nor shade and heat
nor are the living and the dead
God makes to listen whomever He wants
Muhammad you cannot make people in the graves to listen
You are simply a warner
We have sent you in all truth as a bearer of glad news and a warner
No nation who lived before was left without a warner
If they reject you know that others who lived before them had also rejected their Messengers Messengers who had brought them miracles scriptures and the enlightening Book
so I seized the unbelievers and how terrible was their torment
Have you not seen that God has sent water down from the sky has produced fruits of various colors and has made streaks of various colors in the mountains white red and intense black
He has also created people beasts and cattle of various colors
Only God s knowledgeable servants fear Him
God is Majestic and Allpardoning
Those who recite the Book of God who are steadfast in prayer and who spend out of what We have given them for the cause of God both in public and in private have hope in an indestructible bargain
and in receiving their reward from God and in further favors
He is Allforgiving and Allappreciating
Whatever We have revealed to you from the Book is all truth It confirms what was revealed before
God sees His servants and is Allaware of them
We gave the Book as an inheritance to Our chosen servants among whom some are unjust against their souls some are moderate and some are exceedingly virtuous by the permission of God
This is indeed a great favor
They will enter the gardens of Eden wherein they will be decked with bracelets of gold pearls and silk garments
They will say It is only God who deserves all praise He has removed all of our suffering
Our Lord is certainly Allforgiving and Allappreciating
It is He who has granted us through His favor an everlasting dwelling wherein we shall experience no hardship nor any fatigue
The unbelievers will dwell in hell
It will not be decreed for them to die nor will their torment be relieved
Thus do We recompense the ungrateful ones
Therein they will cryout Lord take us out of here
We shall act righteously and behave different to what we did before
They will be told Did We not allow you to live long enough for you to seek guidance
Did We not send a warner to you
Suffer the torment
There is no one to help the unjust
God has knowledge of whatever is unseen in the heavens and the earth
He knows best what the hearts contain
It is He who has made you each other s successors on earth
Whoever disbelieves does so against his own self
The disbelief of the unbelievers will only increase the anger of their Lord and will only cause them greater loss
Muhammad ask them Think about the idols which you worship besides God Show me what part of the earth they have created
Do they have any share in the heavens
Has God sent them a Book to confirm their authority
In fact whatever the unjust promise each other is nothing but deceit
God prevents the heavens and the earth from falling apart
If they do fall apart then no one besides Him can restore them
He is Allforbearing and Allforgiving
They solemnly swear that if a warner were to come to them they would certainly have been better guided than any other nation
But when a warner came to them it only increased their hatred
because of their pride in the land and their evil plots
Evil plots only affect the plotters
Do they expect anything other than God s tradition torment with those who lived before You will never find any change in the tradition of God nor will you find any alteration in it
Have they not travelled sufficiently through the land to see how terrible was the end of the mightier people who lived before them
Nothing in the heavens or the earth can challenge God
God is Allknowing and Allpowerful
Were God to punish people for their deeds immediately not one creature would have survived on earth
However He has given them a respite for an appointed time and when their term comes to an end let it be known that God watches over His servants
I swear by Ya Sin
and the Quran the Book of wisdom
that you Muhammad are a Messenger
and that you follow the right path
This is a revelation sent down from the Majestic and Allmerciful
so that you may warn a people who are unaware because their fathers were not warned
I swear that most of them are doomed to be punished
They have no faith
We have enchained their necks up to their chins Thus they cannot bend their heads to find their way
We have setup a barrier in front of and behind them and have made them blind
Thus they cannot see
Whether you warn them or not they will not believe
You should only warn those who follow the Quran and have fear of the Beneficent God without seeing Him
Give them the glad news of their receiving forgiveness and an honorable reward from God
It is We who bring the dead to life and records the deeds of human beings and their consequences of continual effects
We keep everything recorded in an illustrious Book
Tell them the story of the people of the town to whom Messengers came
We sent them two Messengers whom they rejected
We supported them by sending a third one who told the people We are the Messengers of God who have been sent to you
The people said You are mere mortals like us and the Beneficent God has sent nothing You are only liars
They said Our Lord knows that We are Messengers
who have been sent to you Our only duty is to preach clearly to you
The people said We have ill omens about you
If you will not desist we shall stone you and make you suffer a painful torment
The Messengers said This ill omen lies within yourselves
Will you then take heed
In fact you are a transgressing people
A man came running from the farthest part of the city saying My people follow the Messengers
Follow those who do not ask you for any reward and who are rightly guided
Why should I not worship God who has created me
To him you will all return
Should I worship other gods besides Him
If the Beneficent God was to afflict me with hardship the intercession of the idols can be of no benefit to me nor could it rescue me from hardship
Had I worshipped things besides God I would have been in manifest error
Messengers listen to me
I believe in your Lord
Having been murdered by the disbelievers he was told to enter paradise
wherein he said Would that people knew how my Lord has granted me forgiveness and honor
We did not send an army against his people from the heaven after his death nor did We need to send one
It was only a single blast which made them extinct
Woe to human beings
Whenever a Messenger came to them they mocked him
Have they not seen how many generations living before them had We destroyed and they cannot ever come back to them
They will all be brought into Our presence together
Evidence of the truth for them is how We revived the dead earth
and produced therein grains from which they eat and established therein gardens of palms trees and vineyards and have made streams flow therein
so that they may consume the fruits and whatever their hands prepare
Will they not then be grateful
All glory belongs to the One Who has created pairs out of what grow from the earth out of their soul and out of that which they do not know
Of the signs for them is how We separated the day from the night and thus they remained in darkness
how the sun moves in its orbit and this is the decree of the Majestic and Allknowing God
how We ordained the moon to pass through certain phases until it seems eventually to be like a bent twig
how the sun is not supposed to catchup with the moon nor is the night to precede the day All of them are to float in a certain orbit
how We carried them and their offspring inside the laden Ark
and created for them similar things to ride
Had We wanted We could have drowned them and nothing would have been able to help or rescue them
except Our mercy which could enable them to enjoy themselves for an appointed time
Whenever they are told to guard themselves against sin and the forth coming torment so that perhaps they could receive mercy
and whenever a revelation out of their Lord s revelations comes to them they ignore it
When they are told to spend for the cause of God out of what He has provided for them for their sustenance the disbelievers say to the believers Should we feed those whom God has decided to feed
You are in plain error
The unbelievers say When will the Day of Judgment come if what you say is at all true
They will not have to wait long When the Day of Judgment comes it will only take a single blast of sound to strike them while they are quarrelling with one another
Then they will not be able to make a will or return to their families
When the trumpet is sounded they will be driven out of their grave into the presence of their Lord
They will say Woe to us
Who has raised us up from our graves
This is what the Beneficent God has promised
The Messengers have also spoke the truth
Only after a single blast of sound they will all be brought into Our presence
No soul will be in the least bit wronged on that Day and no one will receive any recompense other than what he deserves for his deeds
The dwellers of Paradise on that day will enjoy themselves
They and their spouses will recline on couches in the shade therein
They will have fruits and whatever they desire
Peace be with you will be a greeting for them from the Merciful Lord
The Lord will command Criminals stand away from the others on this day
Children of Adam did We not command you not to worship satan He was your sworn enemy
Did We not command you to worship Me and tell you that this is the straight path
Satan misled a great multitude of you
Did you not have any understanding
This is hell with which you were threatened
Suffer therein on this day for your disbelief
We shall seal your mouths on that Day let your hands speak to us and your feet testify to what you had achieved
We could have blinded them had We wanted Then they would have raced along to cross the Bridge but how could they have seen their way
We could have turned them into other creatures on the spot had We wanted and they would not have been able to precede or turn back
The physical growth of those whom We grant a long life will be reversed
Will you then not understand
We did not teach him Muhammad poetry nor was he supposed to be a poet
It is only the word of God and the illustrious Quran
by which he may warn those who are living and may let the words of God come true against the unbelievers
Have they not seen what We have created from the labor of Our own hands We have given them cattle
We have made the cattle subservient to them so they ride and consume them
From cattle they get milk and other benefits
Will they not then give thanks
They chose idols besides God in the hope of receiving help from them but they will not be able to help them
Instead the disbelievers will be brought into the presence of God as the soldiers of the idols
Muhammad let not their words annoy you
We certainly know whatever they conceal or reveal
Has the human being not considered that We have created him from a drop of fluid He is openly quarrelsome
He questions Our Resurrection of him but has forgotten his own creation He has said Who will give life to the bones which have become ashes
Muhammad tell him He who gave them life in the first place will bring them back to life again
He has the best knowledge of all creatures
He has created fire for you out of the green tree from which you can kindle other fires
Is the One who has created the heavens and the earth not able to create another creature like the human being
He certainly has the power to do so
He is the Supreme Creator and is Allknowing
Whenever He decides to create something He has only to say Exist and it comes into existence
All glory belongs to the One in whose hands is the control of all things
To Him you will all return
I swear by the angels who stand in ranks
by those who drive away the devil to protect Our revelation
and those who recite Our revelations
that your Lord is the only Lord
He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the Lord of the Eastern regions
We have decked the lower heavens with stars
to protect them from the rebellious satan
The devils cannot hear those high above They would be struck from all sides
and driven away to suffer the necessary torment
Some of them who stealthily steal words from the heavens are pursued by a glistening flame
Muhammad ask them Have they people been created stronger than what We have created
We have created them from moist clay
Muhammad you will be surprised that they still mock God s revelations
They pay no attention when they are reminded
and when they see a miracle they mock
it and say It is only plain magic
They say Shall we be brought to life again after we die and turn into dust and bones
Will our forefathers also be brought to life again
Say You will certainly be brought back to life in disgrace
The Day of Judgment will come within a single roar and they will remain gazing at it
They will say Woe to us
They will be told This is the day of receiving recompense
This is the Day of Judgment in which you disbelieved
God will command the angels Gather together the unjust their spouses and what they had worshipped
besides God and show them the way of hell
Stop them They must be questioned
They will be asked Why do you not help each other
In fact on that day they will be submissive
They will turn to each other saying
It was you who tried to mislead us from righteousness
Others will respond It was you who did not want to have any faith
We had no authority over you in fact you were a rebellious people
Thus the words of Our Lord about us have come true and now we are suffering the torment
We mislead you and we ourselves had also gone astray
On that day they will all share the torment
This is how We deal with the criminals
They were the ones who on being told God is only One become puffedup with pride
and said Should we give up our idols for the sake of an insane poet
In fact he had brought them the truth and had acknowledged the Messengers who were sent before him
They will be told You will certainly suffer the painful torment
and will be recompensed only for what you deserve
But the sincere servants of God
will have their determined sustenance
and fruits while they are honored
They will live in the bountiful gardens
on couches facing each other
They will be served with a cup full of crystal clear wine
delicious to those who drink it
but not harmful or intoxicating
They will have with them loving wives with big black and white eyes
who are as chaste as sheltered eggs
They will turn to each other and ask questions
One of them will say I had a companion who asked me
Do you believe in the Day of Judgment
Shall we be recompensed for our deeds after we die and become bones and dust
Do you want to see him
He will look down and see him in hell
He will say to his friend in hell By God you almost destroyed me
Had I not the guidance of my Lord I would certainly have been brought into torment
He will ask his companion Did you not say that there would only be one death
and that we would not be punished
This is certainly the greatest triumph
for which one must strive hard
Is this not a better reward than the tree of Zaqqum
which We have made as a torment for the unjust
Zaqqum is a tree which grows from the deepest part of hell
and its fruits are like the heads of devils
The dwellers of hell will eat that fruit and fillup their bellies
Then they will have on top of it a mixture of boiling water
They can only return to hell
They found their father going astray
and rushed to follow them
Most of the ancient people had also gone astray
We had certainly sent warners to them
See how terrible was the end of those who were warned
Only Our sincere servants were saved
Noah called for help How blessed was the answer which he received
We rescued him and his people from the greatest affliction
and We made his offspring the only survivors
We perpetuated his praise in later generations
Peace be with Noah among all men in the worlds
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
He was one of Our believing servants
We drowned all the others besides Noah and his people
Abraham was one of his followers
He turned to his Lord with a sound heart
and asked his father and his people What is that you worship
Do you want to worship false idols as your lords besides God
What do you think about the Lord of the Universe
The people invited him to attend their feast Then he looked at the stars
and said I am sick
All the people turned away from him
and he turned to their idols and asked them Do you eat
Why do you not speak
He struck them with his right hand
Thereupon the people came running to him
He said How can you worship what you yourselves have carved
even though God created both you and that which you have made
They said Let us build a fire and throw him into the flames
They plotted against him but We brought humiliation upon them
Abraham said I will go to my Lord who will guide me
Abraham prayed Lord grant me a righteous son
We gave him the glad news of the birth of a forbearing son
When his son was old enough to work with him he said My son I have had a dream that I must sacrifice you
What do you think of this
He replied Father fulfill whatever you are commanded to do and you will find me patient by the will of God
When they both agreed and Abraham had lain down his son on the side of his face for slaughtering
We called to him Abraham
you have fulfilled what you were commanded to do in your dream
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
It was certainly an open trial
We ransomed his son with a great sacrifice
and perpetuated his praise in later generations
Peace be with Abraham
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
He was one of Our believing servants
We gave him the glad news of the birth of Isaac one of the righteous Prophets
We had blessed him and Isaac
Some of their offspring were righteous and others were openly unjust to themselves
We certainly bestowed Our favor upon Moses and Aaron
and saved them and their people from great distress
We helped them and they were victorious
We gave them the enlightening Book
guided them to the right path
and perpetuated their praise in later generations
Peace be with Moses and Aaron
Thus do We reward the righteous ones
They were two of Our believing servants
Elias was certainly a Messenger
He told his people Why do you not have fear of God
Do you worship Baal and abandon the Best Creator
who is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
They called him a liar Thus all of them will suffer torment
except the sincere servants of God
We perpetuated his praise in the later generations
Peace be with the followers of Elias
In this way do We reward the righteous ones
He was one of Our believing servants
Lot was certainly a Messenger
We rescued him and his whole family
except for an old woman who remained behind
Then We totally destroyed the others
You pass by their ruined town in the morning and at night
Will you then not understand
Jonah was certainly a Messenger
He abandoned his people
and sailed away in a laden ship wherein people cast lots
Because he lost he was thrown into the water
The fish swallowed him up and he deserved all this
Had he not glorified God
he would certainly have remained inside the fish until the Day of Resurrection
We cast him out of the fish unto dry land and he was sick
We made a plant of gourd grow up for him
We sent him to a hundred thousand or more people
They believed in him so We granted them enjoyment for an appointed time
Muhammad ask them Do daughters belong to your Lord and sons to them
Have We created the angels as females before their very eyes
It is only because of their false invention that they say
God has begotten a son
They are certainly liars
Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons
Woe to you How terrible is your Judgment
Do you not understand
Do you have clear authority
Bring your book if what you say is true
They have said that there is a relationship between Him and the jinn
The jinn certainly know that they will all be brought to suffer torment
God is too glorious to be described as they describe Him
except the servants of God sincere and devoted
You and whatever you worship
cannot mislead anyone
except those who are doomed to enter hell
The angels say Each of us has an appointed place
We stand in ranks for prayer
and we glorify God
Even though they unbelievers say
Had we received guidance from the people living before us
we would have certainly been sincere servants of God
They have rejected the Quran
They will soon know the consequences of their disbelief
We decreed that Our Messenger servants
will certainly be victorious
and that Our army will be triumphant
Muhammad stay away from them for a while
and watch them
They too will watch
Do they want to suffer Our torment immediately
When it descends into their courtyard it will be terrible for those who have already been warned
Stay away from them for a while
and watch
They too will watch
Your Lord the Lord of Honor is too exalted to be considered as they describe Him
Peace be with the Messengers of God
It is only God the Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
Sad
I swear by the Quran which is full of reminders of God that you are a Messenger
In fact the unbelievers are the ones who are boastful and quarrelsome
How many ancient generations did We destroy
On facing Our torment they cried out for help but it was too late for them to escape
It seems strange to the pagans that a man from their own people should come to them as a Prophet The unbelievers have said He is only a lying magician
They say Has he condemned all other gods but One
This is certainly strange
A group of the pagans walked out of a meeting with the Prophet and told the others Let us walk away Be steadfast in the worship of your gods
This man wants to dominate you
We have heard nothing like this in the latest religion
This is only his own false invention
Can it be that he alone has received the Quran
In fact they have doubts about My Quran and this is because they have not yet faced My torment
Do they possess the treasures of the mercy of your Muhammad s Lord the Majestic and Munificent God
Do they own the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
Let them try on their own to block the ways of heavens so that Our revelations cannot come to you
They are only a small band among the defeated confederate tribes
The people of Noah Ad and the dominating Pharaoh had rejected Our revelations
So also did the people of Thamud Lot and the dwellers of the Forest
Each of them who rejected the Messenger become subject to Our punishment
They had only to wait for the single inevitable blast
They scornfully said Lord show us the record of our deeds before the day when everyone must present the account of their deeds
Muhammad bear patiently what they say and recall Our servant David who had strong hands and who was most repentant
We made the mountains join him in glorifying Us in the evening and in the morning
We made the birds assemble around him in flocks
We strengthened his kingdom giving him wisdom and the power of sound Judgment
Have you heard the news of the disputing parties who climbed the walls of the prayer room
and entered where David was praying He was frightened so they said Do not be afraid
We are only two disputing parties of which one of us has transgressed against the other
Judge between us with truth and justice and guide us to the right path
One of them said This is my brother who has ninetynine ewes when I have only one
He has demanded me to place that one in his custody he had the stronger argument
David said He has certainly been unjust in demanding your ewe from you
Most partners transgress against each other except for the righteously striving believers who are very few
David realized that it was a test from Us so he asked forgiveness from his Lord and knelt down before him in repentance
We forgave him for this
In Our eyes he certainly has a good position and the best share of the world to come
We told him
David We have appointed you as Our deputy on earth so judge among the people with truth
Do not follow worldly desires lest you go astray from the way of God
Those who go astray from the way of God will suffer severe torment for forgetting the Day of Reckoning
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them without purpose even though this is the belief of the disbelievers
Woe to the disbelievers they will suffer the torment of fire
Do We consider the righteously striving believers equal to the evildoers in the land
Are the pious ones equal to those who openly commit sin
It is a blessed Book which We have revealed for you so that you will reflect upon its verses and so the people of understanding will take heed
We granted Solomon to David a blessed servant of Ours and certainly the most repentant person
When the noble galloping horses were displayed to him one evening
he said My love of horses for the cause of God has made me continue watching them until sunset thus making me miss my prayer
He said Bring them back to me
Then he started to rub their legs and necks
We tested Solomon by causing death to his son and leaving his body on Solomon s chair
Then he turned to Us in repentance
saying Lord forgive me and grant me a kingdom that no one after me can have the like You are Allmunificent
We made the wind subservient to him to blow gently wherever he desired at his command
and all the devils who built and dived for him
The rest of the devils were bound in chains
We told him This is Our gift to you so give them away free or keep them as you like
In Our eyes he certainly has a high position and the best place to return
Muhammad recall Our servant Job
When he prayed to his Lord saying Satan has afflicted me with hardship and torment
We answered his prayer healed his sickness and told him Run on your feet
This is cool water for you to wash and drink
We gave him back his family and doubled their number as a blessing from Us and as a reminder to the people of understanding
We told him Take a handful of straw
Strike your wife with it to fulfill your oath
We found him to be patient
What an excellent servant he was
He was certainly most repenting
Muhammad recall Our servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob all of whom possessed virtuous hands and clear visions
We gave them this pure distinction because of their continual remembrance of the Day of Judgment
In Our eyes they were of the chosen virtuous people
Recall Ismael Elisha and Dhulkifl Ezekiel who were all virtuous people
Such is their noble story
The pious ones will certainly have the best place to return
They will enter gardens of Eden with their gates open for them
They will be resting therein and will be able to ask for many kinds of fruit and drink
They will have bashful wives of equal age with them
This is what they had been promised for the Day of Judgment
Our provision for you will never be exhausted
However the rebellious ones will have the worst place to return
They will suffer in hell
What a terrible dwelling
They will be told This is your recompense
Taste the scalding water pus and other putrid things
Their leaders will be told This band will also be thrown headlong with you into hell
Their leaders will exclaim May condemnation fall upon them
Let them suffer the torment of fire
Their followers will say In fact it is you who deserve condemnation
It was you who led us to hell a terrible dwelling
They will continue saying Lord double the torment of fire for those who led us into this
But why is it that we cannot see men whom we had considered as wicked
and whom we mocked
Have they been rescued or can our eyes not find them
Such disputes will certainly take place among the dwellers of hell fire
Muhammad say I am only a warner
The only Lord is God the Almighty
He is the Lord of the heavens the earth and all that is between them the Majestic and Allforgiving
Say It facts about the supremacy of God is the greatest message
but you have turned away from it
I have no knowledge of the dispute among the angels concerning their attitude towards Adam
I have only received revelation to give you plain warning
When your Lord told the angels I will create a mortal out of clay
and when I give it proper shape and blow My spirit into it bow down in prostration to him
all the angel then prostrated themselves
except Iblis who puffed himself up with pride and became a disbeliever
The Lord said Iblis what prevented you from prostrating before what I have created with My own hands
Was it because of your pride or are you truly exalted
He said I am better than him
You have created me from fire and him out of clay
The Lord said Get out of here
You deserve to be stoned
My condemnation will be with you until the Day of Judgment
He said Lord grant me respite until the Day of Resurrection
The Lord said You will only be given a respite
for an appointed time
He said By Your Glory I shall seduce all of them children of Adam
except Your sincere servants among them
The Lord said I swear by the Truth and I speak the Truth
that I shall certainly fill hell with you and your followers all together
Muhammad say I do not ask any reward for my preaching to you for I am not a pretender
It the Quran is nothing but a reminder to you from the Lord of the Universe
You will certainly know its truthfulness after a certain time
This Book is a revelation from God the Majestic and AllWise
We have revealed the Book to you in all truth Worship God and be devoted to His religion
The religion of God is certainly pure
Concerning those whom they consider as their guardians besides God they say We only worship them so that they may make our positions nearer to God
God will certainly issue His decree about their differences
God does not guide the liars and the disbelievers
Had God wanted to have a son He would have chosen one from His creatures according to His will
God is too Exalted to have a son
He is One and Almighty
He has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose
He covers the night with the day and the day with the night and has subdued the sun and the moon each of which floats for an appointed time
God is certainly Majestic and AllForgiving
He has created you from a single soul
Out of this He created your spouse
He sent you eight pairs of cattle
He creates you for a second time in the wombs of your mothers behind three curtains of darkness
He is your Lord to whom belongs the Kingdom
He is the only Lord
Where then will you turn away
If you disbelieve know that God is certainly independent of you
He does not want disbelief for His servants
If you give thanks He will accept it from you
No one will be responsible for the sins of others
To your Lord you will all return and He will tell you about what you have done
He knows best what the hearts contain
When the human being is afflicted with hardship he starts to pray to his Lord and turns to Him in repentance
When God grants him a favor he forgets the hardship about which he had prayed to God and starts to consider equal to God things that lead him astray from His path
Muhammad tell him You can only enjoy in your disbelief for a short time
You will certainly be a dweller of hell fire
Can this one be considered equal to one who worships God during the night prostrating and standing who has fear of the Day of Judgment and who has hope in the mercy of his Lord
Say Are those who know equal to those who do not know
Only the people of reason take heed
Say to My believing servants Have fear of your Lord
Those who act righteously in this life will receive good reward
The land of God is vast
God will recompense the deeds of those who have exercised patience without keeping an account
Say I am commanded to worship God and be devoted to His religion
and I am commanded to be the first Muslim
Say I am afraid that for disobeying my Lord I shall suffer the torment of the great day
Say I worship God alone and devote myself to His religion
Worship besides Him whatever you want
The greatest losers are those whose souls and family members will be lost on the Day of Judgment for this is certainly a great loss
Above and below them their will be shadows of fire
This is how God frightens His servants
My servants have fear of Me
Those who have avoided worshipping idols and have turned in repentance to God will receive the glad news
Muhammad give the glad news to those of Our servants who listen to the words and only follow the best ones
Tell them that they are those whom God has guided
They are the people of understanding
How can you rescue the one who is destined to suffer the torment
Those who have fear of their Lord will have lofty mansions built upon mansions beneath which streams flow
It is the promise of God
God does not disregard His promise
Have you not seen that God has sent down water from the sky and made it flow as springs out of the earth
He makes crops of different colors grow with this water and flourish which then turn yellow and wither away
In this there is a reminder for the people of understanding
One whose chest heart and mind is left open for Islam submission to His will shall receive light from God
Woe to those whose hearts have become like stone against the remembrance of God
They are clearly in error
God has revealed the best reading material in the form of a Book with similar passages which refer to each other and make the skins of those who fear their Lord shiver
Then their skins and hearts incline to the remembrance of God
This is the guidance of God
He guides whomever He wants
No one can guide those whom God has caused to go astray
Is there anyone who is afraid of the torment of the Day of Judgment when the unjust will be told Suffer the result of your deeds
Those who lived before them had also rejected Our revelations
Thus the torment struck them and they did not even realize where it came from
God made them suffer humiliation in this life
Would that they knew that the torment for them in the next life will be even greater
We have given all kinds of examples for the human being in this Quran so that perhaps he may take heed
This Quran is a flawless reading text in the Arabic language Perhaps they will have fear of God
God tells a parable in which there is a company of quarrelsome people and only one of them is well disciplined
Can they be considered as equal
It is only God who deserves all praise
In fact most of them do not know
Muhammad you will die and all of them will also die
Then on the Day of Judgment all of you will present your disputes before your Lord
Who is more unjust then one who invents falsehood against God and rejects the truth after it has come to them
Is not hell a dwelling for the disbelievers
Those who have brought the truth and have acknowledged it are those who have fear of God
They will receive whatever they want from their Lord
Thus is the reward of the righteous ones
God will certainly expiate their bad deeds and reward them much more for what they have done
Is God not sufficient support for His servants
They frighten you with what they worship besides God
Who can guide one whom God has caused to go astray
Who can mislead one whom God has guided
Is God not Majestic and Revengeful
If you ask them Who has created the heavens and the earth
They will certainly say God has created them Ask them Do you think that you can rescue me from the punishment of God with which He may afflict me
Can you prevent His mercy if He wants to grant it to me
Say God is Sufficient support for me
In Him alone one must trust
Say My people act as you wish
I shall do as I like and you will soon know
who will face the humiliating torment and suffer everlasting retribution
Muhammad We have revealed the Book to you for mankind in all truth
Whoever seeks guidance does so for his own good
Whosoever goes astray goes against his own soul
You are not their representative
God will receive their souls when they die Their souls do not die when they are sleeping
During people s sleep He withholds those souls which He has decreed to die and releases the others for an appointed time
In this there is evidence of the Truth for the thoughtful people
Have they chosen intercessors besides God
Say Would you choose them as your intercessors even though they do not possess anything and have no understanding
Say Intercession belongs to God
To Him belongs the heavens and the earth and to Him you will all return
When one God is mentioned the hearts of those who do not believe in the Day of Judgment begin to shrink but when the idols are mentioned they rejoice
Say Lord the Creator of the heavens and the earth knower of the seen and unseen it is You who will issue Your decree about the differences of Your servants
Had the unjust possessed double the amount of the wealth of the whole earth they would certainly have liked to offer it on the Day of Resurrection as redemption from the torment of Our scourge when God would make public what they had never expected
Their bad deeds will become public and they will be surrounded by the torment which they had mocked during their worldly life
When the human being is afflicted with hardship he cries out to us for help
When We grant him a favor he says I knew that I deserved it
In fact it is only a test for him but most people do not know this
People who lived before them had also said Our wealth has been earned by our own merits
What they had earned was of no benefit to them
They were afflicted by the terrible result of whatever they gained
Besides this affliction the unjust among them will also suffer the consequence of their deeds
They will not be able to challenge God
Did they not know that God determines and increases the sustenance of whomever He wants
In this there is evidence of the truth for the believing people
Muhammad tell my servants who have committed injustice to themselves Do not despair of the mercy of God
God certainly forgives all sins
He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Turn in repentance to your Lord and submit to His will before you are afflicted with the torment after which you can receive no help
Follow the best of what is revealed to you from your Lord before the torment suddenly approaches you and you will not realize how it came about
Turn to God in repentance before a soul says Woe to me because of my failure to fulfill my duties to God
Woe to me for mocking God s guidance
Or before the soul says Had God guided me I could have been a pious man
Or on seeing the torment it would say Would I have the opportunity this time I would certainly become a pious person
God will reply to the soul My revelations had certainly come to you but you rejected them You were puffedup with pride and you became an unbeliever
On the Day of Judgment you will see the faces of those who had invented falsehood against God blackened
Is not hell the dwelling of the arrogant ones
God will save the pious ones because of their virtuous deeds
No hardship will touch them nor will they be grieved
God is the Creator and Guardian of all things
In His hands are the keys of the treasuries of the heavens and the earth
Those who reject God s revelations will be lost
Muhammad say Ignorant ones do you command me to worship things other than God
even though God has said It has been revealed to you and to those who lived before you that if you consider other things equal to God your deeds will be made devoid of all virtue and you will certainly be lost
Muhammad You must worship God alone and give Him thanks
They have not paid due respect to God
The whole earth will be gripped in His hands on the Day of Judgment and the heavens will be just like a scroll in His right hand
God is too Glorious and High to be considered equal to their idols
Everyone in the heavens and the earth will faint in terror except for those whom God will save when the trumpet is sounded
They will all stand up and wait when the trumpet sounds for the second time
The Book of Records will be presented and the Prophets and witness will be summoned All will be judged with justice and no wrong will be done to anyone
Every soul will be recompensed for its deeds
God knows best whatever they have done
The disbelievers will be driven to hell in hordes
Its gates will be opened when they are brought nearby and the keepers will ask them Did Messengers from your own people not come to you to recite your Lord s revelations and to warn you about this day
They will reply Yes the Messengers did come to us but the unbelievers were doomed to face the torment
They will be told Enter the gates of hell to live therein forever
What a terrible dwelling for the arrogant ones
The pious ones will be led to Paradise in large groups
Its gates will be opened to them when they are brought nearby and its keepers will say Welcome
Peace be with you
Enter the gates of Paradise to live therein forever
They will say It is only God who deserves all praise He has made His promise come true and has given the earth as an inheritance to us
Now we live in the gardens as we wished Blessed is the reward of those who labor
Muhammad on that day you will see the angels circling around the Throne glorifying and praising their Lord
Judgment with justice will be decreed between the people of Paradise and hell and it will be said It is only God Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
Ha Mim
This Book is a revelation from God the Majestic and Allknowing
who forgives sins who accepts repentance whose punishment is severe and whose bounty is universal
He is the only Lord and to Him all things proceed
No one disputes the revelations of the Lord except the disbelievers
Let not their activities in the land deceive you
The people of Noah who lived before and the Confederate tribes who lived after them rejected Our revelations Every nation schemed against its Messengers to seize them and disputed against them to defeat the truth
But torment struck them and how terrible was their retribution
The word of your Lord that the disbelievers will be the dwellers of hell fire has already been decreed
The bearers of the Throne glorify their Lord with His praise They believe in Him and ask Him to forgive the believers
They say Our Lord Your mercy and knowledge encompass all things
Forgive those who turn to You in repentance and follow Your path Lord save them from the torment of hell
Lord admit them and their fathers spouses and offspring who have reformed themselves to the gardens of Eden which You have promised them
You are Majestic and Allwise
Lord keep them away from evil deeds
Whomever You have saved from evil on the Day of Judgment has certainly been granted Your mercy and this is the greatest triumph
The disbelievers will be told God s hatred towards you is much greater than your hatred of your own selves
You were called to the faith but you disbelieved
They say Lord You have caused us to die twice and You have brought us back to life twice We have confessed our sins so is there any way out of this hell
They will be answered Your suffering is only because you disbelieved when One God was mentioned When other things were considered equal to Him you believed in them
Judgment belongs to God the Most High the Most Great
It is He who has shown you the evidence of His existence and has sent you sustenance from the sky yet only those who turn to God in repentance take heed
Worship God and be devoted to His religion even though the disbelievers dislike this
God is the promoter of His servants and the owner of the Throne He sends His spirit by His command to whichever of His servants He wants to warn them of the Day of Judgment
Nothing will remain hidden from God concerning them on the day when they appear before God from their graves It will be asked To whom does the kingdom belong on this Day
It will be answered The kingdom belongs to the Almighty One God
Every soul will be recompensed for its deeds on this Day
There will be no injustice
Certainly God s reckoning is swift
Muhammad warn them of the approaching day when because of hardship and frustration their hearts will almost reach up to their throats
The unjust will have no friends nor any intercessor who will be heard
God knows the disloyalty of the eyes and what the hearts conceal
God judges with Truth but those whom they worship besides God can have no Judgment
God is certainly Allhearing and Allaware
Have they not travelled through the land to see the terrible end of those who lived before them
They had been mightier than them in power and in leaving their traces on earth
God punished them for their sins
They had no one to save them from God s torment
Messengers had come to them with illustrious miracles but they disbelieved and thus God struck them with His torment
He is Mighty and Severe in His retribution
We sent Moses with Our miracles and clear authority
to the Pharaoh Haman and Korah who said He is only a lying magician
When We sent him to them for a genuine purpose they said Kill the sons of those who have believed in him but keep their women alive
The plots of the unbelievers can only result in failure
The Pharaoh said Let me kill Moses and let him call for help from his Lord
I am afraid that he will change your religion or spread evil through the land
Moses said I seek protection from your and my Lord against every arrogant person who has no faith in the Day of Judgment
A believing person from the people of the Pharaoh who concealed his faith said Would you kill a man just because he says God is my Lord
He has brought you illustrious miracles from your Lord
If he speaks lies it will only harm him but if he speaks the Truth some of his warnings may affect you
God does not guide a transgressing liar
My people today you have the kingdom and the power on earth but who will help us against the wrath of God if it will befall us The Pharaoh said I show you only what I think is proper and guide you only to the right direction
The believing man said I am afraid that you will face a terrible day like that of the groups
people of Noah Ad Thamud and those after them
God did not want injustice for His servants
My people I am afraid for you on the Day of Judgment when people will cry for help
On that day you will run away but no one will be able to protect you from God s Judgment
No one can guide one whom God has caused to go astray
Joseph came to you before with illustrious evidence but you still have doubts about what he brought
When he passed away you said God will never send any Messenger after him
Thus does God causes to go astray the skeptical transgressing people
those who dispute the revelations of God without having received clear authority
This act greatly angers God and the believers
Thus does God seal the hearts of every arrogant oppressor
Pharaoh said Haman build a tower of baked bricks for me so that I shall have access
to the heavens and be able to climb up to the Lord of Moses
I think that Moses is lying
Thus Pharaoh s evil deeds seemed attractive to him and prevented him from the right path
The Pharaoh s plots only led him to his own destructor
The believing man said My people follow me and I shall show you the right guidance
My people this worldly life is only the means to an end but the life hereafter will be the everlasting abode
Whoever commits evil deeds will be recompensed to the same degree
The righteously striving believer male or female will enter Paradise wherein they will receive their sustenance without any account being kept
My people How strange is it that I invite you to salvation when you invite me to the fire
You call me to disbelieve in God and to believe other things equal to Him about which I have no knowledge I call you to the Majestic and Allforgiving One
The idols to which you invite me certainly have no claim to be deities in this world or in the life to come
Our return is to God and the transgressors will be the dwellers of hell fire
You will soon recall what I have told you
I entrust God with my affairs
God is Well Aware of His servants
God protected him against their evil plans and the people of the Pharaoh were struck by the most horrible torment
They will be exposed to the fire in the mornings and the evenings and on the Day of Judgment they will be told People of the Pharaoh suffer the most severe torment
During a dispute in the fire the suppressed ones will say to those who had dominated them We were your followers
Can you now relieve us of our suffering in the fire
The ones who had dominated them will say All of us are now in hell
God has already issued His Judgment of His servants and no one can change this
The dwellers of hell fire will ask its keepers Pray to your Lord to relieve us from the torment at least for one day
The keepers will ask them Did your Messengers not come to you with illustrious evidence of the Truth
They will reply Yes they did
The keepers will then say You may pray but the prayer of the disbelievers will not be answered
We shall help Our Messengers and the believers in this life and on the day when witness will come forward
The excuses of the unjust will be of no benefit to them on that day
They will be condemned to live in a most terrible abode
To Moses We had given guidance and to the children of Israel We had given the Book
as their inheritance and as a guide and a reminder to the people of understanding
Muhammad exercise patience
The promise of God is true
Seek forgiveness for your sins and glorify your Lord with His praise in the evenings and in the early mornings
Those who dispute the revelations of God without having received any authority do so because of their arrogance but their arrogance cannot bring them any success
Seek protection from God for He is Allhearing and Allaware
The creation of the heavens and the earth is certainly greater than the creation of mankind but most people do not know
Just as the blind and the seeing are not equal so are the righteously striving believers and the sinners are not equal
How little to this you pay attention
The Hour of Doom will inevitably come but most people do not have faith
Your Lord has said Pray to Me for I shall answer you prayers
Those who are too proud to worship Me will soon go to hell in disgrace
It is God Who has made the night for you to rest and the day for you to see
God is Benevolent to the human being but most people do not give Him due thanks
It is God your Lord Who has created all things
He is the only Lord
Why then do you turn away from His worship to the worshipping of idols
Thus are indeed those who have rejected the revelations of God
It is God who has created the earth as a place for you to live and the sky as a dome above you
He has shaped you in the best form and has provided you with pure sustenance This is God your Lord
Blessed is God the Lord of the Universe
He is the Everlasting and the only Lord
So worship Him and be devoted to His religion
It is only God the Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
Muhammad say I have been forbidden to worship whatever you worship besides God after receiving clear evidence from my Lord I have been commanded to submit myself to the will of the Lord of the Universe
It is He Who created you from clay turning it into a living germ then into a clot of blood and then brings you forth as a child
He then made you grow into manhood and become old
He causes some of you to live for the appointed time and some of you to die before so that perhaps you may have understanding
It is He Who gives life and causes things to die
When He decides to do something He only says Exist and it comes into existence
Have you not seen how those who dispute the revelations of God turn away from Truth to falsehood
Those who rejected the Book and the message which was given to Our Messenger will soon know the consequences of their evil deeds
when fetters will be placed around their necks and chains will drag them
into boiling water and then they will be burned in the fire
Then they will be asked Where are the idols which you worshipped besides God
They will reply They have abandoned us
In fact we had worshipped nothing Thus does God cause the disbelievers to go astray
They will be told This torment is the result of your unreasonable happiness on the earth and of your propagation of falsehood
Enter the gates of hell to live therein forever
How terrible is the dwelling of the arrogant ones
Muhammad exercise patience
The promise of God is true
Whether We let you witness the suffering with which they were threatened or because of your death you do not see them suffering We shall still punish them when they return to Us on the Day of Judgment
We have told you the stories of some of Our Messengers whom We had sent before you and We have not told you the stories of some others
A Messenger is not supposed to show a miracle without the permission of God
When God s decree of punishment comes to pass He will judge truthfully and the supporters of the falsehood will perish when God s decree of punishemnt comes to pass
It is God Who has created cattle for you to ride and to consume as food
You may also obtain other benefits from them
You may ride them to seek whatever you need or be carried by them as ships carry you by sea
God shows you the evidence of His existence
How can you then deny such evidence
Have they not travelled through the land to see the terrible end of those who lived before them
They were far mightier in both number and power and in what they had established
Their worldly gains were of no benefit to them
They were far too content with their own knowledge to pay attention to the Messengers when Our Messengers came to them with illustrious evidence
They were encompassed by the torment for mocking Our guidance
They said We believe in One God and disbelieve in whatever we had considered equal to Him when they experienced Our wrath
Their faith proved to be of no benefit to them when they became subject to Our torment
Such was God s prevailing tradition among His servants in the past
Thus were the unbelievers destroyed
Ha Mim
This is the revelations from the Beneficent Merciful God
The verses of this Book have been fully expounded It is a reading in the Arabic language for the people of knowledge
It contains glad news and warnings for the people but most of them have ignored it and do not listen
They say Our hearts are covered against and our ears are deaf to whatever you Muhammad invite us to
There is a barrier between us and you
So act as you please and we shall act as we please
Muhammad say I am a mere mortal like you
I have received a revelation that your Lord is the only One
So be upright and obedient to Him and seek forgiveness from Him
Woe to the pagans who do not pay zakat and have no faith in the life to come
The righteously striving believers will have a neverending reward
Say Do you really disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in two days Do you consider things equal to Him
He is the Lord of the Universe
In four days He placed the mountains on it blessed it and equally measured out sustenance for those who seek sustenance
He established His dominance over the sky which for that time was like smoke
Then He told the heavens and the earth Take your shape either willingly or by force They said We willingly obey
He formed the seven heavens in two days and revealed to each one its task
He decked the sky above the earth with torches and protected it from intruders
Such is the design of the Majestic and Allknowing God
If they ignore your message tell them I have warned you against a destructive blast of sound like that which struck the people of Ad and Thamud
When Messengers from all sides came to them saying Do not worship anything besides God they said Had our Lord wanted He would have sent us angelic Messengers
We do not believe in your message
The people of Ad unjustly sought dominance on earth saying Who is more powerful than us
Did they not consider that God created them and that He is more powerful than they were
They rejected Our revelations
We sent upon them a violent wind during a few illfated days to make them suffer a disgraceful torment in this life
Their torment in the life to come will be even more disgraceful and they will not receive any help
We sent guidance to the people of Thamud but they preferred blindness to guidance so a humiliating blast of torment struck them for their evil deeds
We only rescued the believers who had fear of God
They will be spurred on
until on the brink of it their eyes ears and skin will testify to their deeds on the Day when the enemies of God are driven to the fire
They will ask their own skin Why did you testify against us
They will reply God who has made everything speak made us also speak
It was He Who created you in the first place and to Him you have returned
You did not think to hide your deeds from your ears eyes and skin and you felt that God would not know all that you had been doing
This was how you considered your Lord but He knows you better than you know yourselves Thus you are now lost
Even if they were to exercise patience their dwelling would still be hell fire
Even if they were to seek favors they would receive none
We assigned for them companions who would make their past and present deeds seem attractive to them
Thus they became subject to what the jinn and human beings before were destined to suffer
They were certainly lost
The disbelievers say Do not listen to this Quran but make a lot of unnecessary noise while it is being read so that perhaps you will defeat it
We shall certainly make the unbelievers suffer severe torment and will punish them far worse than what they deserve for their deeds
The recompense of the enemies of God for their rejection of Our revelations will be fire as their eternal dwelling
The disbelievers will say Lord show us the human beings and jinn who caused us to go astray We shall put them under our feet to lower them
To those who have said God is our Lord and who have remained steadfast to their belief the angels will descend saying Do not be afraid or grieved
Receive the glad news of the Paradise which was promised to you
We are your guardians in this world and in the life to come where you will have whatever you call for
a hospitable welcome from the Allforgiving and Allmerciful God
Who speaks better than one who invites human beings to God acts righteously and says I am a Muslim
Virtue and evil are not equal If you replace evil habits by virtuous ones you will certainly find that your enemies will become your intimate friends
Only those who exercise patience and who have been granted a great share of God s favor can find such an opportunity
Muhammad seek God s protection if satan s temptation grieves you for God is Allhearing and Allknowing
Some evidence of His existence are the night day sun and moon
Do not prostrate before the sun and the moon but prostrate before God Who has created them if you want to worship Him alone
However if people are too proud to prostrate before God let them know that God s other creatures glorify Him both day and night without fatigue
Further evidence is that at times you find the earth to be barren
When it is watered it moves and swells to let the plants grow
The One who brings it back to life will also bring the dead back to life
He has power over all things
Those who deviate from Our revelations are not hidden from Us
Is the one who will be thrown into hell fire better than the one who will be brought safely into the presence of God on the Day of Judgment
Act as you wish God is WellAware of whatever you do
The disbelievers do not know that the Quran which was sent to them is certainly a glorious Book
Falsehood can not reach it from any direction
It is the revelation from the Allwise Praiseworthy One
Nothing has been said to you which was not said to the Messengers who lived before you
Your Lord is certainly Allforgiving but stern in His retribution
Had We sent down this Quran in a nonArabic language they would have said Why have its verses not been well expounded
Could a nonArabic Book be revealed to an Arabic speaking person
Muhammad say It is a guide and a cure for the believers
As for those who do not believe they are deaf and blind
It is as though they had been called from a distant place
We had given the Book to Moses about which people greatly disagreed
Had the word of your Lord not been decreed He would have certainly settled their differences there and then
They were greatly suspicious and doubtful about the Book of Moses
Whoever acts righteously does so for his own good and whoever commits evil does so against his soul
Your Lord is not unjust to His servants
It is He who has the knowledge of the Hour of Doom and the fruits that will come out of their covering He knows what the females conceive and deliver
On the day when the unbelievers will be asked Where are the idols which you considered equal to God they will reply We declare that none of us have seen them
Whatever they had worshipped before will disappear and they will then know that there is no way for them to escape
The human being never tires of asking for good but if he is afflicted by hardship he despairs and gives up all hope
When We grant him mercy after his suffering he boldly says This is what I deserved
I do not think that there will ever be a Day of Judgment
Even if I will be returned to my Lord I shall still deserve to receive better rewards from Him
We shall certainly tell the unbelievers about their deeds and cause them to suffer a severe punishment
When We grant the human being a favor he ignores it and turns away but when he is afflicted by hardship he starts lengthy prayers
Say Think if the Quran is from God and you have rejected it then who has gone farther astray than the one who has wandered far from the truth
We shall continue to show them Our evidence in the world and within their souls until it becomes clear that the Quran is the truth
Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord witness all things
They are certainly doubtful about their meeting with their Lord
God indeed encompasses all things
Ha Mim
Sin Qaf
Muhammad this is how God the Majestic and Allwise sends revelations to you and sent them to those who lived before you
To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth
He is the Most High and the Most Great
When the revelation passes through the heavens they almost break apart
At that time the angels glorify their Lord with His praise and seek forgiveness for those who live on earth
God is certainly Allforgiving and Allmerciful
God is the guardian of even those who have chosen others idols besides Him as their guardians Muhammad you will not have to answer for them
We have revealed the Quran to you in the Arabic language so that you could warn the people of the Mother Town Mecca and those around it of the inevitable Day of Resurrection when some will go to Paradise and others to hell
Had God wanted He could have made them all one single nation but He grants mercy to whomever He wills
The unjust will have no guardian or helper
Have they chosen other guardians besides Him
God is the real Guardian and it is He who will bring the dead back to life
He has power over all things
Whatever differences you may have about the Quran the final decision rests with God
In Him do I trust and to Him do I turn in repentance
He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth He has made you and the cattle in pairs and has multiplied you by His creation
There is certainly nothing like Him
He is Allhearing and Allaware
In His hands are the keys of the heavens and the earth
He increases and determines the sustenance of whomever He wants
He has the knowledge of all things
He has plainly clarified the religion which is revealed to you and that which Noah Abraham Moses and Jesus were commanded to follow He has explained it so that you would be steadfast and united in your religion
What you call the pagans to is extremely grave for them
God attracts to the religion whomever He wants and guides to it whoever turns to Him in repentance
Only after receiving the knowledge did people divide themselves into different groups because of rebellion among themselves
Had it not been for your Lord s giving them respite for an appointed time He would certainly have settled their differences once and for all
Those who inherited the Book from their quarrelsome predecessors also have doubts and suspicions about it
Thus Muhammad preach My revelation to the people and be steadfast in your faith as you have been commanded
Do not follow their desires but say I believe in the Book which God has sent down and I have been commanded to exercise justice among you
God is our Lord and your Lord
Each of us will be responsible for his own deeds
Let there be no disputes among us
God will bring us all together and to Him we shall all return
The disputes of those who quarrel about God after pledging obedience to Him will be void in the eyes of their Lord
Such people will be subject to His wrath and will suffer a severe torment
It is God who revealed the Book and the Balance for a truthful purpose You never know
Perhaps the Hour of Doom is close at hand
The disbelievers want you to show them the Day of Judgment immediately while the believers are afraid of it for they know it to be the truth
Those who insist on disputing the Hour of Doom are certainly in plain error
God is kind to His servants He gives sustenance to whomever He wants
He is Allpowerful and Majestic
We shall increase the harvest of those who seek a good harvest in the life hereafter However those who want to have their harvest in this life will be given it but will have no share in the hereafter
Do they have idols who have established a religion without the permission of God
Had not it been for your Lord s giving them respite for an appointed time He would certainly have settled their differences once and for all
The unjust will certainly suffer a painful torment
You can see that the unjust are afraid of the consequences of their deeds which will inevitably strike them
However the righteously striving believers will live in the gardens wherein they will have whatever they want from their Lord
This is certainly the greatest reward
This is the glad news which God gives to His servants the righteously striving believers
Muhammad say I do not ask you for any payment for my preaching to you except your love of my near relatives
Whoever achieves virtue will have its merit increased
God is Allforgiving and Appreciating
Do they say that he Muhammad has invented falsehood against God
Had God wanted He could have sealed up your heart
God causes falsehood to vanish and by His words firmly establishes the truth
He has full knowledge of what the hearts contain
It is He who accepts the repentance of His servants forgives their evil deeds and knows all about what you do
He answers the prayers of the righteously striving believers and grants them increasing favors
The unbelievers will suffer a severe punishment
Had God given abundant sustenance to His servants they would have certainly rebelled on earth but He sends them a known measure of sustenance as He wills He is Allaware of His servants and watches over them all
It is He who sends down the rain after they had lost hope and spreads out His mercy
He is the Guardian and the Most Praiseworthy
Some of the evidence of His existence are His creation of the heavens and the earth and the beasts which inhabit it
He has all the power to bring them together if He wishes this to be so
Whatever hardship befalls you is the result of your own deeds
God pardons many of your sins
You cannot challenge God on earth and you will have no one besides Him as your guardian or helper
Further evidence of His existence are the ships which stand as mountains in the sea
Had He wanted He could have stopped the wind and let the ships remain motionless on the surface of the sea in this there is evidence of the Truth for all those who are patient and grateful
or He could have destroyed them as punishment for the human being s deeds However God pardons many sins
He knows all those who dispute His revelations They will find no way to escape from His torment
Whatever you have received is just a means of enjoyment for this life but the reward of God for the believers and those who trust in their Lord will be better and everlasting
This reward will be for those who keep away from major sins and indecency who forgive when they are made angry
who have pledged their obedience to the Lord who are steadfast in prayer who conduct their affairs with consultation among themselves who spend for the cause of God out of what We have given them
and those who when suffering a great injustice seek to defend themselves
The recompense for evil will be equivalent to the deed
He who pardons the evil done to him and reforms himself will receive his reward from God
God certainly does not love the unjust
Those who successfully defend themselves after being wronged will not be questioned
Only those who do injustice to people and commit rebellion on earth for no reason will be questioned
They will suffer a painful torment
To exercise patience and forgive the wrong done to one is the proof of genuine determination
Whomever God has caused to go astray will find no guardian after this
You will see the unjust on facing the torment say Is there any way to turn back
You will see them exposed to the fire subdued in humiliation looking sideways at it pleadingly
However at the same time the believers will say The true losers are those who will lose their souls and families on the Day of Judgment
The unjust will certainly suffer everlasting torment
They will have no guardian or helper besides God
Whoever God has caused to go astray will never find the right direction
Pledge obedience to your Lord before the coming of the inevitable Day when you will find no refuge to escape from God s wrath and no one to defend you
Muhammad if they turn away from your message know that We have not sent you as their keeper
Your duty is only to deliver the message
When We grant mercy to the human being he becomes joyous but when he is afflicted by evil as a result of his own deeds he proves to be ungrateful
To God belongs the heavens and the earth
He created whatever He wanted He grants males female or pairs of
offspring to whomever He wants He causes whomever He wants to be childless
He is AllKnowing and AllPowerful
To no mortal does God speak but through revelation from behind a curtain or by sending a Messenger who reveals by His permission whatever He pleases He is the Most High and the Allwise
Thus We have revealed a Spirit to you Muhammad by Our command
Before you did not even know what a Book or Faith was but We have made the Quran as a light by which We guide whichever of Our servants We want
You certainly guide people to the right path
the path of God who is the owner of all that is in the heavens and the earth
To God certainly do all matters return
Ha Mim
I swear by the illustrious Book
We have made it an Arabic reading text so that perhaps you may understand
It the Quran exists in the original Book with Us which is certainly Most Exalted full of wisdom and beyond linguistic structures
Can We ignore sending you the Quran just because you are a transgressing people
How many Messengers did We send to the ancient people
No Prophet came to them whom they did not mock
We destroyed the strongest among them in power
The stories of the ancient people have already been mentioned
Muhammad if you ask them Who has created the heavens and the earth They will certainly say The Majestic and Allknowing God has created them
It is He who has made the earth for you as a cradle and has made roads therein so that you will perhaps seek guidance
It is He who has sent down water from the sky in a known measure by which He has given life to the dead earth
In the same way will you also be resurrected
It is He who has created everything in pairs and the ships and cattle for you to ride
so that perhaps when you ride them you will recall the bounties of your Lord and when you establish your control over it you would say Glory belongs to Him who has made it subservient to us when we would not have been able to do so ourselves
To our Lord we shall all return
The pagans have considered some of His servants as His children
There is no doubt that the human being is simply ungrateful
Has God chosen some of His own creatures as daughters for Himself and has given you the preference of having sons
When one of them is given the glad news of the birth of a daughter which they believe to be the only kind of child that the Beneficent God can have his face blackens with anger
Does God choose for Himself the kind of children who grow up wearing ornaments and who are not strong enough to defend their rights
Do they say that the angels who are the servants of the Beneficent God are females
Have they witnessed their creation
Their words as such will be recorded and they will be questioned for it
The pagans say Had the Beneficent God wanted we would not have worshipped them idols
Whatever they say is not based on knowledge
It is only a false conjecture
Had We before sending the Quran given them a book to which they now refer as an authority
In fact they say We found our fathers following a certain belief and we now follow in their footsteps for our guidance
In the same way whenever We had sent a Messenger before you to warn a town the rich ones therein said We found our fathers following a certain belief and we follow in their footsteps
The Messengers would say Would you still follow in the footsteps of your fathers even if I was to bring you better guidance
They would say We have no faith in your message
We took revenge on them
See how terrible the end of those who rejected Or revelations was
When Abraham said to his father and his people I boldly renounce what you worship
except for the One who has created me and will guide me
God made belief in one God an everlasting task for his successors so that perhaps they would return to Him
In fact We allowed them and their fathers to enjoy themselves until the truth and a strong Messenger came to them
When the truth came to them they said This is magic and we have no faith in it
Then they said Why this Quran had not been revealed to a man from either of the two great towns
Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord
It is We who have distributed their sustenance in this world and raised the positions of some of them above the others so that they would mock each other
The mercy of your Lord is better than what they can amass
Were it not for the fear that all people would become one in disbelief We would have made for the disbelievers in the Beneficent God ceilings out of silver and ladders by which they would climb up
doors for their houses couches on which to recline
and other ornament of gold
All these are only the means of enjoyment in this world but the pious will receive their reward from your Lord in the life hereafter
We shall make satan the companion of whoever ignores the remembrance of the Beneficent God
Satan will prevent them from the right path while they think that they have the right guidance
When he returns to us he will say to satan Would that there had been as long a distance between me and you as that between the East and West
What a terrible companion you have been
They will be told on the Day of Judgment Regret will never be of any benefit to you
You have done injustice to your souls and you will share the torment
Muhammad can you make the deaf hear or guide the blind or the one who is clearly in error
We shall revenge them either after your death
or show them to you suffering the torment with which We had threatened them
We are certainly dominant over them all
Follow devotedly that which is revealed to you
You are certainly on the right path
The Quran is a reminder to you and to your people and you will soon be questioned about it
You can ask Our Messengers whom We sent before you if We had commanded them to worship other gods besides the Beneficent God
We sent Moses to the Pharaoh and his nobles with Our miracles and he said I am the Messenger of the Lord of the Universe
When he showed them Our miracles they started to laugh at them
Of all the miracles which We showed to them the latter ones were greater than the former We struck them with torment so that perhaps they would return to Us
They said Magician pray to your Lord for us through your covenant with Him If he saves us from the torment we shall certainly seek guidance
When We relieved them from the torment they suddenly turned back on their heels
The Pharaoh shouted to his people My people is the kingdom of Egypt not mine and can you not see that the streams flow from beneath my palace
Am I not better than this lowly man who can barely express himself
Why have bracelets of gold not been given to him and why have some angels not accompanied him
Thus he made dimwits out of his people and they followed him They certainly were a sinful people
When they invoked Our anger
We took revenge on them by drowning them all together
We made them become of the people of the past and an example for the coming generations
When the son of Mary was mentioned as an example you people cried out in protest saying
Are our gods any better than Jesus for according to Muhammad if our gods go to hell so too will Jesus What they say is only a false argument
In fact they are a quarrelsome people
Jesus was a servant of Ours to whom We had granted favors and whom We made as an example for the Israelites
Had We wanted We could have made the angels as your successors on the earth
Muhammad tell them Jesus is a sign of the Hour of Doom
Have no doubt about it and follow me this is the straight path
Let satan not prevent you from the right path
He is your sworn enemy
When Jesus came with clear proof in support of his truthfulness he said I have come to you with wisdom to clarify for you some of the matters in which you have disputes
Have fear of God and obey me
God is your Lord and my Lord so worship Him
This is the right path
But certain groups created differences among themselves Woe to the unjust
They will face a painful torment
Are they waiting for the Hour of Doom when the torment will suddenly strike them and they will not even realize from where it came
All intimate friends on that day will become each others enemies except for the pious
whom God will tell My servants you need have no fear on this day nor will you be grieved
Those who have faith in Our revelations and have submitted themselves to Our will
will be told Enter Paradise with your spouses in delight
Golden dishes and cups will be passed among them
All that the souls may desire and that may delight their eyes will be available therein
You will live therein forever
This is the Paradise which you have received as your inheritance by virtue of what you have done
You will have abundant fruits therein to consume
The criminals will live forever in the torment of hell Their torment will not be relieved and they will despair of escaping
We had not done any injustice to them but they had wronged themselves
They will cry out Guard let your Lord destroy us
The angelic guard will say You will have to stay
We brought you the truth but most of you disliked it
If the disbelievers persist in their disbelief We shall also persist in punishing them
Do they think that We do not hear their secrets and whispers
We certainly can hear them and Our Messengers record it all
Muhammad say Had the Beneficent God really had a son I would certainly have been the first one to worship him
The Lord of the heavens and the earth and the Throne is too glorious to be described in the way they describe Him
Leave them to indulge in their desires and play around until they face that day which has been promised to them
It is God who is the Lord of the heavens and is the Lord on earth
He is Allwise and Allknowing
Blessed is He to whom belongs the heavens the earth and all that is between them and who has the knowledge of the Hour of Doom
To Him you will all return
Those whom they worship besides God are not able to intercede except for those among them who believe in the Truth God and who know whom to intercede for
Muhammad if you ask them Who had created the idols They will certainly say God has created them
Why do you then turn away from God
God has knowledge of Muhammad s words when he complains to Him My Lord these my people do not believe
We have told him Ignore them and say to them farewell
They will soon know the consequences of their deeds
Ha Mim
I swear by the illustrious Book
that We have revealed the Quran on a blessed night to warn mankind
On this night every absolute command coming from Us becomes distinguishable
The command that We have been sending
as a mercy for the human being from your Lord
Your Lord is Allhearing and Allknowing
He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if only you would have strong faith
There is only One Lord
It is He who gives life and causes things to die
He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
In fact the unbelievers have doubts because of excessive involvement in worldly affairs
Wait for the day which will come before the Day of Judgment when the sky will give out dense smoke
which will smother the people
They will say This is a painful torment
Lord remove this torment from us for we are believers
How could this punishment bring them to their senses when a Messenger evidently had come to them
and they turned away saying He is a trained and insane person
We shall remove the torment for a while but you will revert to your old ways
However We shall truly take Our revenge on the day when the great seizure takes place
We had certainly tested the people of the Pharaoh before them to whom a noble Messengers had come saying
Send the servants of God with me
I am a trustworthy Messenger sent to you
Do not consider yourselves above God
I shall show you a manifest authority in support of my truthfulness
I seek protection from my Lord and your Lord from your decision of stoning me
If you do not want to believe leave me alone
Moses addressed his Lord saying Lord these people are sinners
We told him Leave the city with My servants during the night
You will be pursued
Cross the sea by cutting a path through it
Pharaoh s army will be drowned
How many were the gardens springs
cornfields gracious mansions
and other bounties which they enjoyed yet left behind
We gave these as an inheritance to other people
The sky nor the earth cried for them nor were they given respite
We rescued the Israelites from the humiliating torment
and from the Pharaoh
He was the chief of the transgressors
We gave preference to the Israelites over the other people with Our knowledge
and sent them revelations of which some were a clear trial for them
These people say
After we die we shall never be raised to life again
Bring back to life our fathers if what you say is true
Are they better than the tribe of Tubba name of a Yemenite tribal chief and those who lived before them
We destroyed them
They were criminals
We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for Our own amusement
We have created them for a genuine purpose but most people do not know
The appointed time for all of them will be the Day of Judgment
when wrong will be distinguished from right
On this day friends will be of no benefit to one another nor will they receive any help
except for those to whom God grants mercy
He is Majestic and Allmerciful
The tree of Zaqqum
is food for the sinner
It will be like molted brass which will boil in the bellies
like water
It will be said of such sinners Seize them and drag them into the middle of hell
Then pour unto their heads the boiling water to torment them
They will be told Suffer the torment
You had thought yourselves to be majestic and honorable
This is the torment that you persistently doubted
The pious ones will be in a secure place
amid gardens and springs
clothed in fine silk and rich brocade sitting face to face with one another
We shall unite them to maidens with big black and white lovely eyes
They will be offered all kinds of fruits in peace and security
They will not experience any death other than that which they have already been through
God will protect them from the torment of hell as a favor from your Lord
Muhammad this is certainly the greatest triumph
We have made the Quran easy for you to recite so that perhaps they may take heed
Wait for God s decree and they too will be waiting
Ha Mim
This Book is revealed from God the Majestic and Allwise
In the heavens and the earth there is evidence of the Truth for the believers
In your creation and in that of the beasts living on earth there is evidence of the Truth for the people who have strong faith
In the alternation of the night and the day the sustenance which God has sent down from the sky to revive the barren earth and in the changing of the direction of the winds there is evidence of the truth for the people of understanding
These are the revelations of God which We recite to you for a genuine purpose
In what statements other than God s and His revelations will they then believe
Woe to every sinful liar
He hears the revelations of God which are recited to him then persists in his arrogance as if he had not even heard them
Tell him that he will suffer a painful torment
When he learns about some of Our revelations he mocks them
Such people will suffer a humiliating torment
Hell is awaiting them and none of their deeds will be of any benefit to them nor will any guardian whom they have chosen besides God
They will suffer a great torment
This Quran is a guidance
Those who reject the revelations of their Lord will suffer the most painful punishment
God has made the sea subservient to you so that ships sail on by His command and you seek His favors
Perhaps you will be grateful
He has also made subservient to you all that is in the heavens and the earth
In this there is evidence of the Truth for those who use their minds
Tell the believers to forgive those who do not have faith in the days of God Day of Judgment and Resurrection
God will give due recompense to all the people for their deeds
One who acts righteously does so for his own benefit and one who commits evil does so against his own soul
To your Lord you will all return
We gave the Book to the Israelites the commandments and prophethood granted them pure sustenance and gave them preference above all people
We also gave them clear evidence in support of the true religion
Only after having received knowledge did they create differences among themselves because of their rebelliousness
Your Lord will issue His decree concerning their differences on the Day of Judgment
We have established for you a code of conduct and a religion
Follow it and do not follow the desires of the ignorant people
They will never be sufficient protection for you in place of God
The unjust are each other s friends but God is the guardian of the pious ones
This Quran is an enlightenment for the people and a guide and mercy for the people who have strong faith
Do the people who commit evil think that We shall make their life and death like that of the righteously striving believers How terrible is their Judgment
God has created the heavens and the earth for a genuine purpose so that every soul will be duly recompensed for its deeds without being wronged
Have you seen the one who has chosen his desires as his lord
God has knowingly caused him to go astray sealed his ears and heart and veiled his vision
Who besides God can guide him
Will they then not take heed
They have said The only life is this worldly life and here we shall live and die
It is only time which will destroy us They have no knowledge about this
It is only their guesswork
When Our enlightening revelations are recited to them their only argument against it is Bring our forefathers back to life if what you say is true
Muhammad say It is God who gives you life and causes you to die
He will bring you together on the inevitable Day of Judgment but most people do not know
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth
On the day when the Hour of Doom arrives the followers of falsehood will be lost
You will see all the people kneeling down
Everyone will be summoned to the Book containing the record of their deeds
They will be told On this day you will be recompensed for what you have done
This is Our Book
It will tell you the truth
We have made a copy of all that you have done
The Lord will admit the righteously striving believing people into His mercy
This is certainly a clear victory
To the unbelievers the Lord will say Were not Our revelations recited to you and did not you arrogantly reject them You were a sinful people
When it was said that the promise of God is true and that the Hour would inevitably come you said We do not know what the Hour of Doom is we are suspicious about it and we are not convinced
Their evil deeds will be revealed to them and the torment which they had mocked will surround them
They will be told On this day We shall forget you in the same way that you had forgotten your coming into Our presence
Your dwelling will be hell fire and no one will help you
This is only because you had mocked the revelations of God and the worldly life had deceived you
On this day they will not be taken out of hell nor will they be granted any favors
It is only God Lord of the heavens and the earth and Lord of the Universe who deserves all praise
It is His greatness that dominates the heavens and the earth
He is the Majestic and Allwise
Ha Mim
This Book is revealed from God the Majestic and Allwise
We have created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them ONLY for a genuine purpose and an appointed time
The unbelievers ignore that of which they have been warned
Muhammad ask them Have you thought about what you worship besides God Show me which part of the earth they have created
Do they have a share in the creation of the heavens
Bring me a Book revealed before this Quran or any other proof based on knowledge to support your belief if indeed you are truthful
Who is more astray than one who prays to things besides God things that would not be able to answer his prayers even if he would wait till the Day of Judgment They are not even aware of his prayers
When people will be resurrected such gods will become their enemies and will reject their worship
When Our enlightening revelations are recited to them the disbelievers of the truth which has come to them say This is plain magic
They say Muhammad has invented it Quran by himself
Say Had I invented it you would not have been able to rescue me from God
He knows best what you say about it
He is our witness and He is Allforgiving and Allmerciful
Say I am not the first Messenger
I do not know what will be done to me or to you
I follow only what has been revealed to me and my duty is only to give clear warning
Say What do you think will happen if this Quran is from God and you have rejected it Besides a witness from among the Israelites has testified to the divinity of a Book like it and believed in it Quran while you have arrogantly denied it
God does not guide the unjust
The disbelievers have said about the believers Had there been anything good in it Quran they could not have accepted it before us Since they do not benefit from its guidance they say It Quran is only a fabricated legend
Before this Quran the Book of Moses was a guide and a blessing
This Book confirms the Torah It is in the Arabic language so that it may warn the unjust people and give glad news to the righteous ones
Those who have said Our Lord is God and are steadfast in their belief need have no fear or be grieved
They will be the dwellers of Paradise wherein they will live forever as a reward for what they have done
We have advised the human being to be kind to his parents his mother bore him with hardship and delivered him while suffering a great deal of pain
The period in which his mother bore and weaned him lasted for thirty months
When he grewup to manhood and became forty years old he then said Lord inspire me to give You thanks for the bounties you have granted to me and my parents and to act righteously to please You
Lord make my offspring virtuous
Lord I turn to you in repentance I am a Muslim
These are the ones from whom We accept righteous deeds and ignore their bad deeds They will be among the dwellers of Paradise
There are people who say to their parents Fie upon you
Are you telling us that we shall be raised from our graves So many people have died before us and none of them have been raised Their parents plead to God and say to their child Woe to you
Have faith the promise of God is certainly true They reply What you say is only ancient legends
Such people will be subject to the punishment of God which was also decreed for many human beings and jinn before them
These people are certainly lost
Everyone will have a position proportionate to the degree of his deeds Finally God will recompense them for their deeds and they will not be wronged
On the day when the disbelievers will be exposed to the fire they will be told You have spent your happy days during your worldly life and enjoyed them On this day you will suffer a humiliating torment for your unreasonably arrogant manners on earth and for the evil deeds which you have committed
Muhammad recall the brother of the people of Ad when he warned his people in the valley of alahqaf saying There existed many warners before and after him Do not worship anything other than God
I am afraid for you about the torment of the great Day
They said Have you come to turn us away from our gods
Show us that with which you threaten us if you are truthful
He said Only God has the knowledge of the coming of such torment
I preach to you the message that I have brought but I can see that you are an ignorant people
When they saw the torment as a cloud proceeding to their valleys they said This cloud will bring us rain
He said No it is the torment which you wanted to suffer immediately It is a wind bearing and painful torment
It will destroy everything by the will of its Lord Not very long after nothing could be seen of them except their dwellings
Thus do We recompense the sinful people
And if he is one of the People on the Right
he will be welcomed by the words “ Peace to you ” from the People on the Right
And if he is one of those who give the lie to this Message and go astray
then he will be served boiling water
and will be scorched by the Fire
That indeed is the absolute truth
So glorify the name of your Great Lord
All that is in the heavens and the earth extols the glory of Allah
He is the Most Mighty the Most Wise
His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth
He gives life and causes death and He has power over everything
He is the First and the Last and the Manifest and the Hidden and He has knowledge of everything
He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself on the Throne
He knows all that enters the earth and all that comes forth from it and all that comes down from the heaven and all that goes up to it
He is with you wherever you are
Allah sees all that you do
His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and to Him are all matters referred for judgement
He causes the night to pass into the day and causes the day to pass into the night and He fully knows all that is hidden in the breasts of people
Believe in Allah and in His Messenger and expend of what He has entrusted to you
A great reward awaits those of you who believe and spend their wealth
How is it that you do not believe in Allah when the Messenger calls you to believe in your Lord and although he has taken a covenant from you if indeed you are believers
He it is Who sends down Clear Signs to His servant so as to bring you out from darkness into light
Surely Allah is Most Kind and Most Compassionate to you
How is it that you do not expend in the Way of Allah when to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth
Those who spent their wealth and took part in fighting before the Victory cannot be equated with those who spent their wealth and took part in fighting afterwards
They are higher in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards
But to each Allah has promised a good reward
Allah is well aware of all that you do
Who is it that will give Allah a beautiful loan A loan that Allah will repay after increasing it many times and grant him a generous reward
On that Day you will see believing men and women that their light will be running before them and on their right hands
They will be told “ A good tiding to you today ”
There shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow therein they shall abide
That indeed is the great triumph
On that Day the hypocrites both men and women shall say to the believers “ Look at us that we may extract some light from your light ”
They will be told “ Go back and seek light for yourselves elsewhere ”
Then a wall shall be erected between them with a door in it On the inside of it there will be mercy and on the outside of it there will be chastisement
The hypocrites will call out to the believers “ Were we not with you ”
The believers will reply “ Yes but you allowed yourselves to succumb to temptations and you wavered and you remained in doubt and false expectations deluded you until Allah s command came to pass and the Deluder deluded you concerning Allah
So no ransom shall be accepted from you today nor from those who disbelieved
You are destined for the Fire
That will be your guardian
And that indeed is a grievous destination
Is the time not come that the hearts of the believers should be humbled to Allah s remembrance and to the Truth that He has revealed and that they should not be like those who were vouchsafed the Book and then a long time elapsed so that their hearts were hardened A great many of them are now evildoers
Know well that Allah revives the earth after it becomes lifeless
We have clearly shown Our Signs to you perchance you will use your reason
Verily those who give alms be they men or women and give Allah a beautiful loan shall be repaid after increasing it many times and theirs shall be a generous reward
In Allah s sight only those who truly believe in Allah and His Messengers are utterly truthful and true bearers of witness for the sake of Allah
For them is their reward and their light
As for those who gave the lie to Our Signs they are the people of Hell
Know well that the life of this world is merely sport and diversion and adornment and an object of your boasting with one another and a rivalry in the multiplication of riches and children
Its likeness is that of rain when it produces vegetation it delights the tillers
But then it withers and you see it turn yellow and then it crumbles away
In the Hereafter there is either grievous chastisement or forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure
The life of this world is nothing but delusion
So vie with one another in seeking to attain your Lord s forgiveness and a Garden whose width is as the width of the heaven and the earth one which has been prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers
That is Allah s bounty which He bestows upon those whom He pleases
Allah is the Lord of abounding bounty
No misfortune ever befalls on earth nor on yourselves but We have inscribed it in the Book before We make it manifest
Surely that is easy for Allah
We do so that you may not grieve over the loss you suffer nor exult over what He gave you
Allah does not love the vainglorious the boastful
those who are niggardly and bid others to be niggardly
And he who turns away should know that Allah is SelfSufficient Immensely Praiseworthy
Indeed We sent Our Messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance that people may uphold justice
And We sent down iron wherein there is awesome power and many benefits for people so that Allah may know who without even having seen Him helps Him and His Messengers
Surely Allah is Most Strong Most Mighty
Indeed We sent forth Noah and Abraham and established in their line Prophecy and the Book
Then some of them embraced the guidance and many of them are wicked
In their wake We sent a succession of Our Messengers and raised Jesus son of Mary after all of them and bestowed upon him the Evangel and We set tenderness and mercy in the hearts of those that followed him
As for monasticism it is they who invented it We did not prescribe it for them
They themselves invented it in pursuit of Allah s good pleasure and then they did not observe it as it ought to have been observed
So We gave their reward to those of them that believed
But many of them are wicked
Believers have fear of Allah and believe in His Messenger and He will grant you a twofold portion of His Mercy and will appoint for you a light whereby you shall walk and He will forgive you
Allah is Most Forgiving Most Compassionate
You should do this so that the People of the Book know that they have no control over Allah s Bounty and that all bounty is in Allah s Hand He bestows it on whomsoever He pleases
Allah is the Lord of abounding bounty
Allah has surely heard the words of her who contends with you concerning her husband and complains to Allah
Allah hears what both of you say
Verily Allah is All Hearing AllSeeing
Those among you who divorce their wives by declaring them to be their mothers such are not their mothers none are their mothers except those who gave birth to them
Indeed what they say is highly contemptible and false
Verily Allah is Most Pardoning Most Forgiving
Those who declare their wives to be their mothers and thereafter go back on what they have said shall free a slave before they may touch each other
That is what you are exhorted to do
Allah is fully aware of all your deeds
And he who does not find a slave to free shall fast for two months consecutively before they may touch each other and he who is unable to do so shall feed sixty needy people
All this is in order that you may truly believe in Allah and His Messenger
These are the bounds set by Allah and a grievous chastisement awaits the unbelievers
Verily those who oppose Allah and His Messenger shall be brought low even as those before them were brought low
Surely We have sent down Clear Signs and a humiliating chastisement awaits the unbelievers
a chastisement that shall come upon them on the Day when Allah will raise them all to a new life and will inform them of their deeds
Allah has recorded it all while they have forgotten it
Allah is a witness over everything
Are you not aware that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth
Never is there any whispering among three but He is their fourth nor among five but He is their sixth nor fewer nor more but He is with them wherever they may be
And then He will tell them on the Day of Judgement all that they have done
Surely Allah knows everything
Have you not seen those who were forbidden to whisper and yet they engaged in what they had been forbidden They secretly converse among themselves concerning sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger
And when they come to you they greet you in a manner that Allah does not greet you and say to themselves “ Why does Allah not chastise us for these utterances of ours ”
Hell it is that shall suffice them and in it will they burn
How woeful is their destination
Believers when you converse in secrecy let that not be concerning sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger rather converse concerning virtue and piety
And fear Allah to Whom all of you shall be mustered
Whispering is an act of Satan one that aims at causing grief to the believers yet without Allah s leave no harm can be caused to them
So in Allah should the believers put all their trust
Believers when you are told “ Make room for one another in your assemblies ” then make room Allah will bestow amplitude on you
And when it is said “ Rise up ” then rise up Allah will raise to high ranks those of you who believe and are endowed with knowledge
Allah is well aware of all that you do
Believers when you come to the Messenger for private consultation offer some charity before your consultation with him
That is better for you and more conducive to purity
But if you find nothing to offer in charity then know that Allah is Most Merciful Most Compassionate
Are you afraid that you will have to offer charity when you hold private conversation with the Prophet
But if you are unable to do so and Allah pardons you then establish Prayer and pay Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger
Allah is well aware of all that you do
Do you not see those who took for friends a people whom Allah is wroth with
They neither belong to you nor you to them
They swear to a falsehood and they do so knowingly
Allah has prepared for them a grievous chastisement
Indeed evil are the acts in which they are engaged
They have taken their oaths as a shield by means of which they hinder people from the Way of Allah
Theirs shall be a humiliating chastisement
Neither their possessions nor their offspring will be of any avail to them against Allah
They are the people of the Fire therein they shall abide
On the Day when Allah will raise them all from the dead they will swear before Him as they swear before you today thinking that this will avail them
Behold they are utter liars
Satan has gained mastery over them and has made them neglect remembering Allah
They are the party of Satan
Behold the party of Satan will be the losers
Verily those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be among the most abject beings
Allah has written “ Surely I will prevail I and My Messengers ”
Verily Allah is Most Strong Most Mighty
You shall not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day befriending those who oppose Allah and His Messenger even though they be their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred
He has inscribed faith in their hearts and has strengthened them with a spirit from Him and He shall make them enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow
Therein they shall abide
Allah is wellpleased with them and they are wellpleased with Him
They belong to Allah s party
Verily Allah s party shall prosper
All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols Allah s Glory He is the Most Mighty the Most Wise
He it is Who in the first assault drove forth the People of the Book that disbelieved from their homes at the first gathering of forces
You did not believe that they would leave while they too thought that their fortresses would defend them against Allah
Then Allah came upon them from whence they did not even imagine casting such terror into their hearts that they destroyed their homes by their own hands and their destruction was also caused by the hands of the believers
So learn a lesson from this O you who have perceptive eyes
If Allah had not decreed banishment for them He would certainly have chastised them in this world
As for the Hereafter the chastisement of the Fire awaits them
That is because they set themselves against Allah and His Messenger and whoever sets himself against Allah should know that Allah is surely Most Stern in retribution
The palmtrees that you cut down or those that you left standing on their roots it was by Allah s leave that you did so Allah granted you this leave in order that He might humiliate the evildoers
Whatever Allah has taken away from them and bestowed as spoils on His Messenger for which you spurred neither horses nor camels but Allah grants authority to His Messengers over whomsoever He pleases
Allah has power over everything
Whatever from the possessions of the towns people Allah has bestowed on His Messenger belongs to Allah and to the Messenger and to his kinsfolk and to the orphans and to the needy and to the wayfarer so that it may not merely circulate between the rich among you
So accept whatever the Messenger gives you and refrain from whatever he forbids you
And fear Allah verily Allah is Most Stern in retribution
It also belongs to the poor Emigrants who have been driven out of their homes and their possessions those who seek Allah s favour and good pleasure and help Allah and His Messenger
Such are the truthful ones
It also belongs to those who were already settled in this abode of Hijrah having come to faith before the arrival of the Muhajirun Emigrants They love those who have migrated to them and do not covet what has been given them they even prefer them above themselves though poverty be their own lot
And whosoever are preserved from their own greed such are the ones that will prosper
And it also belongs to those who came after them and who pray “ Lord forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith and do not put in our hearts any rancour towards those who believe Lord You are the Most Tender the Most Compassionate ”
Did you not see the hypocrites say to their brethren the unbelievers among the People of the Book “ If you are banished we too will go with you and will not listen to anyone concerning you and if war is waged against you we will come to your aid ”
But Allah bears witness that they are liars
To be sure if they are banished they will not go with them and if war is waged against them they will not aid them and even if they provide any aid to them they will still turn their backs and thereafter no aid will be forthcoming to them
Surely they have greater dread for you in their hearts than for Allah
That is because they are a people who are devoid of understanding
They will never fight against you as a body in an open battlefield and if they fight against you they will fight only in fortified townships or from behind walls
Intense is their hostility to one another
You reckon them united while their hearts are divided
That is because they are a people devoid of reason
They are like those who tasted the evil consequences of their deeds a short while before A grievous chastisement awaits them
Their parable is that of Satan when he says to man “ Disbelieve ” but when he disbelieves he says “ I am quit of you
Verily I fear Allah the Lord of the Universe ”
In the end both will be in the Fire and will abide in it
That is the recompense of the wrongdoers
Believers fear Allah and let every person look to what he sends forward for the morrow Fear Allah Allah is well aware of all that you do
And be not like those who forgot Allah and so He made them oblivious of themselves
They are the wicked ones
Those destined for the Fire and those destined for Paradise cannot be alike
Verily it is those destined for Paradise who shall triumph
Had We sent down this Qur an upon a mountain you would indeed have seen it humbling itself and breaking asunder out of fear of Allah
We propound such parables to people that they may reflect
He is Allah there is no god but He the Knower of the unseen and the manifest He is the Most Merciful the Most Compassionate
He is Allah there is no god but He the King the Holy the AllPeace the Giver of security the Overseer the Most Mighty the Overpowering the AllGreat
Exalted be He from whatever they associate with Him
He is Allah the Planner Executer and Fashioner of creation
His are the names most beautiful
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth extols His Glory
He is the Most Mighty the Most Wise
Believers if you have left your homes and have come forth to struggle in My Way and to seek My good pleasure do not make friends with My enemies and your enemies
You befriend them whereas they have spurned the Truth that has come to you and such is their enmity that they expel the Messenger and yourselves for no other reason than that you believe in Allah your Lord
You send to them messages of friendship in secrecy although I know well whatever you do be it secretly or publicly
And whosoever of you does so has indeed strayed far away from the Straight Path
If they could overcome you they would act as your foes and would hurt you by their hands and tongues and would love to see you become unbelievers
On the Day of Resurrection neither your bloodkindred nor your own offspring will avail you
On that Day He will separate you
Allah sees all that you do
You have a good example in Abraham and his companions they said to their people “ We totally dissociate ourselves from you and from the deities that you worship instead of Allah We renounce you and there has come to be enmity and hatred between us and you until you believe in Allah the One True God ” But you may not emulate Abraham s saying to his father “ Certainly I will ask pardon for you although I have no power over Allah to obtain anything on your behalf ” And Abraham and his companions prayed “ Our Lord in You have we put our trust and to You have we turned and to You is our ultimate return
Our Lord do not make us a test for the unbelievers and forgive us our Lord
Surely You are Most Mighty Most Wise ”
Indeed there is a good example for you in them a good example for anyone who looks forward to Allah and the Last Day
As for him who turns away Allah is AllSufficient Immensely Praiseworthy
It may well be that Allah will implant love between you and those with whom you have had enmity
Allah is Most Powerful and Allah is Most Forgiving Most Compassionate
Allah does not forbid that you be kind and just to those who did not fight against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes
Surely Allah loves those who are equitable
Allah only forbids you to be friends with those who have fought against you on account of religion and who have driven you out of your homes and have abetted in your expulsion
And any who make friends with them they are the wrongdoers
Believers when believing women come to you as Emigrants in the cause of faith examine them
Allah fully knows the truth concerning their faith
And when you have ascertained them to be believing women do not send them back to the unbelievers
Those women are no longer lawful to the unbelievers nor are those unbelievers lawful to those believing women
Give their unbelieving husbands whatever they have spent as bridaldues and there is no offence for you to marry those women if you give them their bridaldues
Do not hold on to your marriages with unbelieving women ask for the return of the bridaldue you gave to your unbelieving wives and the unbelievers may ask for the return of the bridaldue they had given to their believing wives
Such is Allah s command
He judges between you
Allah is AllKnowing Most Wise
And if you fail to receive from the unbelievers a part of the bridaldue of your disbelieving wives and then your turn comes pay to those who have been left on the other side an amount the like of the bridaldue that they have paid
And have fear of Allah in Whom you believe
O Prophet when believing women come to you and pledge to you that they will not associate aught with Allah in His Divinity that they will not steal that they will not commit illicit sexual intercourse that they will not kill their children that they will not bring forth a calumny between their hands and feet and that they will not disobey you in anything known to be good then accept their allegiance and ask Allah to forgive them
Surely Allah is Most Forgiving Most Compassionate
Believers do not make friends with those against whom Allah is wrathful and who are despaired of the Hereafter as despaired as are the unbelievers lying in their graves
All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth extols Allah s glory
He is the Most Mighty the Most Wise
Believers why do you profess that which you do not practise
It is most loathsome in the sight of Allah that you should profess what you do not practise
Allah indeed loves those who fight in His Way as though they are a solid wall cemented with molten lead
And call to mind when Moses said to his people “ O my people why do you torment me when you know well that I am Allah s Messenger to you ”
So when they deviated Allah made their hearts deviant
Allah does not direct the evildoers to the Right Way
And call to mind when Jesus son of Mary said “ O Children of Israel I am Allah s Messenger to you I verify the Torah which has come before me and I give you the glad tiding of a Messenger who shall come after me his name being Ahmad ”
Yet when he came to them with Clear Signs they said “ This is sheer trickery ”
Who would be more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah the while he is being called to Islam
Allah does not direct such evildoing folk to the Right Way
They seek to extinguish Allah s light by blowing with their mouths but Allah shall spread His light in all its fullness howsoever the unbelievers may abhor this
He it is Who has sent forth the Messenger with the Guidance and the True Religion that He may make it prevail over all religion however those that associate aught with Allah in His Divinity might dislike this
Believers shall I direct you to a commerce that will deliver you from a grievous chastisement
Have faith in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the Way of Allah with your possessions and your lives
That is better for you if you only knew
He will forgive you your sins and will admit you to Gardens beneath which rivers flow He will lodge you in excellent mansions in the Gardens of eternity
That is the supreme triumph
He will also grant you the other favour that you desire help from Allah and a victory that will come soon
Give glad tidings of this to the believers
Believers become Allah s helpers as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples “ Who is my helper in calling people to Allah ” The disciples had responded by saying “ We are Allah s helpers ”
Then a section of the Children of Israel believed and a section rejected the call
Thereafter We aided the believers against their enemies and they prevailed
All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols the glory of Allah the Sovereign the Holy the All Mighty the AllWise
He it is Who has sent to the gentiles a Messenger from among themselves one who rehearses to them His verses purifies their lives and imparts to them the Book and the Wisdom although before that they were in utter error
and He has also sent him to those others who have not yet joined them
He is the Most Mighty the Most Wise
Such is Allah s favour He bestows it on whomsoever He pleases
Allah is the Lord of abounding favour
The parable of those who were charged with the Torah and then they failed to live up to it is that of a donkey laden with books
Even more evil is the parable of the people who gave the lie to the Signs of Allah
Allah does not direct such wrongdoers to the Right Way
Tell them “ O you who have become Judaised if you arrogantly fancy that you are Allah s favourites to the exclusion of all people then wish for death if you are truthful in your claim ”
But they shall never wish for death because of the evil deeds they have committed
Allah is well aware of these evildoers
Tell them “ The death from which you flee will certainly overtake you
Then you will be returned to Him Who fully knows what is hidden and what is manifest
Thereupon He will let you know all that you used to do ”
Believers when the call for Prayer is made on Friday hasten to the remembrance of Allah and give up all trading
That is better for you if you only knew
But when the Prayer is ended disperse in the land and seek Allah s Bounty and remember Allah much so that you may prosper
Yet no sooner than they saw some trading or amusement they flocked to it and left you standing by yourself
Tell them “ That which is with Allah is far better than amusement and trading
Allah is the Best Provider of sustenance ”
O Prophet when the hypocrites come to you they say “ We bear witness that you are certainly Allah s Messenger ”
Allah certainly knows that you are His Messenger
But Allah also bears witness that the hypocrites are utter liars
They shelter behind their oath and thus hinder their own selves and others from the Path of Allah
Evil indeed is what they do
All that is because they first believed and then disbelieved and therefore a seal was set on their hearts as a result they understand nothing
When you look at them their persons are pleasing and when they speak you pay heed to what they say
But in truth they are merely beams of timber proppedup against a wall
They consider every shout they hear to be directed against them
They are your utter enemies guard against them
May Allah do away with them
How are they being turned away from the Truth
When it is said to them “ Come Allah s Messenger will seek forgiveness for you ” they contemptuously shake their heads and you see them holding back in pride
It is all the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or not for Allah shall never forgive them
Surely Allah does not direct the transgressing folk to the Right Way
It is they who say “ Give nothing to those who are with the Messenger of Allah so that they may disperse ”
They say so although the treasures of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah But the hypocrites do not understand
They say “ When we return to Madinah the honourable ones will drive out from it those that are abject ”
In truth all honour belongs to Allah and to His Messenger and to the believers But the hypocrites do not know
Believers let your possessions and your offspring not make you negligent of Allah s remembrance
For whoso does that they will be the losers
And spend of what Allah has granted you by way of sustenance before death should come to any of you and he should say “ Lord why did You not defer my return for a while so that I might give alms and be among the righteous ”
But when a person s term comes to an end Allah never grants any respite
Allah is well aware of all that you do
All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth extols Allah s glory
His is the sovereignty and to Him is all praise due He has power over everything
He it is Who has created you and among you are those that deny the Truth and among you are those that believe in it
Allah observes all that you do
He created the heavens and the earth with Truth and shaped you giving you excellent shapes
And to Him is your ultimate return
He knows what is in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you disclose
Allah even knows what lies hidden in the breasts of people
Has the news of the unbelievers of the past not reached you They disbelieved and then tasted its evil consequence
A grievous chastisement awaits them
This was because their Messengers would come to them with Clear Signs but they would say “ Shall mortals like ourselves guide us to the Right Way ”
They rejected the Truth and turned away
Thereupon Allah became unconcerned with them for Allah is SelfSufficient Innately Praiseworthy
The unbelievers have vehemently contended that they shall not be raised to life
Say to them “ Yes by my Lord you shall surely be raised to life and you shall certainly be fully informed of all that you did
That is easy enough for Allah ”
So believe in Allah and in His Messenger and in the Light that We have sent down
Allah is fully aware of what you do
You shall come to know that when He will assemble you on the Day of Gathering
That shall be the Day to determine mutual gains and losses
Whoever believes in Allah and acts righteously Allah will have his evil deeds expunged and will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow
Therein they shall abide forever
That is the supreme triumph
As for those who disbelieved and gave the lie to Our Signs they shall be the inmates of the Fire and will abide in it
That is a woeful resort
No misfortune ever befalls unless it be by Allah s leave
And whosoever has faith in Allah Allah directs his heart along the Right Path
Allah has knowledge of everything
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger
But if you turn away from obedience then know that Our Messenger has no other duty than to clearly convey the Truth
Allah there is no god but He in Allah should the believers put all their trust
Believers there are enemies to you from among your spouses and your offspring so beware of them
But if you forgive and overlook their offences and pardon them then surely Allah is Most Forgiving Most Compassionate
Your possessions and your offspring are nothing but a trial for you
And there awaits a great reward for you with Allah
So hold Allah in awe as much as you can and listen and obey and be charitable This is for your own good
And whoever remains safe from his own greediness it is such that will prosper
If you give Allah a goodly loan He will increase it for you several fold and will forgive you
Allah is Most Appreciative Most Forbearing
He knows that which is beyond the ken of perception as well as that which can be perceived He is the Most Mighty the Most Wise
O Prophet when you divorce women divorce them for their waitingperiod and compute the waiting period accurately and hold Allah your Lord in awe
Do not turn them out of their homes during the waiting period – nor should they go away from their homes – unless they have committed a manifestly evil deed
Such are the bounds set by Allah and he who transgresses the bounds set by Allah commits a wrong against himself
You do not know maybe Allah will cause something to happen to pave the way for reconciliation
And when they reach the end of their term of waiting then either honourably retain them in the bond of wedlock or honourably part with them and call two persons of known probity as witnesses from among yourselves and let these witnesses give upright testimony for the sake of Allah
That is to what all those that believe in Allah and the Last Day are exhorted
Allah will find a way out for him who fears Allah
and will provide him sustenance from whence he never even imagined
Whoever puts his trust in Allah He shall suffice him
Surely Allah brings about what He decrees Allah has set a measure for everything
The waiting period of those of your women who have lost all expectation of menstruation shall be three months in case you entertain any doubt and the same shall apply to those who have not yet menstruated
As for pregnant women their waiting period shall be until the delivery of their burden
Allah will create ease for him who fears Allah
This is the commandment of Allah that He has revealed to you
Whoever fears Allah He will expunge his evil deeds and will richly reward him
During the waiting period lodge them according to your means wherever you dwell and do not harass them to make them miserable
And if they are pregnant provide for them maintenance until they have delivered their burden
And if they suckle your offspring whom they bore you then give them due recompense and graciously settle the question of compensation between yourselves by mutual understanding
But if you experience difficulty in determining the compensation for suckling then let another woman suckle the child
Whoever has abundant means let him spend according to his means and he whose means are straitened let him spend out of what Allah has given him
Allah does not burden any human being beyond the means that He has bestowed upon him
Possibly Allah will grant ease after hardship
How many towns rebelled against the commandment of their Lord and His Messengers
Then We called them to a stern accounting and subjected them to a harrowing chastisement
So they tasted the evil fruit of their deeds and the fruit of their deeds was utter loss
Allah has laid in store for them a grievous chastisement
So fear Allah O people of understanding who have attained to faith
Allah has sent down to you an Exhortation
a Messenger who rehearses to you Allah s verses that clearly expound the Guidance so that He may bring out those that believe and act righteously from every kind of darkness into light
He will admit whosoever believes in Allah and acts righteously to Gardens beneath which rivers flow They shall abide in them forever
For such has Allah made an excellent provision
Allah it is He Who created seven heavens and like them the earth
His commandment descends among them All this is being stated so that you know that Allah has power over everything and that Allah encompasses all things in His knowledge
O Prophet why do you forbid what Allah has made lawful for you Is it to please your wives
Allah is Most Forgiving Most Compassionate
Allah has prescribed for you a way for the absolution of your oaths
Allah is your Guardian
He is AllKnowing Most Wise
The Prophet confided something to one of his wives and then she disclosed it to another so after Allah revealed to the Prophet that she had disclosed that secret he made a part of it known to her and passed over a part of it
And when he told her about this ie that she had disclosed the secret entrusted to her she asked “ Who informed you of this ”
He said “ I was told of it by He Who is AllKnowing AllAware ”
If the two of you turn in repentance to Allah that is better for you for the hearts of both of you have swerved from the Straight Path
But if you support one another against the Prophet then surely Allah is his Protector and after that Gabriel and all righteous believers and the angels are all his supporters
Maybe if he were to divorce you your Lord might grant him in exchange wives better than you – those who truly submit to Allah are full of faith obedient disposed to repentance and given to worship and fasting – both previously wedded ones and virgins
Believers guard yourselves and your kindred against a Fire whose fuel is human beings and stones a Fire held in the charge of fierce and stern angels who never disobey what He has commanded them and always do what they are bidden
It will then be said “ Unbelievers make no excuses today
You are being recompensed for nothing else but your deeds ”
Believers turn to Allah in sincere repentance maybe your Lord will expunge your evil deeds and admit you to the Gardens beneath which rivers flow This will be on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who have embraced faith and are with him their light will be running before them and on their right hands and they will say “ Our Lord perfect for us our light and forgive us Surely You have power over everything ”
O Prophet strive against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be severe with them
Hell shall be their resort
What a grievous end
Allah has set forth for the unbelievers the parable of the wives of Noah and Lot
They were wedded to two of Our righteous servants but each acted treacherously with her husband and their husbands could be of no avail to them against Allah
The two of them were told “ Enter the Fire with all the others who enter it ”
Allah has set forth for the believers the parable of Pharaoh s wife She prayed “ My Lord build for me a house with You in Paradise and deliver me from Pharaoh and his misdeeds and deliver me from the iniquitous people ”
Allah has also set forth the parable of Mary the daughter of Imran who guarded her chastity and into whom We breathed of Our Spirit and who testified to the words of her Lord and His Books
She was among the obedient
Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion of the Universe and Who has power over everything
Who created death and life that He might try you as to which of you is better in deed
He is the Most Mighty the Most Forgiving
Who created the seven heavens one upon another
You will see no incongruity in the Merciful One s creation
Turn your vision again can you see any flaw
Then turn your vision again and then again in the end your vision will come back to you worn out and frustrated
We have adorned the lower heaven with lamps and have made them a means to drive away the satans
We have prepared for them the chastisement of the Blazing Fire
The chastisement of Hell awaits those who disbelieve in their Lord
What a wretched destination
When they will be cast into it they will hear it roar as it boils
as though it will burst with rage
Every time a multitude is cast into it its keepers will ask them “ Did no warner come to you ”
They will say “ Yes a warner came to us but we gave the lie to him and said Allah has revealed nothing You are surely in huge error
They will say If we had only listened and understood we would not be among the inmates of the Blazing Fire ”
Thus will they confess their sins
Damned are these inmates of the Blazing Fire
Surely forgiveness and a mighty reward await those who fear Allah without seeing Him
Whether you speak in secrecy or aloud it is all the same to Allah He even knows the secrets that lie hidden in the breasts of people
Would He not know He Who has created when He is AllSubtle AllAware
He it is Who made the earth subservient to you
So traverse in its tracks and partake of the sustenance He has provided
To Him will you be resurrected
Do you feel secure that He Who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to cave in with you and then suddenly it will begin to rock violently
Do you feel secure that He Who is in the heaven will not let loose upon you a storm of stones
Then shall you know what My warning is like
Those who came before them also gave the lie to the Messengers then how awesome was My chastisement
Have they not seen birds above them spreading and closing their wings with none holding them except the Merciful One
He oversees everything
Which is your army that will come to your aid against the Merciful Lord
But the unbelievers are in utter delusion
Who shall provide for you if He withholds His sustenance
Nay but they persist in rebellion and aversion
Who is better guided he who walks grovelling on his face or he who walks upright on a Straight Path
Say “ He it is Who has brought you into being and has given you hearing and sight and has given you hearts to think and understand
How seldom do you give thanks ”
Say “ Allah it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you will be mustered ”
They say “ If you are truthful tell us when will this promise of the Hereafter be fulfilled ”
Say “ Allah alone knows about that and I am no more than a plain warner ”
When they will see it near at hand the faces of all those who had denied it will be distraught and then they will be told “ This is the doom which you used to ask for ”
Say to them “ Did you ever consider whether Allah destroys me and those that are with me or shows mercy to us who can protect the unbelievers from a grievous chastisement ”
Say to them “ He is Merciful and it is in Him that we believe and it is in Him that we put all our trust
Soon will you know who is in manifest error ”
Say to them “ Did you even consider if all the water that you have in the wells were to sink down into the depths of the earth who will produce for you clear flowing water ”
Nun
By the pen and what the scribes write
By your Lord s Grace you are not afflicted with madness
and surely yours shall be a neverending reward
and you are certainly on the most exalted standard of moral excellence
So you will soon see and they too will see
which of you is afflicted with madness
Surely your Lord knows well those who have strayed from His Way just as He knows well those who are on the Right Way
Do not then yield to those who reject the Truth decrying it as false
they would wish you to be pliant so that they too may be pliant
And do not yield to any contemptible swearer
the faultfinder who goes around slandering
the hinderer of good the transgressor the sinful
the coarsegrained and above all mean and ignoble
who so acts simply because he has wealth and sons
and whenever Our verses are rehearsed to him he says “ These are fairy tales of times gone by ”
Soon shall We brand him on his snout
We have put them ie the Makkans to test even as We put to test the owners of the orchard when they vowed that they would gather the fruit of their orchard in the morning
without making any allowance for the will of Allah
Thereupon a calamity from your Lord passed over it while they were asleep
and so by morning the orchard lay as though it had been fully harvested
At daybreak they called out to one another
“ Hurry to your orchard if you would gather its fruit ”
So off they went whispering to one another
“ No destitute person shall enter it today ”
They went forth early believing that they had the power to gather the fruit
But as soon as they beheld the orchard they cried out “ We have certainly lost the way
rather we are utterly ruined ”
The best among them said “ Did I not say to you why do you not give glory to your Lord ”
They cried out “ Glory be to our Lord
Certainly we were sinners ”
Then they began to reproach one another
They said “ Woe to us
We had indeed transgressed
Maybe our Lord will give us a better orchard in its place to our Lord do we penitently turn ”
Such is the chastisement and the chastisement of the Hereafter is assuredly even greater if only they knew
Surely the Godfearing shall have Gardens of bliss with their Lord
What Shall We treat those who have submitted to Our command like those who have acted as criminals
What is the matter with you How ill do you judge
Or do you have a Book wherein you read
that in the Hereafter you shall have all that you choose for yourselves
Or have We sworn a covenant with you which We are bound to keep till the Day of Resurrection a covenant requiring that whatever you ordain for yourselves shall be yours
Ask them “ Which of them can guarantee that
Or has something been guaranteed by any of those whom they associate with Allah in His Divinity ”
If so let them bring forth their associates if they are truthful
On the Day when the dreadful calamity will unfold when people will be summoned to prostrate themselves and yet they will not be able to prostrate
Their eyes shall be downcast and ignominy shall overwhelm them
For when they were safe and sound they were summoned to prostrate themselves and they refused
So leave Me O Prophet to deal with him who gives the lie to this Discourse
We shall draw them little by little to their undoing in a way that they will not know
I am giving them a respite
Great is My scheme
Or are you asking them for some compensation so that they feel burdened with debt
Or do they have any knowledge of the Unseen which they are now writing down
So bear with patience until the Judgement of your Lord comes and do not belike the man in the fish ie Jonah who called out choking with grief
had his Lord not bestowed His favour upon him he would have been cast upon that barren shore and would have remained there in disgrace
But his Lord exalted him and included him among His righteous servants
When the unbelievers hear this Exhortation they look at you as though they would knock you off your feet with their hostile glances
They say “ Surely he is afflicted with madness ”
although this is nothing but an Exhortation to goodness for everyone in the world
The indubitable event
And what is that indubitable event
And what do you know what that indubitable event is
The Thamud and the Ad denied the possibility of a sudden calamity calling it false
Then the Thamud were destroyed by an awesome upheaval
and the Ad were destroyed by a furiously raging windstorm
which He let loose upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession so that if you had been there you might have seen people lying prostrate as though they were uprooted trunks of hollowed palm trees
Do you now see any trace of them
Pharaoh and those before him and the people of the overturned habitations all engaged in the same great sin
They did not follow the Messenger of their Lord and so He seized them with a severe grip
Verily when the water rose to great heights We bore you upon a floating vessel ie the Ark
so that We might make it an instructive event for you and retentive ears might preserve its memory
So when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast
and the earth and the mountains are carried aloft and are crushed to bits at one stroke
on that Day shall that indubitable event come to pass
when the sky will be rent asunder the grip holding it together having loosened on that Day
and the angels will stand on the sides with eight of them bearing aloft the Throne of your Lord on that Day
That will be the Day when you shall be brought forth before Allah and no secret of yours shall remain hidden
On that Day he whose Record is given to him in his right hand will say “ Lo Read my Record
Verily I was sure that I would be handed over my account ”
Then he shall find himself in a life of bliss
in a lofty Garden
the clusters of whose fruit will be hanging low to be within reach of the inmates of Paradise
They will be told “ Eat and drink with good cheer as a reward for the good deeds you did in the days that have passed by ”
As for him whose Record will be given to him in his left hand he will exclaim “ Would that I had never been given my Record
and had not known my account
Oh Would that the death that came to me in the world had made an end of me
My riches have not availed me
and my authority has vanished ”
A command will be issued “ Seize him and shackle him
then cast him in the Fire
then fasten him with a chain seventy cubits long
He would not believe in Allah the Most Great
nor would he urge the feeding of the poor
Today he has been left here friendless
and has no food except the filth from the washing of wounds
which only the sinners will eat ”
But no I swear by what you see
and by what you do not see
that this is the speech of an honourable Messenger
not the speech of a poet
Little do you believe
Nor is this the speech of a soothsayer
Little do you reflect
It has been revealed by the Lord of the Universe
And if he ie the Prophets had forged this Discourse and thereafter ascribed it to Us
We would surely have seized him by the right hand
and then severed his life vein
and not one of you would have been able to withhold Us from doing so
Surely it is a Good Counsel for the Godfearing
We certainly know that some among you will give the lie to it
and surely it will be a cause of regret for the unbelievers
Certainly it is a Truth of absolute certainty
So glorify the name of your Lord Most Great
A beseecher besought the visitation of chastisement
a chastisement meant for the unbelievers one which none can avert
a chastisement from Allah the Lord of the ascending steps
by which the angels and the Spirit ascend to Him in one Day the duration of which is fifty thousand years
So O Prophet persevere with gracious perseverance
Verily they think that the chastisement is far off
while We think that it is near at hand
It shall befall on a Day whereon the sky will become like molten brass
and the mountains will become like dyed tufts of wool
and no bosom friend will enquire about any of his bosom friends
although they shall be within sight of one another
The guilty one would fain ransom himself from the torment of that Day by offering his children
and his spouse and his brother
and his kinsfolk who had stood by him
and all persons of the earth if only he could thus save himself
By no means
It will be the fierce flame
that will strip off the scalp
It shall insistently summon him who turned his back and retreated
and amassed wealth and covetously hoarded it
Verily man is impatient by nature
bewailing when evil befalls him
and tightfisted when good fortune visits him
except those that pray
and are constant in their Prayer
and those in whose wealth there is a known right
for those that ask and those that are dispossessed
those who firmly believe in the Day of Recompense
and fear the chastisement of their Lord –
surely the chastisement of their Lord is a thing none can feel secure from –
and those who guard their private parts
except in regard to their spouses and those whom their right hands possess for in regard to them they are not reproachable
but any who seeks to go beyond that it is indeed they who are the transgressors
and those who fulfil their trusts and their covenants
and those who are upright in their testimonies
and who take due care of their Prayer
all these shall live honourably in the Gardens
But what is the matter with the unbelievers who are hurrying towards you
in crowds both on the right and on the left
Does everyone of them wish to enter the Garden of Bliss
By no means
They know that which We have created them from
I swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests that We have the power
to replace them by others who would be better than they and We shall certainly not be overpowered
So leave them to engage in vain talk and to amuse themselves until they come face to face with the Day which they are promised
the Day on which they will hastily come forth from their graves as though they were hurrying on to the altars of their deities
Their eyes will be downcast and disgrace will overwhelm them
Such is the Day that they were promised
We sent Noah to his people and directed him “ Warn your people before a grievous chastisement comes upon them ”
Noah said “ My people I have certainly been sent as a clear warner to you
that you serve Allah and fear Him and follow me
He will forgive your sins and will grant you respite until an appointed term
Indeed when Allah s appointed term comes it cannot be deferred if you only knew ”
He said “ My Lord I called my people by night and by day
but the more I called the farther they fled
And every time I called them so that You might forgive them they thrust their fingers into their ears and wrapped up their faces with their garments and obstinately clung to their attitude and waxed very proud
Then I summoned them openly
and preached to them in public and also addressed them in secret
I said to them “ Ask forgiveness from your Lord surely He is Most Forgiving
He will shower upon you torrents from heaven
and will provide you with wealth and children and will bestow upon you gardens and rivers
What is amiss with you that you do not look forward to the majesty of Allah
when He has created you in stages
Do you not see how Allah has created seven heavens one upon the other
and has placed the moon in them as a light and the sun as a radiant lamp
And Allah has caused you to grow out of the earth so wondrously
and He will later cause you to return to it and will then again bring you out of it
Allah has made the earth a wide expanse for you
so that you may tread its spacious paths ”
Noah said “ My Lord they did not pay heed to what I said and followed those nobles whose possession of wealth and children has led them to an even greater loss
They contrived a plot of great magnitude
They said “ Do not abandon your deities do not abandon Wadd nor Suwa nor Yaghuth nor Yauq nor Nasr
They have misled many
So do not enable these evildoers to increase in anything except straying from the Right Way ”
And so they were drowned on account of their sins and then cast into the Fire and did not find any other than Allah to come forth to their help
Noah said “ My Lord do not leave out of these unbelievers even a single dweller on earth
for certainly if You should leave them alive they will mislead Your servants and will beget none but sinners and utter unbelievers
My Lord forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house as a believer and forgive all believers both men and women and do not increase the wrongdoers in anything except perdition ”
Say O Prophet it was revealed to me that a band of jinn attentively listened to the recitation of the Qur an and then went back to their people and said
“ We have indeed heard a wonderful Qur an which guides to the Right Way so we have come to believe in it and we will not associate aught with Our Lord in His Divinity ”
and that “ He – exalted be His Majesty – has not taken to Himself either a wife or a son ”
and that “ the foolish among us have been wont to say outrageous things about Allah ”
and that “ we had thought that men and jinn would never speak a lie about Allah ”
and that “ some from among the humans used to seek protection of some among the jinn and thus they increased the arrogance of the jinn ”
and that “ they thought even as you thought that Allah would never raise anyone as a Messenger ”
and that “ we tried to pry the secrets of the heaven but we found it full of terrible guards and shooting meteors ”
and that “ we would take up stations in the heaven to try to hear but anyone who now attempts to listen finds a shooting meteor in wait for him ”
and that “ we do not know whether evil is intended for those on the earth or whether their Lord intends to direct them to the Right Way ”
and that “ some of us are upright and some of us are otherwise for we follow widely divergent paths ”
and that “ we thought that we will neither be able to frustrate Allah on earth nor frustrate Him by flight ”
and that “ when we heard the teaching of the Right Way we came to believe in it he who believes in His Lord shall have no fear of suffering loss or being subjected to any injustice ”
and that “ among us some are Muslims Those who have submitted to Allah and some of us are deviant
So those who became Muslims found the Right Course
but those who deviated from the Truth will be the fuel for Hell ”
If people were to keep firmly to the Right Way We would have vouchsafed them abundant rain
so that We might try them through this bounty
Whoso turns away from the remembrance of his Lord He will cause him to suffer a grievous chastisement
and that “ mosques belong to Allah so do not invoke anyone with Him ”
and when Allah s servant stood up to call on Him they wellnigh swarmed him
Say O Prophet “ I call on my Lord alone and I do not associate aught with Him in His Divinity ”
Say “ Surely neither it is in my power to hurt you nor to bring you to the Right Way ”
Say “ None can protect me from Allah nor can I find a refuge apart from Him
My task is no more than to deliver Allah s proclamation and His messages
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger surely the Fire of Hell awaits him therein he will abide in perpetuity ”
They shall not change their ways until they see that against which they had been warned and then they will know whose helpers are weaker and whose supporters are fewer in number
Say “ I know not whether what you are promised is near or whether my Lord will prolong its term
He is the Knower of the Unseen and He does not disclose His Unseen to anyone
other than to a Messenger whom He chooses for the bestowal of any part of the knowledge of the Unseen whereafter He appoints guards who go before him and behind him
so that He may know that they have delivered the messages of their Lord
He encompasses in His knowledge their surroundings and keeps a count of all things ”
O you the sleeping enwrapped one
Stand up in Prayer by night all but a small part of it
half of it or reduce it a little
or add to it a little and recite the Qur an slowly and distinctly
Behold We shall cast upon you a Weighty Word
Surely getting up at night is the best means of subduing the self and is more suitable for uprightness in speech
You are indeed much occupied during the day with the affairs of the world
So remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with exclusive devotion
He is the Lord of the East and the West there is no god but He
So take Him alone for your Guardian
And bear patiently the vain things they utter and gracefully forsake them
Leave it to Me to deal with the affluent ones who give the lie to the Truth and bear with them for a while
We have heavy fetters and a blazing Fire in store for them
and a food that chokes and a grievous chastisement
They will come across all this on the Day when the earth and the mountains shall tremble violently and the mountains shall crumble into heaps of scattered sand
Surely We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness over you just as We had sent a Messenger to Pharaoh
But Pharaoh disobeyed Our Messenger so We seized him with a terrible seizing
If you persist in disbelieving how will you guard yourself against the woe of the Day that will turn children greyhaired
the Day whose severity shall cause the heaven to split asunder
Allah s promise is ever bound to be fulfilled
Indeed this is nothing but a Good Counsel so let him who will take a way leading to his Lord
O Prophet your Lord knows that you sometimes stand up in Prayer nearly twothirds of the night and sometimes half or onethird of it and so does a party of those with you Allah measures the night and the day
He knows that you cannot keep an accurate count of it so He has shown mercy to you
So now recite as much of the Qur an as you can
He knows that there are among you those who are sick and others who are journeying in the land in quest of Allah s bounty and still others who are fighting in the cause of Allah
So recite as much of the Qur an as you easily can and establish Prayer and pay Zakah and give Allah a goodly loan
Whatever good you send forth for yourselves you shall find it with Allah That is better and its reward is greater
And ask for Allah s forgiveness surely He is Most Forgiving Most Compassionate
O you enveloped in your cloak
Arise and warn
and magnify the glory of your Lord
and purify your robes
and shun uncleanness
and bestow not favour in order to seek from others a greater return
and persevere for your Lord s sake
When the Trumpet shall be sounded
that will surely be a hard day
not an easy day for the unbelievers
Leave Me with him whom I alone have created
whom I have endowed with abundant riches
and sons ever present with him
and for whom I have smoothed the way to power and riches
and who still greedily desires that I should bestow upon him more
By no means he is stubbornly opposed to Our Signs
I shall soon constrain him to a hard ascent
He reflected and then hatched a scheme
Ruin seize him how did he hatch a scheme
Again ruin seize him how did he hatch a scheme
He looked at others
then frowned and scowled
then he retreated and waxed proud
and said “ This Qur an is merely a sorcery of yore
this is nothing but the word of a mere mortal ”
Him shall I soon roast in Hell
And what do you know what Hell is
It spares nothing it leaves nothing intact
it scorches even the skin
Over it are nineteen keepers
We have appointed none but angels as the keepers of the Fire and We have not made their number but as a trial for the unbelievers so that those who have been endowed with the Book will be convinced and the believers faith will increase and neither those who have been endowed with the Book nor the believers will fall into any doubt As for those in whose hearts there is a sickness as well as the unbelievers they will say “ What did Allah aim at by this strange parable ”
Thus does Allah let whomsoever He pleases to go astray and directs whomsoever He pleases to the Right Way
And none knows the hosts of your Lord but He
And Hell has only been mentioned here that people may take heed
Nay by the moon
and by the night when it recedes
and by the day when it dawns with its radiance
surely Hell is one of the greatest Signs
a warning to humankind
a warning to everyone of you whether he would like to come forward or lag behind
Each one is a hostage to one s deeds
save the People of the Right Hand
who shall be in the Gardens and shall ask
about the guilty ones
“ What drove you to Hell ”
They will answer “ We were not among those who observed Prayer
and we did not feed the poor
and we indulged in vain talk with those who indulged in vain talk
and we gave the lie to the Day of Judgement
until the inevitable event overtook us ”
The intercession of the intercessors shall then be of no avail to them
What is the matter with people that they are turning away from this Exhortation
as though they were frightened wild asses
fleeing from a lion
No indeed each one of them desires that open letters be sent to each of them
No indeed the truth is that they have no fear of the Hereafter
Nay this is an Exhortation
So whoever wills may benefit from it
But they will not benefit from it unless Allah Himself so wills
He is worthy to be feared and He is worthy to forgive those that fear Him
Nay I swear by the Day of Resurrection
and nay I swear by the selfreproaching soul
Does man imagine that We will not be able to bring his bones together again
Yes indeed We have the power to remould even his fingertips
But man desires to persist in his evil ways
He asks “ When will the Day of Resurrection be ”
When the sight is dazed
and the moon is eclipsed
and the sun and the moon are joined together
on that Day will man say “ Whither the refuge ”
No there is no refuge
With your Lord alone will be the retreat that Day
On that Day will man be apprised of his deeds both the earlier and the later
But lo man is well aware of himself
even though he might make up excuses
O Prophet do not stir your tongue hastily to commit the Revelation to memory
Surely it is for Us to have you commit it to memory and to recite it
And so when We recite it follow its recitation attentively
then it will be for Us to explain it
Nay the truth is that you love ardently the good of this world that can be obtained hastily
and are oblivious of the Hereafter
Some faces on that Day will be fresh and resplendent
and will be looking towards their Lord
and some faces on that Day will be gloomy
believing that a crushing calamity is about to strike them
Nay when a man s soul reaches up to the throat
and it is said “ Is there any enchanter who can step forward and help by his chanting ”
and he realises that the hour of parting is come
and calf is intertwined with calf
On that Day you will be driven to your Lord
But he did not verify the Truth nor did he observe Prayer
on the contrary he gave the lie to the Truth and turned his back upon it
then he went back to his kinsfolk elated with pride
This attitude is worthy of you altogether worthy
again it is worthy of you altogether worthy
Does man think that he will be left alone unquestioned
Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen
then he became a clot and then Allah made it into a living body and proportioned its parts
and then He made of him a pair male and female
Does He then not have the power to bring back the dead to life
Was there a period of time when man was not even worthy of a mention
Verily We created man out of a drop of intermingled sperm so that We might try him and We therefore endowed him with hearing and sight
Surely We showed him the Right Path regardless of whether he chooses to be thankful or unthankful to his Lord
For the unbelievers We have kept ready chains and fetters and a Blazing Fire
The virtuous shall drink from a cup tempered with camphor water
This will be a gushing spring wherefrom Allah s servants shall drink wine a spring from which they will take out channels wherever they wish
These will be the ones who fulfil their vows and dread the Day whose woe shall be spread far and wide
those who for the love of Him feed the needy and the orphan and the captive
saying “ We feed you only for Allah s sake we do not seek of you any recompense or thanks
we fear from our Lord a Day that shall be long and distressful ”
So Allah shall guard them against the woe of that Day and will procure them freshness and joy
and will reward them for their steadfastness with Paradise and robes of silk
There they will recline on elevated couches and will be subjected neither to the burning heat of the sun nor to bitter cold
The shades of Paradise will bend over them and its fruits will be brought within their easy reach
and there shall be passed around them vessels of silver and goblets of crystal
goblets bright as crystal but made of silver filled to exact measure
Therein they shall be served a cup flavoured with ginger
drawn from a spring in Paradise called Salsabil
There boys of everlasting youth shall go about attending them when you see them you would think that they are scattered pearls
Whitherto you look around you will see an abundance of bliss and the glories of a great kingdom
They ie the virtuous shall be attired in garments of fine green silk and rich brocade and will be adorned with bracelets of silver
Their Lord will give them a pure wine to drink
Behold this is your recompense and your endeavour has been appreciated
O Prophet indeed We have revealed the Qur an to you in portions
So persevere with the command of your Lord and do not pay any heed to the wicked and the unbelieving
and remember the name of your Lord morning and evening
and prostrate yourself before Him at night and extol His Glory during the long watches of the night
Verily they love the good of this world that is hastily obtainable and are oblivious of the burdensome Day ahead of them
We created them and strengthened their joints and whenever We wish We can change their faces entirely
Verily this is an Exhortation so let him who so will take a way to his Lord
But your willing shall be of no avail until Allah Himself so wills
Surely Allah is AllKnowing Most Wise
He admits to His Mercy whomsoever He pleases
As for the wrongdoers He has prepared for them a grievous chastisement
By the winds sent forth in quick succession
which then blow tempestuously
and raise clouds and scatter them around
then winnow them thoroughly
and then cast Allah s remembrance in people s hearts
to serve as an excuse or a warning
Surely what you are promised shall come to pass
So when the stars are extinguished
and the sky is rent asunder
and the mountains are blown away
and the appointed time to bring the Messengers together arrives then shall the promised event come to pass
To which Day has this task been deferred
To the Day of Judgement
What do you know what the Day of Judgement is
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
Did We not destroy many a nation of the earlier times
And We shall cause those of later times to follow them
Thus do We deal with the guilty
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
Did We not create you of a mean fluid
which We then placed in a secure repository
until an appointed time
See that We had the power to do so
Great indeed is Our power to do what We will
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
Did We not make the earth a receptacle
for the living and the dead
and did We not firmly fix towering mountains on it and give you sweet water to drink
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
Proceed now towards that which you were wont to deny as false
proceed towards the threepronged shadow
which neither provides cooling shade nor protection against the flames
it indeed throws up sparks like castles
which seem as though they are yellowcoloured camels
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
That will be the Day on which they will not be able to utter a word
nor will they be allowed to proffer excuses
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
That is the Day of Judgement on which We have assembled you as well as all those who went before you
So if you have any ploy try it against Me
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
Behold today the Godfearing will be amidst shades and springs
and the fruits that they desire will be ready at hand
Eat and drink and may every joy attend you as a reward for your deeds
Thus do We reward those that do good
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
Eat and enjoy yourselves for a while
Surely you are evildoers
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
When it is said to them “ Bow down before Allah ” they do not bow down
Woe on that Day to those that give the lie to the Truth
In what discourse after this Qur an will they then believe
About what are they asking one another
Is it about the awesome tiding
that they are in utter disagreement
No indeed soon will they come to know
again no indeed soon will they come to know
Have We not spread the earth like a bed
and fixed the mountains like pegs
and created you in pairs as men and women
and made your sleep a means of repose
and made the night a covering
and made the day to seek livelihood
and built above you seven strong firmaments
and placed therein a hot shining lamp
and sent down abundant water from the clouds
so that We may thereby bring forth grain and vegetation
and gardens dense with foliage
Surely the Day of Judgement has an appointed time
the Day when the Trumpet shall be blown and you will come forth in multitudes
and when the sky shall be opened up and will become all doors
and the mountains will be set in motion and become a mirage
Surely the Hell is an ambush
a resort for the rebellious
therein they shall abide for ages
they shall taste in it no coolness nor any pleasant drink
save boiling water and wash of the wounds
a befitting recompense for their deeds
For indeed they did not look forward to any reckoning
and roundly denied Our Signs as false
And everything have We recorded in a Book
So taste the fruit of your deeds
We shall only increase your torment
Surely the state of triumph awaits the Godfearing
gardens and vineyards
and youthful maidens of like age
and an overflowing cup
Therein they shall hear no idle talk nor any falsehood
a recompense from your Lord and an ample reward
from the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of that which is between them the Most Merciful Lord before Whom none dare utter a word
The Day when the Spirit and the angels are ranged row on row None shall speak save he whom the Merciful Lord will permit and he too will speak what is right
That Day is sure to come
So let him who will seek a resort with his Lord
Lo We warn you of a chastisement near at hand the Day when a man will look on what his own hands have sent forth and the unbelievers shall say “ Oh would that I were utter dust ”
By those angels that pluck out the soul from depths
and gently take it away
and by those that speedily glide along the cosmos
and vie with the others in carrying out their Lord s behests
and then manage the affairs of the Universe according to their Lord s commands
The Day when the quaking will cause a violent convulsion
and will be followed by another quaking
On that Day some hearts shall tremble with fright
and their eyes shall be downcast with dread
They say “ Shall we indeed be restored to life
even after we have been reduced to bones hollow and rotten ”
They say “ That will then be a return with a great loss ”
Surely they will need no more than a single stern blast
and lo they will all be in the open plain
Has Moses story reached you
When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa
and directed him “ Go to Pharaoh he has rebelled
and say to him Are you willing to be purified
that I may direct you to your Lord and then you hold Him in awe ”
Then Moses went to Pharaoh and showed him the Great Sign
but he denied it as false and disobeyed
and then he turned back to have recourse to his craftiness
and gathered his people and declared
“ I am the supreme lord of you all ”
Thereupon Allah seized him for the chastisement of the World to Come as well as of the present
Surely there is a great lesson in it for whoever would fear Allah
Is it harder to create you or the heaven
But Allah built it
and raised its vault high and proportioned it
and covered its night with darkness and brought forth from it its day
and thereafter spread out the earth
and brought out of it its water and its pasture
and firmly fixed in it mountains
all this as provision for you and your cattle
But when the great calamity will come about
on the Day when man will recall all his strivings
and Hell will be brought in sight for anyone to see
then he who transgressed
and preferred the life of this world
most surely his abode shall be Hell
But he who feared to stand before his Lord and restrained himself from evil desires
most surely his abode shall be Paradise
They ask you about the Hour “ When will it be ”
What concern do you have to speak about that
Its knowledge rests with your Lord
You are only a warner to him who has a fear of it
On the Day they see it they will feel as though they had stayed in the grave no more than one evening or one morning
He frowned and turned away
that the blind man came to him
How could you know Perhaps he would cleanse himself
or he might be mindful and good counsel might avail him
Now he who waxes indifferent
you attend to him
though you are not to blame if he would not cleanse himself
But he who comes to you running
and fears Allah
you pay no heed to him
No indeed this is only a Reminder
So whoso wills may give heed to it
It is contained in scrolls highly honoured
most exalted and purified
borne by the hands of scribes
noble and purified
Accursed be man
How stubbornly he denies the Truth
Out of what did Allah create him
Out of a spermdrop did He create him and then determined a measure for him
and then made the course of life easy for him
then He caused him to die and brought him to the grave
and then whenever He wishes He will raise him back to life
Nay but man did not fulfil what Allah had enjoined upon him
So let man just consider his food
We poured water pouring it in great abundance
and cleaved the earth cleaving it asunder
then caused the grain to grow out of it
together with grapes and vegetables
and olives and palms
and dense orchards
and fruits and pastures –
all this as a provision for you and your cattle
But when the deafening cry shall be sounded
on the Day when each man shall flee from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his consort and his children
on that Day each will be occupied with his own business making him oblivious of all save himself
Some faces on that Day shall be beaming with happiness
and be cheerful and joyous
Some faces on that Day shall be dustridden
enveloped by darkness
These will be the unbelievers the wicked
When the sun shall be folded up
when the stars shall scatter away
when the mountains shall be set in motion
when the tenmonths pregnant camels shall be abandoned
when the savage beasts shall be brought together
when the seas shall be set boiling
when the souls shall be rejoined with their bodies
and when the girlchild buried alive shall be asked
for what offence was she killed
and when the scrolls of men s deeds shall be unfolded
and when Heaven is laid bare
and Hell is stoked
and Paradise brought nigh
then shall each person know what he has brought along
No indeed I swear by the alternating stars
that hide
and by the night as it recedes
and the morn as it breathes
Verily this is the word of a noble messagebearer
one mighty and held in honour with the Lord of the Throne
there he is obeyed and held trustworthy
O people of Makkah your companion is not mad
he indeed saw the messagebearer on the clear horizon
nor does he grudge conveying this knowledge about the Unseen
nor is it a word of an accursed Satan
Where to are you then heading
It is nothing but Good Counsel for everyone in the world
for everyone of you who wishes to follow the Straight Way
but your wishing will not avail unless Allah the Lord of the Universe so wishes
When the heaven is split asunder
when the stars are scattered
when the seas are made to burst forth
and when graves are laid open
everyone shall know all his deeds both the earlier and the later
O man
What has deceived you about your generous Lord
Who created you shaped you and made you wellproportioned
and set you in whatever form He pleased
No indeed the fact is that you deny the Reckoning declaring it a lie
you do so the while there are watchers over you
noble scribes
who know what you do
Surely the virtuous shall be in Bliss
and the wicked shall be in the Blazing Fire
They shall enter it on the Day of Recompense
and then shall never come out of it
What do you know what the Day of Recompense is
Again what do you know what the Day of Recompense is
It is the Day when no one shall have the power to do anything for another and all command shall be Allah s
Woe to the stinters
those who when they take from others by measure take their full share
but who when they measure or weigh for others give less than their due
Do they not realise that they will be raised to life
on a Great Day
a Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Universe
No indeed
Verily the deeds of the wicked are in the Record locked up in the prisonhouse
And how would you know what the Record of the prisonhouse is
It is a Book inscribed
Woe then to those that give the lie
those that give the lie to the Day of Recompense
Yet none gives the lie to it except the transgressor immersed in sin
who when Our verses are recited to him says “ Mere tales of olden times ”
No indeed
The truth is that their hearts have become rusted on account of their evil deeds
No indeed On that Day they will be screened off from seeing their Lord
and then they shall enter Hell
whereafter they will be told “ This is what you used to give the lie to ”
No indeed
Verily the deeds of the virtuous shall be in the record of the exalted ones
And what do you know what the Record of the exalted ones is
It is a Book inscribed
which the angels placed near Allah to safeguard
Verily the virtuous shall be in Bliss
resting on couches looking around
You shall see upon their faces the glow of bliss
They will be served a drink of the finest sealed wine
whose seal is musk – so let all aspirants aspire after that –
a wine whose mixture is Tasnim
a fountain at which the chosen ones shall drink
Behold the wicked were wont to laugh at the believers
when they passed by them they winked
and when they went back to their families they went back jesting
and when they saw the believers they said “ Lo These are the erring ones ”
they said so although they had not been appointed watchers over them
But today the believers are laughing at the unbelievers
seated upon their couches they are looking around
Have the unbelievers been duly rewarded for their deeds
When the sky is rent asunder
and hearkens to the command of its Lord doing what it should
and when the earth is stretched out
and casts out what is within it and is emptied
and hearkens to the command of its Lord doing what it should
O man you are striving unto your Lord and you will meet Him
Whoever is given the Record in his right hand
shall be called to an easy accounting
and shall return to his people joyfully
But he who is given the Record behind his back
shall cry for “ perdition ”
and will enter the Blazing Fire
He used to live joyfully among his people
thinking he would never revert to Us
But no how would he not revert
His Lord was ever watching him
Nay I swear by the twilight
and by the night and what it enfolds
and by the moon when it reaches its fullness
you shall proceed onwards from stage to stage
So what is the matter with them that they do not believe
and when the Qur an is recited to them they do not prostrate themselves
Instead the unbelievers reject it calling it a lie
Allah knows best what they are accumulating in their Record
So give them the good news of a painful chastisement
except for those who believe and do good deeds
Theirs shall be an unending reward
By the heaven with its impregnable castles
by the Promised Day
and by the witness and what is witnessed
the people of the pit were destroyed
with fire abounding in fuel
while they sat around it
and were witnessing what they did to the believers
Against these they had no grudge except that they believed in Allah the Most Mighty the Most Praiseworthy
to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth
Allah witnesses everything
Surely those who tormented the believing men and the believing women and then did not repent theirs shall be the chastisement of Hell and theirs shall be the chastisement of burning
As for those who believed and acted righteously theirs shall be Gardens beneath which rivers flow
That is the great triumph
Stern indeed is your Lord s punishment
He it is Who creates for the first time and He it is Who will create again
and He is the Ever Forgiving the Most Loving
– the Lord of the Glorious Throne
the Executor of what He wills
Has the story of the armies reached you
the armies of Pharaoh and Thamud
The unbelievers are indeed engaged in denying it calling it a lie
although Allah surrounds them
Nay but this is a glorious Qur an
inscribed on a wellguarded Tablet
By the heaven and the nightvisitor
what do you know what the nightvisitor is
It is the piercing star
There is no living being but there is a protector over it
So let man consider of what he was created
He was created of a gushing fluid
emanating from between the loins and the ribs
Surely He the Creator has the power to bring him back to life
On the Day when man s deepest secrets shall be put to the test
he shall have no power and no helper
By the heaven with its recurring cycle of rain
and by the earth ever bursting with verdure
this Qur an is surely a decisive Word
not a flippant jest
They are devising a guile
and I too am devising a guile
So leave the unbelievers to themselves respite them awhile
Glorify the name of your Lord the Most High
Who created all things and fashioned them in good proportion
Who determined and guided them
Who brought forth the pasture
and then made it into a blackish straw
We shall make you recite and then you will not forget
except what Allah should wish
He knows all that is manifest and all that is hidden
We shall ease you to follow the way of Ease
So render good counsel if good counsel will avail
He who fears Allah shall heed it
but the wretched will turn away from it
He will be cast into the Great Fire
Then he will neither die in it nor live
He who purified himself shall prosper
remembering his Lord s name and praying
No but you prefer the present life
whereas the Hereafter is better and more enduring
This indeed was in the ancient Scrolls
the Scrolls of Abraham and Moses
Has the news of the overwhelming event reached you
Some faces that Day shall be downcast with fear
be toiling and wornout
they shall burn in a Scorching Fire
their drink shall be from a boiling spring
They shall have no food except bitter dry thorns
that will neither nourish nor satisfy their hunger
On that very Day some faces shall be radiant with joy
wellpleased with their striving
They will be in a lofty Garden
wherein they shall hear no vain talk
In it there shall be a flowing spring
and couches raised high
and goblets laid out
and cushions arrayed in rows
and rich carpets levelled out
Do these unbelievers not observe the camels how they were created
And the sky how it was raised high
And the mountains how they were fixed
And the earth how it was spread out
So render good counsel for you are simply required to counsel
and are not invested with the authority to compel them
But whoever will turn away from the Truth
Allah will chastise him with the most terrible chastisement
Surely to Us is their return
and then it is for Us to call them to account
By the dawn
and the ten nights
and the even and the odd
and by the night when it departs
Is there in this an oath for one endowed with understanding
Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with Ad
of Iram known for their lofty columns
the like of whom no nation was ever created in the lands of the world
And how did He deal with Thamud who hewed out rocks in the valley
And with Pharaoh of the tent pegs
who transgressed in the countries of the world
spreading in them much corruption
Then their Lord unloosed upon them the lash of chastisement
Truly your Lord is ever watchful
As for man when his Lord tests him by exalting him and bestowing His bounties upon him he says “ My Lord has exalted me ”
But when He tests him by straitening his sustenance he says “ My Lord has humiliated me ”
But no you do not treat the orphan honourably
and do not urge one another to feed the poor
and greedily devour the entire inheritance
and love the riches loving them ardently
But no when the earth is ground to powder
and when your Lord appears with rows upon rows of angels
and when Hell is brought near that Day
On that Day will man understand but of what avail will that understanding be
He will say “ Would that I had sent ahead what would be of avail for this life of mine ”
Then on that Day Allah will chastise as none other can chastise
and Allah will bind as none other can bind
On the other hand it will be said “ O serene soul
Return to your Lord wellpleased with your blissful destination wellpleasing to your Lord
So enter among My righteous servants
and enter My Paradise ”
Nay I swear by this city
– this city wherein you have been rendered violable –
and I swear by the parent and his offspring
Verily We have created man into toil and hardship
Does he think that no one can overpower him
He says “ I have squandered enormous wealth ”
Does he believe that none has seen him
Did We not grant him two eyes
and a tongue and two lips
And did We not show him the two highroads of good and evil
But he did not venture to scale the difficult steep
And what do you know what that difficult steep is
It is freeing someone s neck from slavery
or giving food on a day of hunger
to an orphan near of kin
or to a destitute lying in dust
and then besides this he be one of those who believed and enjoined upon one another steadfastness and enjoined upon one another compassion
These are the People of the Right Hand
As for those who rejected Our Signs they are the People of the Left Hand
Upon them shall be a Fire that will hem them in
By the sun and its heat and brightness
and by the moon as it follows it
and by the day as it displays the sun s glory
and by the night as it envelopes the sun
and by the sky and by Him Who made it
and by the earth and by Him Who stretched it out
and by the soul and by Him Who perfectly proportioned it
and imbued it with the consciousness of its evil and its piety
He who purifies it will prosper
and he who suppresses it will be ruined
In their presumptuous insolence the Thamud called the Truth a lie
when their archcriminal rose up in rage
Then Allah s Messenger warned them “ Hands off the shecamel and her drink ”
But they rejected his statement as a lie and hamstrung the shecamel
For that crime their Lord rumbled down upon them utterly razing them to the ground
He has no fear of its sequel
By the night when it enshrouds
and by the day when it breaks in its glory
and by Him Who created the male and the female
surely your strivings are divergent
As for him who gave out his wealth for Allah s sake and abstained from disobeying Him
and affirmed the Truth of goodness
We shall facilitate for him the Way to Bliss
As for him who was a miser and behaved with aversion to Allah
and denied the Truth of goodness
We shall facilitate for him the way to Hardship
and his wealth shall be of no avail to him when he perishes
Surely it is for Us to show the Right Way
and to Us belong the Next Life and the present
I have now warned you of a Blazing Fire
where none shall burn except the most wicked
who rejected the Truth calling it falsehood and turned his back on it
But the Godfearing shall be kept away from it
the Godfearing who spends his wealth to purify himself
not as payment for any favours that he received
but only to seek the good pleasure of his Lord Most High
He will surely be wellpleased with him
By the bright forenoon
and by the night when it covers the world with peace
O Prophet your Lord has neither forsaken you nor is He displeased
Indeed what is to come will be better for you than what has gone by
Verily your Lord will soon give you so amply that you will be wellpleased
Did He not find you an orphan and then gave you shelter
Did He not find you unaware of the Right Way and then directed you to it
And did He not find you in want and then enriched you
Therefore be not harsh with the orphan
and chide not him who asks
and proclaim the bounty of your Lord
O Prophet Did We not lay open your breast
and relieve you of the burden
that had wellnigh broken your back
And did We not exalt your fame
Indeed there is ease with hardship
Most certainly there is ease with hardship
So whenever you are free strive in devotion
and turn to your Lord with longing
By the fig and the olive
and by the Mount Sinai
and by this city of Makkah a haven of peace
surely We created man in the best mould
then We reverted him to the lowest of the low
except those who have faith and do righteous deeds
Theirs is a never ending reward
Who then can give the lie to you O Prophet about the Reward and the Punishment
Is not Allah the Greatest of all sovereigns
Recite in the name of your Lord Who created
created man from a clot of congealed blood
Recite and your Lord is Most Generous
Who taught by the pen
taught man what he did not know
Nay surely man transgresses
for he believes himself to be selfsufficient
Surely to your Lord is your return
Did you see him who forbids
a servant of Allah when he prays
Did you consider what if he is on the Right Way
and enjoins piety
Did you consider what if he gives the lie to the Truth and turns away from it
Does he not know that Allah sees everything
No indeed if he does not desist We shall drag him by the forelock
by the lying forelock steeped in sin
So let him summon his helpmates
We too shall summon the guards of Hell
No not at all Never obey him
But prostrate yourself and become nigh to your Lord
Behold We revealed this Qur an on the Night of Power
And what do you know what the Night of Power is
The Night of Power is better than a thousand months
The angels along with the Spirit descend in it by the permission of their Lord with all kinds of decrees
All peace is that night until the rise of dawn
Those who disbelieved be they – from the People of the Book or from those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity – will not desist from unbelief until the Clear Proof should come to them
a Messenger from Allah reciting from Purified Scrolls
in writings wherein are scriptures absolutely true and unerring
Nor did those to whom the Book had been given split up until after the Proof of the Right Way had come to them
Yet all that they had been commanded was that they serve Allah with utter sincerity devoting themselves exclusively to Him and that they establish Prayer and pay Zakah
That is the Right Faith
Those who disbelieved be they – from among the People of the Book or among those who associated others with Allah in His Divinity – shall be in the Fire and will abide in it
They are the worst of creatures
But those that believe and work righteous deeds they are the best of creatures
Their recompense lies with their Lord Gardens of eternity beneath which rivers flow therein they shall dwell forever and ever
Allah is wellpleased with them and they are wellpleased with Him
All this is for him who fears his Lord
When the earth will be shaken with a mighty shaking
and the earth will throw up all her burdens
and man will cry out “ What is the matter with her ”
On that Day it will relate all her news
for your Lord will have commanded her to do so
On that Day people will go forth in varying states so that they be shown their deeds
So whoever does an atom s weight of good shall see it
and whoever does an atom s weight of evil shall see it
By the horses that charge snorting
then raise sparks of fire by their hoofs
then raid by the dawn
and blaze a trail of dust
and penetrate deep into a host
Verily man is most ungrateful to his Lord
and he himself is a witness to that
and surely he loves riches with a passionate loving
Is he not aware that when whatever lies buried in the graves is overthrown
and the secrets of the hearts are laid bare and examined
Surely on that Day will their Lord be fully informed about them
The Calamity
What is the Calamity
And what do you know what the Calamity is
On that Day human beings shall be like scattered moths
and the mountains shall be like fluffs of carded wool in varying colours
Then he whose scales weigh heavier
shall have a blissful life
but he whose scales weigh lighter
his shall be the deep pit for a dwelling
And what do you know what that is
A Blazing Fire
The craving for evergreater worldly gains and to excel others in that regard keeps you occupied
until you reach your graves
Nay you will soon come to know
nay again you shall soon come to know
Nay would that you knew with certainty of knowledge what your attitude will lead to you would never have acted the way you do
You will surely end up seeing Hell
again you shall most certainly end up seeing it with absolute certainty
Then on that Day you will be called to account for all the bounties you enjoyed
By the time
Lo Man is in a state of loss
save those who have faith and do righteous deeds and counsel each other to hold on to truth and counsel each other to be steadfast
Woe to every faultfinding backbiter
who amasses wealth and counts it over and again
He thinks that his wealth will immortalise him forever
Nay he shall be thrown into the Crusher
And what do you know what the Crusher is
It is the Fire kindled by Allah
the Fire that shall rise to the hearts of criminals
Verily it will close in upon them
in outstretched columns
Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephants
Did He not bring their plan to naught
And He sent against them swarms of birds
which smote them with stones of baked clay
and made them like straw eaten up by cattle
Since the Quraysh became accustomed
accustomed to the journey of winter and summer
therefore let them worship the Lord of this House
Who fed them against hunger and secured them against fear
Did you see him who gives the lie to the Reward and Punishment of the Hereafter
Such is the one who repulses the orphans away
and urges not the feeding of the needy
Woe then to those who pray
but are heedless in their Prayers
those who do good in order to be seen
and deny people the articles of common necessity
O Prophet We have surely bestowed upon you good in abundance
So offer Prayer and sacrifice to your Lord alone
Verily your enemy alone has been cut off from the roots
Say “ O unbelievers ”
I do not worship those that you worship
neither do you worship Him Whom I worship
nor will I worship those whom you have worshipped
nor are you going to worship Him Whom I worship
To you is your religion and to me my religion
When the help comes from Allah and victory is granted
and you see people entering Allah s religion in multitudes
then extol the praise of your Lord and pray to Him for forgiveness
For He indeed is ever disposed to accept repentance
Destroyed were the hands of Abu Lahab and he lay utterly doomed
His wealth did not avail him nor his acquisitions
Surely he will be cast into a Flaming Fire
along with his wife that carrier of slanderous tales
upon her neck shall be a rope of palmfibre
Say “ He is Allah the One and Unique
Allah Who is in need of none and of Whom all are in need
He neither begot any nor was He begotten
and none is comparable to Him ”
Say “ I seek refuge with the Lord of the rising day
from the evil of all that He created
from the evil of night s darkness when it spreads around
from the evil of the women who blow on knots
and from the evil of the envier when he envies ”
Say “ I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind
the King of mankind
the True God of mankind
from the mischief of the whispering elusive prompter who returns again and again
who whispers in the hearts of people
whether he be from the jinn or humans ”
Praise be to Allah Lord of the Worlds
The Beneficent the Merciful
Master of the Day of Judgment
Thee alone we worship Thee alone we ask for help
Show us the straight path
The path of those whom Thou hast favoured Not the path of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray
Alif
Lam
Mim
This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt a guidance unto those who ward off evil
Who believe in the Unseen and establish worship and spend of that We have bestowed upon them
And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee Muhammad and that which was revealed before thee and are certain of the Hereafter
These depend on guidance from their Lord
These are the successful
As for the Disbelievers Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them they believe not
Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts and on their eyes there is a covering
Theirs will be an awful doom
And of mankind are some who say We believe in Allah and the Last Day when they believe not
They think to beguile Allah and those who believe and they beguile none save themselves but they perceive not
In their hearts is a disease and Allah increaseth their disease
A painful doom is theirs because they lie
And when it is said unto them Make not mischief in the earth they say We are peacemakers only
Are not they indeed the mischiefmakers But they perceive not
And when it is said unto them believe as the people believe they say shall we believe as the foolish believe are not they indeed the foolish
But they know not
And when they fall in with those who believe they say We believe but when they go apart to their devils they declare Lo we are with you verily we did but mock
Allah Himself doth mock them leaving them to wander blindly on in their contumacy
These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance so their commerce doth not prosper neither are they guided
Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire and when it sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness where they cannot see
Deaf dumb and blind and they return not
Or like a rainstorm from the sky wherein is darkness thunder and the flash of lightning They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunderclaps for fear of death Allah encompasseth the disbelievers in His guidance His omniscience and His omnipotence
The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them
As often as it flasheth forth for them they walk therein and when it darkeneth against them they stand still
If Allah willed He could destroy their hearing and their sight
Lo Allah is able to do all things
O mankind worship your Lord Who hath created you and those before you so that ye may ward off evil
Who hath appointed the earth a restingplace for you and the sky a canopy and causeth water to pour down from the sky thereby producing fruits as food for you
And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know better
And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave Muhammad then produce a surah of the like thereof and call your witness beside Allah if ye are truthful
And if ye do it not and ye can never do it then guard yourselves against the Fire prepared for disbelievers whose fuel is of men and stones
And give glad tidings O Muhammad unto those who believe and do good works that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow as often as they are regaled with food of the fruit thereof they say this is what was given us aforetime and it is given to them in resemblance
There for them are pure companions there for ever they abide
Lo Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat
Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord but those who disbelieve say What doth Allah wish to teach by such a similitude
He misleadeth many thereby and He guideth many thereby and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it and sever that which Allah ordered to be joined and who make mischief in the earth Those are they who are the losers
How disbelieve ye in Allah when ye were dead and He gave life to you
Then He will give you death then life again and then unto Him ye will return
He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth Then turned He to the heaven and fashioned it as seven heavens
And He is knower of all things
And when thy Lord said unto the angels Lo I am about to place a viceroy in the earth they said Wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will shed blood while we we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee
He said Surely I know that which ye know not
And He taught Adam all the names then showed them to the angels saying Inform Me of the names of these if ye are truthful
They said Be glorified
We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast taught us Lo
Thou only Thou art the Knower the Wise
He said O Adam
Inform them of their names and when he had informed them of their names He said Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens and the earth And I know that which ye disclose and which ye hide
And when We said unto the angels Prostrate yourselves before Adam they fell prostrate all save Iblis
He demurred through pride and so became a disbeliever
And We said O Adam
Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and eat ye freely of the fruits thereof where ye will but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrongdoers
But Satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the happy state in which they were and We said Fall down one of you a foe unto the other
There shall be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a time
Then Adam received from his Lord words of revelation and He relented toward him
Lo He is the relenting the Merciful
We said Go down all of you from hence but verily there cometh unto you from Me a guidance and whoso followeth My guidance there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
But they who disbelieve and deny Our revelations such are rightful Peoples of the Fire
They will abide therein
O Children of Israel
Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and fulfil your part of the covenant I shall fulfil My part of the covenant and fear Me
And believe in that which I reveal confirming that which ye possess already of the Scripture and be not first to disbelieve therein and part not with My revelations for a trifling price and keep your duty unto Me
Confound not truth with falsehood nor knowingly conceal the truth
Establish worship pay the poordue and bow your heads with those who bow in worship
Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget to practise it And ye are readers of the Scripture
Have ye then no sense
Seek help in patience and prayer and truly it is hard save for the humbleminded
Who know that they will have to meet their Lord and that unto Him they are returning
O Children of Israel
Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to all creatures
And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another nor will intercession be accepted from it nor will compensation be received from it nor will they be helped
And remember when We did deliver you from Pharaoh s folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment slaying your sons and sparing your women that was a tremendous trial from your Lord
And when We brought you through the sea and rescued you and drowned the folk of Pharaoh in your sight
And when We did appoint for Moses forty nights of solitude and then ye chose the calf when he had gone from you and were wrongdoers
Then even after that We pardoned you in order that ye might give thanks
And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture and the criterion of right and wrong that ye might be led aright
And when Moses said unto his people O my people
Ye have wronged yourselves by your choosing of the calf for worship so turn in penitence to your Creator and kill the guilty yourselves
That will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent toward you Lo
He is the Relenting the Merciful
And when ye said O Moses
We will not believe in thee till we see Allah plainly and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you
Then We revived you after your extinction that ye might give thanks
And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you the manna and the quails saying Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you they wronged Us not but they did wrong themselves
And when We said Go into this township and eat freely of that which is therein and enter the gate prostrate and say Repentance
We will forgive you your sins and will increase reward for the rightdoers
But those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for another saying and We sent down upon the evildoers wrath from heaven for their evildoing
And when Moses asked for water for his people We said Smite with thy staff the rock
And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs so that each tribe knew their drinkingplace
Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided and do not act corruptly making mischief in the earth
And when ye said O Moses
We are weary of one kind of food so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions
He said Would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower
Go down to settled country thus ye shall get that which ye demand
And humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah
That was because they disbelieved in Allah s revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully
That was for their disobedience and transgression
Lo Those who believe in that which is revealed unto thee Muhammad and those who are Jews and Christians and Sabaeans whoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right surely their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
And remember O Children of Israel when We made a covenant with you and caused the mount to tower above you saying Hold fast that which We have given you and remember that which is therein that ye may ward off evil
Then even after that ye turned away and if it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers
And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath how We said unto them Be ye apes despised and hated
And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations and an admonition to the Allahfearing
And when Moses said unto his people Lo Allah commandeth you that ye sacrifice a cow they said Dost thou make game of us
He answered Allah forbid that I should be among the foolish
They said Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what cow she is
Moses answered Lo He saith Verily she is a cow neither with calf nor immature she is between the two conditions so do that which ye are commanded
They said Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what colour she is
Moses answered Lo He saith Verily she is a yellow cow
Bright is her colour gladdening beholders
They said Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what cow she is
Lo cows are much alike to us and Lo if Allah wills we may be led aright
Moses answered Lo He saith Verily she is a cow unyoked she plougheth not the soil nor watereth the tilth whole and without mark
They said Now thou bringest the truth
So they sacrificed her though almost they did not
And remember when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and Allah brought forth that which ye were hiding
And We said Smite him with some of it
Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His portents so that ye may understand
Then even after that your hearts were hardened and became as rocks or worse than rocks for hardness
For indeed there are rocks from out which rivers gush and indeed there are rocks which split asunder so that water floweth from them
And indeed there are rocks which fall down for the fear of Allah
Allah is not unaware of what ye do
Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them used to listen to the word of Allah then used to change it after they had understood it knowingly
And when they fall in with those who believe they say We believe But when they go apart one with another they say Prate ye to them of that which Allah hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you before your Lord concerning it
Have ye then no sense
Are they then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim
Among them are unlettered folk who know the Scripture not except from hearsay They but guess
Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and then say This is from Allah that they may purchase a small gain therewith
Woe unto them for that their hands have written and woe unto them for that they earn thereby
And they say The Fire of punishment will not touch us save for a certain number of days
Say Have ye received a covenant from Allah truly Allah will not break His covenant or tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not
Nay but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him such are rightful owners of the Fire they will abide therein
And those who believe and do good works such are rightful owners of the Garden
They will abide therein
And remember when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel saying Worship none save Allah only and be good to parents and to kindred and to orphans and the needy and speak kindly to mankind and establish worship and pay the poordue
Then after that ye slid back save a few of you being averse
And when We made with you a covenant saying Shed not the blood of your people nor turn a party of your people out of your dwellings
Then ye ratified Our covenant and ye were witnesses thereto
Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes supporting one another against them by sin and transgression and if they came to you as captives ye would ransom them whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof
And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom
For Allah is not unaware of what ye do
Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter
Their punishment will not be lightened neither will they have support
And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of messengers to follow after him and We gave unto Jesus son of Mary clear proofs of Allah s sovereignty and We supported him with the Holy spirit
Is it ever so that when there cometh unto you a messenger from Allah with that which ye yourselves desire not ye grow arrogant and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay
And they say Our hearts are hardened
Nay but Allah hath cursed them for their unbelief
Little is that which they believe
And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah confirming that in their possession though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those who disbelieved and when there cometh unto them that which they know to be the truth they disbelieve therein
The curse of Allah is on disbelievers
Evil is that for which they sell their souls that they should disbelieve in that which Allah hath revealed grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His slaves
They have incurred anger upon anger
For disbelievers is a shameful doom
And when it is said unto them Believe in that which Allah hath revealed they say We believe in that which was revealed unto us
And they disbelieve in that which cometh after it though it is the truth confirming that which they possess
Say unto them O Muhammad Why then slew ye the prophets of Allah aforetime if ye are indeed believers
And Moses came unto you with clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty yet while he was away ye chose the calf for worship and ye were wrongdoers
And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you saying Hold fast by that which We have given you and hear Our Word they said We hear and we rebel
And worship of the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection of the covenant
Say unto them Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you if ye are believers
Say unto them If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of Allah is indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind as ye pretend then long for death for ye must long for death if ye are truthful
But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them
Allah is aware of evildoers
And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and greedier than the idolaters
Each one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years
And to live a thousand years would be no means remove him from the doom
Allah is Seer of what they do
Say O Muhammad to mankind Who is an enemy to Gabriel For he it is who hath revealed this Scripture to thy heart by Allah s leave confirming that which was revealed before it and a guidance and glad tidings to believers
Who is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael Then lo
Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens and only miscreants will disbelieve in them
Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it aside
The truth is most of them believe not
And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah confirming that which they possess a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they knew not
And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon
Solomon disbelieved not but the devils disbelieved teaching mankind magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel Harut and Marut
Nor did they the two angels teach it to anyone till they had said We are only a temptation therefore disbelieve not in the guidance of Allah
And from these two angles people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife but they injure thereby noone save by Allah s leave
And they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not
And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no happy portion in the Hereafter and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls if they but knew
And if they had believed and kept from evil a recompense from Allah would be better if they only knew
O ye who believe say not unto the Prophet Listen to us but say Look upon us and be ye listeners
For disbelievers is a painful doom
Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor the idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your Lord
But Allah chooseth for His mercy whom He will and Allah is of Infinite Bounty
Nothing of our revelation even a single verse do we abrogate or cause be forgotten but we bring in place one better or the like thereof
Knowest thou not that Allah is Able to do all things
Knowest thou not that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and ye have not beside Allah any guardian or helper
Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime
He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith verily he hath gone astray from a plain road
Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief through envy on their own account after the truth hath become manifest unto them
Forgive and be indulgent toward them until Allah give command
Lo Allah is Able to do all things
Establish worship and pay the poordue and whatever of good ye send before you for your souls ye will find it with Allah Lo
Allah is Seer of what ye do
And they say None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian
These are their own desires
Say Bring your proof of what ye state if ye are truthful
Nay but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good his reward is with his Lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing true and the Christians say the Jews follow nothing true yet both are readers of the Scripture
Even thus speak those who know not
Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ
And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the sanctuaries of Allah lest His name should be mentioned therein and striveth for their ruin
As for such it was never meant that they should enter them except in fear
Theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom
Unto Allah belong the East and the West and whithersoever ye turn there is Allah s Countenance Lo
Allah is AllEmbracing AllKnowing
And they say Allah hath taken unto Himself a son
Be He glorified
Nay but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His
All are subservient unto Him
The Originator of the heavens and the earth
When He decreeth a thing He saith unto it only Be and it is
And those who have no knowledge say Why doth not Allah speak unto us or some sign come unto us
Even thus as they now speak spake those who were before them
Their hearts are all alike
We have made clear the revelations for people who are sure
Lo We have sent thee O Muhammad with the truth a bringer of glad tidings and a warner
And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hellfire
And the Jews will not be pleased with thee nor will the Christians till thou follow their creed
Say Lo the guidance of Allah Himself is Guidance
And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee then wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting guardian nor helper
Those unto whom We have given the Scripture who read it with the right reading those believe in it
And whoso disbelieveth in it those are they who are the losers
O Children of Israel
Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to all creatures
And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another nor will compensation be accepted from it nor will intercession be of use to it nor will they be helped
And remember when his Lord tried Abraham with His commands and he fulfilled them He said Lo
I have appointed thee a leader for mankind
Abraham said And of my offspring will there be leaders
He said My covenant includeth not wrongdoers
And when We made the House at Makka a resort for mankind and sanctuary saying Take as your place of worship the place where Abraham stood to pray
And We imposed a duty upon Abraham and Ishmael saying Purify My house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who bow down and prostrate themselves in worship
And when Abraham prayed My Lord
Make this a region of security and bestow upon its people fruits such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day He answered As for him who disbelieveth I shall leave him in contentment for a while then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire a hapless journey s end
And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House Abraham prayed Our Lord
Accept from us this duty
Lo Thou only Thou art the Hearer the Knower
Our Lord
And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee and show us our ways of worship and relent toward us Lo
Thou only Thou art the Relenting the Merciful
Our Lord
And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who shall recite unto them Thy revelations and shall instruct them in the Scripture and in wisdom and shall make them grow
Lo Thou only Thou art the Mighty Wise
And who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth himself
Verily We chose him in the world and lo in the Hereafter he is among the righteous
When his Lord said unto him Surrender he said I have surrendered to the Lord of the Worlds
The same did Abraham enjoin upon his sons and also Jacob saying O my sons
Lo Allah hath chosen for you the true religion therefore die not save as men who have surrendered unto Him
Or were ye present when death came to Jacob when he said unto his sons What will ye worship after me
They said We shall worship thy god the god of thy fathers Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac One Allah and unto Him we have surrendered
Those are a people who have passed away
Theirs is that which they earned and yours is that which ye earn
And ye will not be asked of what they used to do
And they say Be Jews or Christians then ye will be rightly guided
Say unto them O Muhammad Nay but we follow the religion of Abraham the upright and he was not of the idolaters
Say O Muslims We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes and that which Moses and Jesus received and that which the prophets received from their Lord
We make no distinction between any of them and unto Him we have surrendered
And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe then are they rightly guided
But if they turn away then are they in schism and Allah will suffice thee for defence against them
He is the Hearer the Knower
We take our colour from Allah and who is better than Allah at colouring
We are His worshippers
Say unto the People of the Scripture Dispute ye with us concerning Allah when He is our Lord and your Lord
Ours are our works and yours your works
We look to Him alone
Or say ye that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes were Jews or Christians
Say Do ye know best or doth Allah
And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah
Allah is not unaware of what ye do
Those are a people who have passed away theirs is that which they earned and yours that which ye earn
And ye will not be asked of what they used to do
The foolish of the people will say What hath turned them from the qiblah which they formerly observed
Say Unto Allah belong the East and the West
He guideth whom He will unto a straight path
Thus We have appointed you a middle nation that ye may be witnesses against mankind and that the messenger may be a witness against you
And We appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who followeth the messenger from him who turneth on his heels
In truth it was a hard test save for those whom Allah guided
But it was not Allah s purpose that your faith should be in vain for Allah is Full of Pity Merciful toward mankind
We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven for guidance O Muhammad And now verily We shall make thee turn in prayer toward a qiblah which is dear to thee
So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship and ye O Muslims wheresoever ye may be turn your faces when ye pray toward it Lo
Those who have received the Scripture know that this revelation is the Truth from their Lord
And Allah is not unaware of what they do
And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all kinds of portents they would not follow thy qiblah nor canst thou be a follower of their qiblah nor are some of them followers of the qiblah of others
And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee then surely wert thou of the evildoers
Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise this revelation as they recognise their sons
But lo a party of them knowingly conceal the truth
It is the Truth from thy Lord O Muhammad so be not thou of those who waver
And each one hath a goal toward which he turneth so vie with one another in good works
Wheresoever ye may be Allah will bring you all together
Lo Allah is Able to do all things
And whencesoever thou comest forth for prayer O Muhammad turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship
Lo it is the Truth from thy Lord
Allah is not unaware of what ye do
Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship and wheresoever ye may be O Muslims turn your faces toward it when ye pray so that men may have no argument against you save such of them as do injustice Fear them not but fear Me and so that I may complete My grace upon you and that ye may be guided
Even as We have sent unto you a messenger from among you who reciteth unto you Our revelations and causeth you to grow and teacheth you the Scripture and wisdom and teacheth you that which ye knew not
Therefore remember Me I will remember you
Give thanks to Me and reject not Me
O ye who believe
Seek help in steadfastness and prayer Lo
Allah is with the steadfast
And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah dead
Nay they are living only ye perceive not
And surely We shall try you with something of fear and hunger and loss of wealth and lives and crops but give glad tidings to the steadfast
Who say when a misfortune striketh them Lo we are Allah s and lo unto Him we are returning
Such are they on whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy
Such are the rightly guided
Lo the mountains AsSafa and AlMarwah are among the indications of Allah
It is therefore no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the House of Allah or visiteth it to go around them as the pagan custom is
And he who doeth good of his own accord for him lo Allah is Responsive Aware
Lo Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed after We had made it clear to mankind in the Scripture such are accursed of Allah and accursed of those who have the power to curse
Except those who repent and amend and make manifest the truth
These it is toward whom I relent
I am the Relenting the Merciful
Lo Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers on them is the curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined
They ever dwell therein
The doom will not be lightened for them neither will they be reprieved
Your Allah is One Allah there is no Allah save Him the Beneficent the Merciful
Lo In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the difference of night and day and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men and the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky thereby reviving the earth after its death and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein and in the ordinance of the winds and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth are signs of Allah s Sovereignty for people who have sense
Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves objects of worship which they set as rivals to Allah loving them with a love like that which is the due of Allah only those who believe are stauncher in their love for Allah Oh that those who do evil had but known on the day when they behold the doom that power belongeth wholly to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment
On the day when those who were followed disown those who followed them and they behold the doom and all their aims collapse with them
And those who were but followers will say If a return were possible for us we would disown them even as they have disowned us
Thus will Allah show them their own deeds as anguish for them and they will not emerge from the Fire
O mankind
Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth and follow not the footsteps of the devil
Lo he is an open enemy for you
He enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul and that ye should tell concerning Allah that which ye know not
And when it is said unto them Follow that which Allah hath revealed they say We follow that wherein we found our fathers What
Even though their fathers were wholly unintelligent and had no guidance
The likeness of those who disbelieve in relation to the messenger is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught except a shout and cry
Deaf dumb blind therefore they have no sense
O ye who believe
Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you and render thanks to Allah if it is indeed He Whom ye worship
He hath forbidden you only carrion and blood and swineflesh and that which hath been immolated to the name of any other than Allah
But he who is driven by necessity neither craving nor transgressing it is no sin for him
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Lo those who hide aught of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed and purchase a small gain therewith they eat into their bellies nothing else than fire
Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He make them grow
Theirs will be a painful doom
Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance and torment at the price of pardon
How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire
That is because Allah hath revealed the Scripture with the truth
Lo those who find a cause of disagreement in the Scripture are in open schism
It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West but righteous is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Scripture and the prophets and giveth wealth for love of Him to kinsfolk and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask and to set slaves free and observeth proper worship and payeth the poordue And those who keep their treaty when they make one and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of stress
Such are they who are sincere
Such are the Allahfearing
O ye who believe
Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered the freeman for the freeman and the slave for the slave and the female for the female
And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his injured brother prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness
This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord
He who transgresseth after this will have a painful doom
And there is life for you in retaliation O men of understanding that ye may ward off evil
It is prescribed for you when death approacheth one of you if he leave wealth that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in kindness
This is a duty for all those who ward off evil
And whoso changeth the will after he hath heard it the sin thereof is only upon those who change it
Lo Allah is Hearer Knower
But he who feareth from a testator some unjust or sinful clause and maketh peace between the parties it shall be no sin for him
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O ye who believe
Fasting is prescribed for you even as it was prescribed for those before you that ye may ward off evil
Fast a certain number of days and for him who is sick among you or on a journey the same number of other days and for those who can afford it there is a ransom the feeding of a man in need but whoso doeth good of his own accord it is better for him and that ye fast is better for you if ye did but know
The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur an a guidance for mankind and clear proofs of the guidance and the Criterion of right and wrong
And whosoever of you is present let him fast the month and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey let him fast the same number of other days
Allah desireth for you ease He desireth not hardship for you and He desireth that ye should complete the period and that ye should magnify Allah for having guided you and that peradventure ye may be thankful
And when My servants question thee concerning Me then surely I am nigh I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he crieth unto Me
So let them hear My call and let them trust in Me in order that they may be led aright
It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast
They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them
Allah is Aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath turned in mercy toward you and relieved you
So hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn
Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch them not but be at your devotions in the mosques
These are the limits imposed by Allah so approach them not
Thus Allah expoundeth His revelation to mankind that they may ward off evil
And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity nor seek by it to gain the hearing of the judges that ye may knowingly devour a portion of the property of others wrongfully
They ask thee O Muhammad of new moons say They are fixed seasons for mankind and for the pilgrimage
It is not righteousness that ye go to houses by the backs thereof as do the idolaters at certain seasons but the righteous man is he who wardeth off evil
So go to houses by the gates thereof and observe your duty to Allah that ye may be successful
Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you but begin not hostilities
Lo Allah loveth not aggressors
And slay them wherever ye find them and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out for persecution is worse than slaughter
And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there but if they attack you there then slay them
Such is the reward of disbelievers
But if they desist then lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And fight them until persecution is no more and religion is for Allah
But if they desist then let there be no hostility except against wrongdoers
The forbidden month for the forbidden month and forbidden things in retaliation
And one who attacketh you attack him in like manner as he attacked you
Observe your duty to Allah and know that Allah is with those who ward off evil
Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah and be not cast by your own hands to ruin and do good
Lo
Allah loveth the beneficent
Perform the pilgrimage and the visit to Makka for Allah
And if ye are prevented then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease and shave not your heads until the gifts have reached their destination
And whoever among you is sick or hath an ailment of the head must pay a ransom of fasting or almsgiving or offering
And if ye are in safety then whosoever contenteth himself with the visit for the pilgrimage shall give such gifts as can be had with ease
And whosoever cannot find such gifts then a fast of three days while on the pilgrimage and of seven when ye have returned that is ten in all
That is for him whoso folk are not present at the Inviolable Place of Worship
Observe your duty to Allah and know that Allah is severe in punishment
The pilgrimage is in the wellknown months and whoever is minded to perform the pilgrimage therein let him remember that there is to be no lewdness nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage
And whatsoever good ye do Allah knoweth it
So make provision for yourselves Hereafter for the best provision is to ward off evil
Therefore keep your duty unto Me O men of understanding
It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord by trading
But when ye press on in the multitude from Arafat remember Allah by the sacred monument
Remember Him as He hath guided you although before ye were of those astray
Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward and ask forgiveness of Allah Lo
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And when ye have completed your devotions then remember Allah as ye remember your fathers or with a more lively remembrance
But of mankind is he who saith Our Lord
Give unto us in the world and he hath no portion in the Hereafter
And of them also is he who saith Our Lord
Give unto us in the world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good and guard us from the doom of Fire
For them there is in store a goodly portion out of that which they have earned
Allah is swift at reckoning
Remember Allah through the appointed days
Then whoso hasteneth his departure by two days it is no sin for him and whoso delayeth it is no sin for him that is for him who wardeth off evil
Be careful of your duty to Allah and know that unto Him ye will be gathered
And of mankind there is he whoso conversation on the life of this world pleaseth thee Muhammad and he calleth Allah to witness as to that which is in his heart yet he is the most rigid of opponents
And when he turneth away from thee his effort in the land is to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle and Allah loveth not mischief
And when it is said unto him Be careful of thy duty to Allah pride taketh him to sin
Hell will settle his account an evil restingplace
And of mankind is he who would sell himself seeking the pleasure of Allah and Allah hath compassion on His bondmen
O ye who believe
Come all of you into submission unto Him and follow not the footsteps of the devil
Lo he is an open enemy for you
And if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you then know that Allah is Mighty Wise
Wait they for naught else than that Allah should come unto them in the shadows of the clouds with the angels Then the case would be already judged
All cases go back to Allah for judgment
Ask of the Children of Israel how many a clear revelation We gave them
He who altereth the grace of Allah after it hath come unto him for him lo Allah is severe in punishment
Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve they make a jest of the believers
But those who keep their duty to Allah will be above them on the Day of Resurrection
Allah giveth without stint to whom He will
Mankind were one community and Allah sent unto them prophets as bearers of good tidings and as warners and revealed therewith the Scripture with the truth that it might judge between mankind concerning that wherein they differed
And only those unto whom the Scripture was given differed concerning it after clear proofs had come unto them through hatred one of another
And Allah by His Will guided those who believe unto the truth of that concerning which they differed
Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path
Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come unto you the like of that which came to those who passed away before you
Affliction and adversity befell them they were shaken as with earthquake till the messenger of Allah and those who believed along with him said When cometh Allah s help
Now surely Allah s help is nigh
They ask thee O Muhammad what they shall spend
Say that which ye spend for good must go to parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer
And whatsoever good ye do lo Allah is Aware of it
Warfare is ordained for you though it is hateful unto you but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you
Allah knoweth ye know not
They question thee O Muhammad with regard to warfare in the sacred month
Say Warfare therein is a great transgression but to turn men from the way of Allah and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship and to expel His people thence is a greater with Allah for persecution is worse than killing
And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion if they can
And whoso becometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter
Such are rightful owners of the Fire they will abide therein
Lo those who believe and those who emigrate to escape the persecution and strive in the way of Allah these have hope of Allah s mercy
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
They question thee about strong drink and games of chance
Say In both is great sin and some utility for men but the sin of them is greater than their usefulness
And they ask thee what they ought to spend
Say that which is superfluous
Thus Allah maketh plain to you His revelations that haply ye may reflect
Upon the world and the Hereafter
And they question thee concerning orphans
Say To improve their lot is best
And if ye mingle your affairs with theirs then they are your brothers
Allah knoweth him who spoileth from him who improveth
Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you
Allah is Mighty Wise
Wed not idolatresses till they believe for lo a believing bondwoman is better than an idolatress though she please you and give not your daughters in marriage to idolaters till they believe for lo a believing slave is better than an idolater though he please you These invite unto the Fire and Allah inviteth unto the Garden and unto forgiveness by His grace and expoundeth His revelations to mankind that haply they may remember
They question thee O Muhammad concerning menstruation
Say It is an illness so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are cleansed
And when they have purified themselves then go in unto them as Allah hath enjoined upon you
Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him and loveth those who have a care for cleanness
Your women are a tilth for you to cultivate so go to your tilth as ye will and send good deeds before you for your souls and fear Allah and know that ye will one day meet Him Give glad tidings to believers O Muhammad
And make not Allah by your oaths a hindrance to your being righteous and observing your duty unto Him and making peace among mankind
Allah is Hearer Knower
Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered
Allah is Forgiving Clement
Those who forswear their wives must wait four months then if they change their mind lo
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And if they decide upon divorce let them remember that Allah is Hearer Knower
Women who are divorced shall wait keeping themselves apart three monthly courses
And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal that which Allah hath created in their wombs if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day
And their husbands would do better to take them back in that case if they desire a reconciliation
And they women have rights similar to those of men over them in kindness and men are a degree above them
Allah is Mighty Wise
Divorce must be pronounced twice and then a woman must be retained in honour or released in kindness
And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them except in the case when both fear that they may not be able to keep within the limits imposed by Allah
And if ye fear that they may not be able to keep the limits of Allah in that case it is no sin for either of them if the woman ransom herself
These are the limits imposed by Allah Transgress them not
For whoso transgresseth Allah s limits such are wrongdoers
And if he hath divorced her the third time then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she hath wedded another husband
Then if he the other husband divorce her it is no sin for both of them that they come together again if they consider that they are able to observe the limits of Allah
These are the limits of Allah He manifesteth them for people who have knowledge
When ye have divorced women and they have reached their term then retain them in kindness or release them in kindness
Retain them not to their hurt so that ye transgress the limits
He who doeth that hath wronged his soul
Make not the revelations of Allah a laughingstock by your behaviour but remember Allah s grace upon you and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture and of wisdom whereby He doth exhort you
Observe your duty to Allah and know that Allah is Aware of all things
And when ye have divorced women and they reach their term place not difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between them in kindness
This is an admonition for him among you who believeth in Allah and the Last Day
That is more virtuous for you and cleaner
Allah knoweth ye know not
Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years that is for those who wish to complete the suckling
The duty of feeding and clothing nursing mothers in a seemly manner is upon the father of the child
Noone should be charged beyond his capacity
A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child nor should he to whom the child is born be made to suffer because of his child
And on the father s heir is incumbent the like of that which was incumbent on the father
If they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and after consultation it is no sin for them and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse it is no sin for you provide that ye pay what is due from you in kindness
Observe your duty to Allah and know that Allah is Seer of what ye do
Such of you as die and leave behind them wives they the wives shall wait keeping themselves apart four months and ten days
And when they reach the term prescribed for them then there is no sin for you in aught that they may do with themselves in decency
Allah is informed of what ye do
There is no sin for you in that which ye proclaim or hide in your minds concerning your troth with women
Allah knoweth that ye will remember them
But plight not your troth with women except by uttering a recognised form of words
And do not consummate the marriage until the term prescribed is run
Know that Allah knoweth what is in your minds so beware of Him and know that Allah is Forgiving Clement
It is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not touched them nor appointed unto them a portion
Provide for them the rich according to his means and the straitened according to his means a fair provision
This is a bounden duty for those who do good
If ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed unto them a portion then pay the half of that which ye appointed unless they the women agree to forgo it or he agreeth to forgo it in whose hand is the marriage tie
To forgo is nearer to piety
And forget not kindness among yourselves
Allah is Seer of what ye do
Be guardians of your prayers and of the midmost prayer and stand up with devotion to Allah
And if ye go in fear then pray standing or on horseback
And when ye are again in safety remember Allah as He hath taught you that which heretofore ye knew not
In the case of those of you who are about to die and leave behind them wives they should bequeath unto their wives a provision for the year without turning them out but if they go out of their own accord there is no sin for you in that which they do of themselves within their rights
Allah is Mighty Wise
For divorced women a provision in kindness a duty for those who ward off evil
Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations so that ye may understand
Bethink thee O Muhammad of those of old who went forth from their habitations in their thousands fearing death and Allah said unto them Die and then He brought them back to life
Lo
Allah is a Lord of Kindness to mankind but most of mankind give not thanks
Fight in the way of Allah and know that Allah is Hearer Knower
Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan so that He may give it increase manifold
Allah straiteneth and enlargeth
Unto Him ye will return
Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses how they said unto a prophet whom they had Set up for us a king and we will fight in Allah s way
He said Would ye then refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you
They said Why should we not fight in Allah s way when we have been driven from our dwellings with our children
Yet when fighting was prescribed for them they turned away all save a few of them
Allah is aware of evildoers
Their Prophet said unto them Lo Allah hath raised up Saul to be a king for you
They said How can he have kingdom over us when we are more deserving of the kingdom than he is since he hath not been given wealth enough He said Lo
Allah hath chosen him above you and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom and stature
Allah bestoweth His Sovereignty on whom He will
Allah is AllEmbracing AllKnowing
And their Prophet said unto them Lo the token of his kingdom is that there shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of reassurance from your Lord and a remnant of that which the house of Moses and the house of Aaron left behind the angels bearing it
Lo herein shall be a token for you if in truth ye are believers
And when Saul set out with the army he said Lo Allah will try you by the ordeal of a river
Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is not of me and whosoever tasteth it not he is of me save him who taketh thereof in the hollow of his hand
But they drank thereof all save a few of them
And after he had crossed the river he and those who believed with him they said We have no power this day against Goliath and his hosts
But those who knew that they would meet Allah exclaimed How many a little company hath overcome a mighty host by Allah s leave
Allah is with the steadfast
And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they said Our Lord
Bestow on us endurance make our foothold sure and give us help against the disbelieving folk
So they routed them by Allah s leave and David slew Goliath and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom and taught him of that which He willeth
And if Allah had not repelled some men by others the earth would have been corrupted
But Allah is a Lord of Kindness to His creatures
These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee Muhammad with truth and lo thou art of the number of Our messengers
Of those messengers some of whom We have caused to excel others and of whom there are some unto whom Allah spake while some of them He exalted above others in degree and We gave Jesus son of Mary clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty and We supported him with the holy Spirit
And if Allah had so wiled it those who followed after them would not have fought one with another after the clear proofs had come unto them
But they differed some of them believing and some disbelieving
And if Allah had so willed it they would not have fought one with another but Allah doeth what He will
O ye who believe spend of that wherewith We have provided you ere a day come when there will be no trafficking nor friendship nor intercession
The disbelievers they are the wrongdoers
Allah There is no deity save Him the Alive the Eternal
Neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him
Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave
He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will
His throne includeth the heavens and the earth and He is never weary of preserving them
He is the Sublime the Tremendous
There is no compulsion in religion
The right direction is henceforth distinct from error
And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah hath grasped a firm handhold which will never break
Allah is Hearer Knower
Allah is the Protecting Guardian of those who believe He bringeth them out of darkness into light
As for those who disbelieve their patrons are false deities They bring them out of light into darkness
Such are rightful owners of the Fire They will abide therein
Bethink thee of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord because Allah had given him the kingdom how when Abraham said My Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death he answered I give life and cause death Abraham said Lo
Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East so do thou cause it to come up from the West Thus was the disbeliever abashed
And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
Or bethink thee of the like of him who passing by a township which had fallen into utter ruin exclaimed How shall Allah give this township life after its death
And Allah made him die a hundred years then brought him back to life
He said How long hast thou tarried
The man said I have tarried a day or part of a day
He said Nay but thou hast tarried for a hundred years
Just look at thy food and drink which have not rotted Look at thine ass
And that We may make thee a token unto mankind look at the bones how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh
And when the matter became clear unto him he said I know now that Allah is Able to do all things
And when Abraham said unto his Lord My Lord
Show me how Thou givest life to the dead He said Dost thou not believe
Abraham said Yea but I ask in order that my heart may be at ease
His Lord said Take four of the birds and cause them to incline unto thee then place a part of them on each hill then call them they will come to thee in haste and know that Allah is Mighty Wise
The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah s way is as the likeness of a grain which groweth seven ears in every ear a hundred grains
Allah giveth increase manifold to whom He will
Allah is AllEmbracing AllKnowing
Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah and afterward make not reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
A kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by injury
Allah is Absolute Clement
O ye who believe
Render not vain your almsgiving by reproach and injury like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men and believeth not in Allah and the Last Day
His likeness is as the likeness of a rock whereon is dust of earth a rainstorm smiteth it leaving it smooth and bare
They have no control of aught of that which they have gained
Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk
And the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of Allah s pleasure and for the strengthening of their souls is as the likeness of a garden on a height The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold
And if the rainstorm smite it not then the shower
Allah is Seer of what ye do
Would any of you like to have a garden of palmtrees and vines with rivers flowing underneath it with all kinds of fruit for him therein and old age hath stricken him and he hath feeble offspring and a fiery whirlwind striketh it and it is all consumed by fire
Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations unto you in order that ye may give thought
O ye who believe
Spend of the good things which ye have earned and of that which We bring forth from the earth for you and seek not the bad with intent to spend thereof in charity when ye would not take it for yourselves save with disdain and know that Allah is Absolute Owner of Praise
The devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on you lewdness
But Allah promiseth you forgiveness from Himself with bounty
Allah is AllEmbracing Allknowing
He giveth wisdom unto whom He will and he unto whom wisdom is given he truly hath received abundant good
But none remember except men of understanding
Whatever alms ye spend or vow ye vow lo Allah knoweth it
Wrongdoers have no helpers
If ye publish your almsgiving it is well but if ye hide it and give it to the poor it will be better for you and will atone for some of your illdeeds
Allah is Informed of what ye do
The guiding of them is not thy duty O Muhammad but Allah guideth whom He will And whatsoever good thing ye spend it is for yourselves when ye spend not save in search of Allah s Countenance and whatsoever good thing ye spend it will be repaid to you in full and ye will not be wronged
Alms are for the poor who are straitened for the cause of Allah who cannot travel in the land for trade
The unthinking man accounteth them wealthy because of their restraint
Thou shalt know them by their mark They do not beg of men with importunity
And whatsoever good thing ye spend lo Allah knoweth it
Those who spend their wealth by night and day by stealth and openly verily their reward is with their Lord and their shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the devil hath prostrated by his touch
That is because they say Trade is just like usury whereas Allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth usury
He unto whom an admonition from his Lord cometh and he refraineth in obedience thereto he shall keep the profits of that which is past and his affair henceforth is with Allah
As for him who returneth to usury Such are rightful owners of the Fire
They will abide therein
Allah hath blighted usury and made almsgiving fruitful
Allah loveth not the impious and guilty
Lo those who believe and do good works and establish worship and pay the poordue their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
O ye who believe
Observe your duty to Allah and give up what remaineth due to you from usury if ye are in truth believers
And if ye do not then be warned of war against you from Allah and His messenger
And if ye repent then ye have your principal without interest
Wrong not and ye shall not be wronged
And if the debtor is in straitened circumstances then let there be postponement to the time of ease and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be better for you if ye did but know
And guard yourselves against a day in which ye will be brought back to Allah
Then every soul will be paid in full that which it hath earned and they will not be wronged
O ye who believe
When ye contract a debt for a fixed term record it in writing
Let a scribe record it in writing between you in terms of equity
No scribe should refuse to write as Allah hath taught him so let him write and let him who incurreth the debt dictate and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord and diminish naught thereof
But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding or weak or unable himself to dictate then let the guardian of his interests dictate in terms of equity
And call to witness from among your men two witnesses
And if two men be not at hand then a man and two women of such as ye approve as witnesses so that if the one erreth through forgetfulness the other will remember
And the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned
Be not averse to writing down the contract whether it be small or great with record of the term thereof
That is more equitable in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony and the best way of avoiding doubt between you save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand
In that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not
And have witnesses when ye sell one to another and let no harm be done to scribe or witness
If ye do harm to them lo it is a sin in you
Observe your duty to Allah Allah is teaching you
And Allah is knower of all things
If ye be on a journey and cannot find a scribe then a pledge in hand shall suffice
And if one of you entrusteth to another let him who is trusted deliver up that which is entrusted to him according to the pact between them and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord
Hide not testimony
He who hideth it verily his heart is sinful
Allah is Aware of what ye do
Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide it Allah will bring you to account for it
He will forgive whom He will and He will punish whom He will
Allah is Able to do all things
The messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his Lord and so do believers
Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers We make no distinction between any of His messengers and they say We hear and we obey
Grant us Thy forgiveness our Lord
Unto Thee is the journeying
Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope
For it is only that which it hath earned and against it only that which it hath deserved
Our Lord Condemn us not if we forget or miss the mark
Our Lord Lay not on us such a burden as thou didst lay on those before us
Our Lord Impose not on us that which we have not the strength to bear
Pardon us absolve us and have mercy on us Thou our Protector and give us victory over the disbelieving folk
Alim
Lam
Mim
Allah
There is no god save Him the Alive the Eternal
He hath revealed unto thee Muhammad the Scripture with truth confirming that which was revealed before it even as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel
Aforetime for a guidance to mankind and hath revealed the Criterion of right and wrong
Lo those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah theirs will be a heavy doom
Allah is Mighty Able to Requite the wrong
Lo nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah
He it is Who fashioneth you in the wombs as pleaseth Him
There is no Allah save Him the Almighty the Wise
He it is Who hath revealed unto thee Muhammad the Scripture wherein are clear revelations they are the substance of the Book and others which are allegorical
But those in whose hearts is doubt pursue forsooth that which is allegorical seeking to cause dissension by seeking to explain it
None knoweth its explanation save Allah
And those who are of sound instruction say We believe therein the whole is from our Lord but only men of understanding really heed
Our Lord
Cause not our hearts to stray after Thou hast guided us and bestow upon us mercy from Thy Presence Lo
Thou only Thou art the Bestower
Our Lord
Lo it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together to a Day of which there is no doubt Lo
Allah faileth not to keep the tryst
On that Day neither the riches nor the progeny of those who disbelieve will aught avail them with Allah
They will be fuel for Fire
Like Pharaoh s folk and those who were before them they disbelieved Our revelations and so Allah seized them for their sins
And Allah is severe in punishment
Say O Muhammad unto those who disbelieve Ye shall be overcome and gathered unto Hell an evil restingplace
There was a token for you in two hosts which met one army fighting in the way of Allah and another disbelieving whom they saw as twice their number clearly with their very eyes
Thus Allah strengtheneth with His succour whom He will
Lo herein verily is a lesson for those who have eyes
Beautified for mankind is love of the joys that come from women and offspring and storedup heaps of gold and silver and horses branded with their mark and cattle and land That is comfort of the life of the world
Allah With Him is a more excellent abode
Say Shall I inform you of something better than that
For those who keep from evil with their Lord are Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide and pure companions and contentment from Allah
Allah is Seer of His bondmen
Those who say Our Lord
Lo we believe So forgive us our sins and guard us from the punishment of Fire
The steadfast and the truthful and the obedient those who spend and hoard not those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night
Allah Himself is Witness that there is no Allah save Him
And the angels and the men of learning too are witness
Maintaining His creation in justice there is no Allah save Him the Almighty the Wise
Lo religion with Allah is the Surrender to His Will and Guidance
Those who formerly received the Scripture differed only after knowledge came unto them through transgression among themselves
Whoso disbelieveth the revelations of Allah will find that lo Allah is swift at reckoning
And if they argue with thee O Muhammad say I have surrendered my purpose to Allah and so have those who follow me
And say unto those who have received the Scripture and those who read not Have ye too surrendered
If they surrender then truly they are rightly guided and if they turn away then it is thy duty only to convey the message unto them
Allah is Seer of His bondmen
Lo those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah and slay the prophets wrongfully and slay those of mankind who enjoin equity promise them a painful doom
Those are they whose works have failed in the world and the Hereafter and they have no helpers
Hast thou not seen how those who have received a portion of the Scripture invoke the Scripture of Allah in their disputes that it may judge between them then a faction of them turn away being opposed to it
That is because they say The Fire will not touch us save for a certain number of days
That which they used to invent hath deceived them regarding their religion
How will it be with them when We have brought them all together to a Day of which there is no doubt when every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned and they will not be wronged
Say O Allah Owner of Sovereignty
Thou givest sovereignty unto whom Thou wilt and Thou withdrawest sovereignty from whom Thou wilt Thou exaltest whom Thou wilt and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt
In Thy hand is the good Lo
Thou art Able to do all things
Thou causest the night to pass into the day and Thou causest the day to pass into the night And Thou bringest forth the living from the dead and Thou bringest forth the dead from the living
And Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou choosest without stint
Let not the believers take disbelievers for their friends in preference to believers
Whoso doeth that hath no connection with Allah unless it be that ye but guard yourselves against them taking as it were security
Allah biddeth you beware only of Himself
Unto Allah is the journeying
Say O Muhammad Whether ye hide that which is in your breasts or reveal it Allah knoweth it
He knoweth that which is in the heavens and that which is in the earth and Allah is Able to do all things
On the Day when every soul will find itself confronted with all that it hath done of good and all that it hath done of evil every soul will long that there might be a mighty space of distance between it and that evil
Allah biddeth you beware of Him
And Allah is Full of Pity for His bondmen
Say O Muhammad to mankind If ye love Allah follow me Allah will love you and forgive you your sins
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Say Obey Allah and the messenger But if they turn away lo
Allah loveth not the disbelievers in His guidance
Lo Allah preferred Adam and Noah and the Family of Abraham and the Family of Imran above all His creatures
They were descendants one of another
Allah is Hearer Knower
Remember when the wife of Imran said My Lord
I have vowed unto Thee that which is in my belly as a consecrated offering
Accept it from me
Lo Thou only Thou art the Hearer the Knower
And when she was delivered she said My Lord
Lo I am delivered of a female Allah knew best of what she was delivered the male is not as the female and lo
I have named her Mary and lo I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from Satan the outcast
And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth and made Zachariah her guardian
Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was he found that she had food
He said O Mary
Whence cometh unto thee this food
She answered It is from Allah
Allah giveth without stint to whom He will
Then Zachariah prayed unto his Lord and said My Lord
Bestow upon me of Thy bounty goodly offspring
Lo Thou art the Hearer of Prayer
And the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a son whose name is John who cometh to confirm a word from Allah lordly chaste a prophet of the righteous
He said My Lord
How can I have a son when age hath overtaken me already and my wife is barren
The angel answered So it will be Allah doeth what He will
He said My Lord
Appoint a token for me
The angel said The token unto thee shall be that thou shalt not speak unto mankind three days except by signs
Remember thy Lord much and praise Him in the early hours of night and morning
And when the angels said O Mary Lo
Allah hath chosen thee and made thee pure and hath preferred thee above all the women of creation
O Mary
Be obedient to thy Lord prostrate thyself and bow with those who bow in worship
This is of the tidings of things hidden
We reveal it unto thee Muhammad Thou wast not present with them when they threw their pens to know which of them should be the guardian of Mary nor wast thou present with them when they quarrelled thereupon
And remember when the angels said O Mary
Lo Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a word from him whose name is the Messiah Jesus son of Mary illustrious in the world and the Hereafter and one of those brought near unto Allah
He will speak unto mankind in his cradle and in his manhood and he is of the righteous
She said My Lord
How can I have a child when no mortal hath touched me
He said So it will be Allah createth what He will
If He decreeth a thing He saith unto it only Be and it is
And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel
And will make him a messenger unto the Children of Israel saying Lo
I come unto you with a sign from your Lord Lo
I fashion for you out of clay the likeness of a bird and I breathe into it and it is a bird by Allah s leave
I heal him who was born blind and the leper and I raise the dead by Allah s leave
And I announce unto you what ye eat and what ye store up in your houses
Lo herein verily is a portent for you if ye are to be believers
And I come confirming that which was before me of the Torah and to make lawful some of that which was forbidden unto you
I come unto you with a sign from your Lord so keep your duty to Allah and obey me
Lo Allah is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him
That is a straight path
But when Jesus became conscious of their disbelief he cried Who will be my helpers in the cause of Allah
The disciples said We will be Allah s helpers
We believe in Allah and bear thou witness that we have surrendered unto Him
Our Lord
We believe in that which Thou hast revealed and we follow him whom Thou hast sent
Enrol us among those who witness to the truth
And they the disbelievers schemed and Allah schemed against them and Allah is the best of schemers
And remember when Allah said O Jesus
Lo I am gathering thee and causing thee to ascend unto Me and am cleansing thee of those who disbelieve and am setting those who follow thee above those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection
Then unto Me ye will all return and I shall judge between you as to that wherein ye used to differ
As for those who disbelieve I shall chastise them with a heavy chastisement in the world and the Hereafter and they will have no helpers
And as for those who believe and do good works He will pay them their wages in full
Allah loveth not wrongdoers
This which We recite unto thee is a revelation and a wise reminder
Lo the likeness of Jesus with Allah is as the likeness of Adam
He created him of dust then He said unto him Be and he is
This is the truth from thy Lord O Muhammad so be not thou of those who waver
And whoso disputeth with thee concerning him after the knowledge which hath come unto thee say unto him Come We will summon our sons and your sons and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves then we will pray humbly to our Lord and solemnly invoke the curse of Allah upon those who lie
Lo This verily is the true narrative
There is no Allah save Allah and lo
Allah He verily is is the Mighty the Wise
And if they turn away then lo Allah is Aware of who are the corrupters
Say O People of the Scripture
Come to an agreement between us and you that we shall worship none but Allah and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah
And if they turn away then say Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered unto Him
O People of the Scripture
Why will ye argue about Abraham when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed till after him Have ye then no sense
Lo ye are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge
Allah knoweth Ye know not
Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian but he was an upright man who had surrendered to Allah and he was not of the idolaters
Lo those of mankind who have the best claim to Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe with him and Allah is the Protecting Guardian of the believers
A party of the People of the Scripture long to make you go astray and they make none to go astray except themselves but they perceive not
O People of the Scripture
Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of Allah when ye yourselves bear witness to their truth
O People of the Scripture
Why confound ye truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth
And a party of the People of the Scripture say Believe in that which hath been revealed unto those who believe at the opening of the day and disbelieve at the end thereof in order that they may return
And believe not save in one who followeth your religion Say O Muhammad Lo the guidance is Allah s Guidance that anyone is given the like of that which was given unto you or that they may argue with you in the presence of their Lord
Say O Muhammad Lo the bounty is in Allah s hand
He bestoweth it on whom He will
Allah is AllEmbracing AllKnowing
He selecteth for His mercy whom He will
Allah is of Infinite Bounty
Among the People of the Scripture there is he who if thou trust him with a weight of treasure will return it to thee
And among them there is he who if thou trust him with a piece of gold will not return it to thee unless thou keep standing over him
That is because they say We have no duty to the Gentiles They speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly
Nay but the chosen of Allah is he who fulfilleth his pledge and wardeth off evil for lo Allah loveth those who ward off evil
Lo those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah s covenant and their oaths they have no portion in the Hereafter
Allah will neither speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He make them grow
Theirs will be a painful doom
And lo there is a party of them who distort the Scripture with their tongues that ye may think that what they say is from the Scripture when it is not from the Scripture And they say It is from Allah when it is not from Allah and they speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly
It is not possible for any human being unto whom Allah had given the Scripture and wisdom and the prophethood that he should afterwards have said unto mankind Be slaves of me instead of Allah but what he said was Be ye faithful servants of the Lord by virtue of your constant teaching of the Scripture and of your constant study thereof
And he commanded you not that ye should take the angels and the prophets for lords
Would he command you to disbelieve after ye had surrendered to Allah
When Allah made His covenant with the prophets He said Behold that which I have given you of the Scripture and knowledge And afterward there will come unto you a messenger confirming that which ye possess
Ye shall believe in him and ye shall help him
He said Do ye agree and will ye take up My burden which I lay upon you in this matter They answered We agree
Then whosoever after this shall turn away they will be miscreants
Seek they other than the religion of Allah when unto Him submitteth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and unto Him they will be returned
Say O Muhammad We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes and that which was vouchsafed unto Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord
We make no distinction between any of them and unto Him we have surrendered
And whoso seeketh as religion other than the Surrender to Allah it will not be accepted from him and he will be a loser in the Hereafter
How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and after they bore witness that the messenger is true and after clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty had come unto them
And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
As for such their guerdon is that on them rests the curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined
They will abide therein
Their doom will not be lightened neither will they be reprieved
Save those who afterward repent and do right
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Lo those who disbelieve after their profession of belief and afterward grow violent in disbelief their repentance will not be accepted
And such are those who are astray
Lo those who disbelieve and die in disbelief the whole earth full of gold would not be accepted from such an one if it were offered as a ransom for his soul
Theirs will be a painful doom and they will have no helpers
Ye will not attain unto piety until ye spend of that which ye love
And whatsoever ye spend Allah is Aware thereof
All food was lawful unto the Children of Israel save that which Israel forbade himself in days before the Torah was revealed
Say Produce the Torah and read it unto us if ye are truthful
And whoever shall invent a falsehood after that concerning Allah such will be wrongdoers
Say Allah speaketh truth
So follow the religion of Abraham the upright
He was not of the idolaters
Lo the first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at Becca a blessed place a guidance to the peoples
Wherein are plain memorials of Allah s guidance the place where Abraham stood up to pray and whosoever entereth it is safe
And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah for mankind for him who can find a way thither
As for him who disbelieveth let him know that lo Allah is Independent of all creatures
Say O People of the Scripture
Why disbelieve ye in the revelations of Allah when Allah Himself is Witness of what ye do
Say O People of the Scripture
Why drive ye back believers from the way of Allah seeking to make it crooked when ye are witnesses to Allah s guidance
Allah is not unaware of what ye do
O ye who believe
If ye obey a party of those who have received the Scripture they will make you disbelievers after your belief
How can ye disbelieve when it is ye unto whom Allah s revelations are recited and His messenger is in your midst
He who holdeth fast to Allah he indeed is guided unto a right path
O ye who believe
Observe your duty to Allah with right observance and die not save as those who have surrendered unto Him
And hold fast all of you together to the cable of Allah and do not separate
And remember Allah s favour unto you How ye were enemies and He made friendship between your hearts so that ye became as brothers by His grace and how ye were upon the brink of an abyss of fire and He did save you from it
Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations unto you that haply ye may be guided
And there may spring from you a nation who invite to goodness and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency
Such are they who are successful
And be ye not as those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs had come unto them
For such there is an awful doom
On the Day when some faces will be whitened and some faces will be blackened and as for those whose faces have been blackened it will be said unto them Disbelieved ye after your profession of belief
Then taste the punishment for that ye disbelieved
And as for those whose faces have been whitened in the mercy of Allah they dwell for ever
These are revelations of Allah
We recite them unto thee in truth
Allah willeth no injustice to His creatures
Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and unto Allah all things are returned
Ye are the best community that hath been raised up for mankind
Ye enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency and ye believe in Allah
And if the People of the Scripture had believed it had been better for them
Some of them are believers but most of them are evillivers
They will not harm you save a trifling hurt and if they fight against you they will turn and flee
And afterward they will not be helped
Ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save where they grasp a rope from Allah and a rope from men
They have incurred anger from their Lord and wretchedness is laid upon them
That is because they used to disbelieve the revelations of Allah and slew the prophets wrongfully
That is because they were rebellious and used to transgress
They are not all alike
Of the People of the Scripture there is a staunch community who recite the revelations of Allah in the night season falling prostrate before Him
They believe in Allah and the Last Day and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency and vie one with another in good works
These are of the righteous
And whatever good they do they will not be denied the meed thereof
Allah is Aware of those who ward off evil
Lo the riches and the progeny of those who disbelieve will not avail them aught against Allah and such are rightful owners of the Fire
They will abide therein
The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world is as the likeness of a biting icy wind which smiteth the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and devastateth it
Allah wronged them not but they do wrong themselves
O ye who believe
Take not for intimates others than your own folk who would spare no pains to ruin you they love to hamper you
Hatred is revealed by the utterance of their mouths but that which their breasts hide is greater
We have made plain for you the revelations if ye will understand
Lo ye are those who love them though they love you not and ye believe in all the Scripture
When they fall in with you they say We believe but when they go apart they bite their fingertips at you for rage
Say Perish in your rage
Lo Allah is Aware of what is hidden in your breasts
If a lucky chance befall you it is evil unto them and if disaster strike you they rejoice thereat
But if ye persevere and keep from evil their guile will never harm you
Lo Allah is Surrounding what they do
And when thou settedst forth at daybreak from thy housefolk to assign to the believers their positions for the battle Allah was Hearer Knower
When two parties of you almost fell away and Allah was their Protecting Friend
In Allah let believers put their trust
Allah had already given you the victory at Badr when ye were contemptible
So observe your duty to Allah in order that ye may be thankful
When thou didst say unto the believers Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should support you with three thousand angels sent down to your help
Nay but if ye persevere and keep from evil and the enemy attack you suddenly your Lord will help you with five thousand angels sweeping on
Allah ordained this only as a message of good cheer for you and that thereby your hearts might be at rest Victory cometh only from Allah the Mighty the Wise
That He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve or overwhelm them so that they retire frustrated
It is no concern at all of thee Muhammad whether He relent toward them or punish them for they are evildoers
Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
He forgiveth whom He will and punisheth whom He will
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O ye who believe
Devour not usury doubling and quadrupling the sum lent
Observe your duty to Allah that ye may be successful
And ward off from yourselves the Fire prepared for disbelievers
And obey Allah and the messenger that ye may find mercy
And vie one with another for forgiveness from your Lord and for a paradise as wide as are the heavens and the earth prepared for those who ward off evil
Those who spend of that which Allah hath given them in ease and in adversity those who control their wrath and are forgiving toward mankind Allah loveth the good
And those who when they do an evil thing or wrong themselves remember Allah and implore forgiveness for their sins Who forgiveth sins save Allah only and will not knowingly repeat the wrong they did
The reward of such will be forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever a bountiful reward for workers
Systems have passed away before you
Do but travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for those who did deny the messengers
This is a declaration for mankind a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off evil
Faint not nor grieve for ye will overcome them if ye are indeed believers
If ye have received a blow the disbelieving people have received a blow the like thereof
These are only the vicissitudes which We cause to follow one another for mankind to the end that Allah may know those who believe and may choose witnesses from among you and Allah loveth not wrongdoers
And that Allah may prove those who believe and may blight the disbelievers
Or deemed ye that ye would enter paradise while yet Allah knoweth not those of you who really strive nor knoweth those of you who are steadfast
And verily ye used to wish for death before ye met it in the field
Now ye have seen it with your eyes
Muhammad is but a messenger messengers the like of whom have passed away before him
Will it be that when he dieth or is slain ye will turn back on your heels
He who turneth back on his heels doth no hurt to Allah and Allah will reward the thankful
No soul can ever die except by Allah s leave and at a term appointed
Whoso desireth the reward of the world We bestow on him thereof and whoso desireth the reward of the Hereafter We bestow on him thereof
We shall reward the thankful
And with how many a prophet have there been a number of devoted men who fought beside him
They quailed not for aught that befell them in the way of Allah nor did they weaken nor were they brought low
Allah loveth the steadfast
Their cry was only that they said Our Lord forgive us for our sins and wasted efforts make our foothold sure and give us victory over the disbelieving folk
So Allah gave them the reward of the world and the good reward of the Hereafter
Allah loveth those whose deeds are good
O ye who believe if ye obey those who disbelieve they will make you turn back on your heels and ye turn back as losers
But Allah is your Protector and He is the Best of Helpers
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they ascribe unto Allah partners for which no warrant hath been revealed
Their habitation is the Fire and hapless the abode of the wrongdoers
Allah verily made good His promise unto you when ye routed them by His leave until the moment when your courage failed you and ye disagreed about the order and ye disobeyed after He had shown you that for which ye long
Some of you desired the world and some of you desired the Hereafter
Therefore He made you flee from them that He might try you
Yet now He hath forgiven you
Allah is a Lord of Kindness to believers
When ye climbed the hill and paid no heed to anyone while the messenger in your rear was calling you to fight
Therefor He rewarded you grief for his grief that He might teach you not to sorrow either for that which ye missed or for that which befell you
Allah is Informed of what ye do
Then after grief He sent down security for you
As slumber did it overcome a party of you while the other party who were anxious on their own account thought wrongly of Allah the thought of ignorance They said Have we any part in the cause
Say O Muhammad The cause belongeth wholly to Allah
They hide within themselves a thought which they reveal not unto thee saying Had we had any part in the cause we should not have been slain here
Say Even though ye had been in your houses those appointed to be slain would have gone forth to the places where they were to lie
All this hath been in order that Allah might try what is in your breasts and prove what is in your hearts
Allah is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts of men
Lo those of you who turned back on the day when the two hosts met Satan alone it was who caused them to backslide because of some of that which they have earned
Now Allah hath forgiven them
Lo Allah is Forgiving Clement
O ye who believe
Be not as those who disbelieved and said of their brethren who went abroad in the land or were fighting in the field If they had been here with us they would not have died or been killed that Allah may make it anguish in their hearts
Allah giveth life and causeth death and Allah is Seer of what ye do
And what though ye be slain in Allah s way or die therein Surely pardon from Allah and mercy are better than all that they amass
What though ye be slain or die when unto Allah ye are gathered
It was by the mercy of Allah that thou wast lenient with them O Muhammad for if thou hadst been stern and fierce of heart they would have dispersed from round about thee
So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult with them upon the conduct of affairs
And when thou art resolved then put thy trust in Allah
Lo Allah loveth those who put their trust in Him
If Allah is your helper none can overcome you and if He withdraw His help from you who is there who can help you after Him
In Allah let believers put their trust
It is not for any prophet to embezzle
Whoso embezzleth will bring what he embezzled with him on the Day of Resurrection
Then every soul will be paid in full what it hath earned and they will not be wronged
Is one who followeth the pleasure of Allah as one who hath earned condemnation from Allah whose habitation is the Fire a hapless journey s end
There are degrees of grace and reprobation with Allah and Allah is Seer of what they do
Allah verily hath shown grace to the believers by sending unto them a messenger of their own who reciteth unto them His revelations and causeth them to grow and teacheth them the Scripture and wisdom although before he came to them they were in flagrant error
And was it so when a disaster smote you though ye had smitten them with a disaster twice as great that ye said How is this
Say unto them O Muhammad It is from yourselves
Lo Allah is Able to do all things
That which befell you on the day when the two armies met was by permission of Allah that He might know the true believers
And that He might know the hypocrites unto whom it was said Come fight in the way of Allah or defend yourselves
They answered If we knew aught of fighting we would follow you
On that day they were nearer disbelief than faith
They utter with their mouths a thing which is not in their hearts
Allah is Best Aware of what they hide
Those who while they sat at home said of their brethren who were fighting for the cause of Allah If they had been guided by us they would not have been slain Say unto them O Muhammad Then avert death from yourselves if ye are truthful
Think not of those who are slain in the way of Allah as dead
Nay they are living With their Lord they have provision
Jubilant are they because of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind That there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
They rejoice because of favour from Allah and kindness and that Allah wasteth not the wage of the believers
As for those who heard the call of Allah and His messenger after the harm befell them in the fight for such of them as do right and ward off evil there is great reward
Those unto whom men said Lo the people have gathered against you therefor fear them
The threat of danger but increased the faith of them and they cried Allah is Sufficient for us
Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust
So they returned with grace and favour from Allah and no harm touched them They followed the good pleasure of Allah and Allah is of Infinite Bounty
It is only the devil who would make men fear his partisans
Fear them not fear Me if ye are true believers
Let not their conduct grieve thee who run easily to disbelief for lo they injure Allah not at all
It is Allah s Will to assign them no portion in the Hereafter and theirs will be an awful doom
Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith harm Allah not at all but theirs will be a painful doom
And let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein We give them bodeth good unto their souls
We only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness
And theirs will be a shameful doom
It is not the purpose of Allah to leave you in your present state till He shall separate the wicked from the good
And it is not the purpose of Allah to let you know the Unseen
But Allah chooseth of His messengers whom He will to receive knowledge thereof
So believe in Allah and His messengers
If ye believe and ward off evil yours will be a vast reward
And let not those who hoard up that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty think that it is better for them
Nay it is worse for them
That which they hoard will be their collar on the Day of Resurrection
Allah s is the heritage of the heavens and the earth and Allah is Informed of what ye do
Verily Allah heard the saying of those who said when asked for contributions to the war Allah forsooth is poor and we are rich
We shall record their saying with their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and We shall say Taste ye the punishment of burning
This is on account of that which your own hands have sent before you to the judgment
Allah is no oppressor of His bondmen
The same are those who say Lo Allah hath charged us that we believe not in any messenger until he bring us an offering which fire from heaven shall devour
Say unto them O Muhammad Messengers came unto you before me with miracles and with that very miracle which ye describe
Why then did ye slay them Answer that if ye are truthful
And if they deny thee even so did they deny messengers who were before thee who came with miracles and with the Psalms and with the Scripture giving light
Every soul will taste of death
And ye will be paid on the Day of Resurrection only that which ye have fairly earned
Whoso is removed from the Fire and is made to enter paradise he indeed is triumphant
The life of this world is but comfort of illusion
Assuredly ye will be tried in your property and in your persons and ye will hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you and from the idolaters
But if ye persevere and ward off evil then that is of the steadfast heart of things
And remember when Allah laid a charge on those who had received the Scripture He said Ye are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it
But they flung it behind their backs and bought thereby a little gain
Verily evil is that which they have gained thereby
Think not that those who exult in what they have given and love to be praised for what they have not done Think not they are in safety from the doom
A painful doom is theirs
Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
Allah is Able to do all things
Lo In the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the difference of night and day are tokens of His Sovereignty for men of understanding
Such as remember Allah standing sitting and reclining and consider the creation of the heavens and the earth and say Our Lord
Thou createdst not this in vain
Glory be to Thee
Preserve us from the doom of Fire
Our Lord
Whom Thou causest to enter the Fire him indeed Thou hast confounded
For evildoers there will be no helpers
Our Lord
Lo we have heard a crier calling unto Faith Believe ye in your Lord So we believed
Our Lord
Therefor forgive us our sins and remit from us our evil deeds and make us die the death of the righteous
Our Lord
And give us that which Thou hast promised to us by Thy messengers Confound us not upon the Day of Resurrection
Lo Thou breakest not the tryst
And their Lord hath heard them and He saith Lo I suffer not the work of any worker male or female to be lost
Ye proceed one from another
So those who fled and were driven forth from their homes and suffered damage for My cause and fought and were slain verily I shall remit their evil deeds from them and verily I shall bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow A reward from Allah
And with Allah is the fairest of rewards
Let not the vicissitude of the success of those who disbelieve in the land deceive thee O Muhammad
It is but a brief comfort
And afterward their habitation will be hell an ill abode
But those who keep their duty to their Lord for them are Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will be safe for ever
A gift of welcome from their Lord
That which Allah hath in store is better for the righteous
And lo of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto you and that which was revealed unto them humbling themselves before Allah They purchase not a trifling gain at the price of the revelations of Allah
Verily their reward is with their Lord
Lo Allah is swift to take account
O ye who believe
Endure outdo all others in endurance be ready and observe your duty to Allah in order that ye may succeed
O mankind
Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you from a single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath spread abroad a multitude of men and women
Be careful of your duty toward Allah in Whom ye claim your rights of one another and toward the wombs that bare you Lo
Allah hath been a watcher over you
Give unto orphans their wealth Exchange not the good for the bad in your management thereof nor absorb their wealth into your own wealth
Lo that would be a great sin
And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans marry of the women who seem good to you two or three or four and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice to so many then one only or the captives that your right hands possess
Thus it is more likely that ye will not do injustice
And give unto the women whom ye marry free gift of their marriage portions but if they of their own accord remit unto you a part thereof then ye are welcome to absorb it in your wealth
Give not unto the foolish what is in your keeping of their wealth which Allah hath given you to maintain but feed and clothe them from it and speak kindly unto them
Prove orphans till they reach the marriageable age then if ye find them of sound judgment deliver over unto them their fortune and devour it not by squandering and in haste lest they should grow up Whoso of the guardians is rich let him abstain generously from taking of the property of orphans and whoso is poor let him take thereof in reason for his guardianship
And when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans have the transaction witnessed in their presence
Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner
Unto the men of a family belongeth a share of that which parents and near kindred leave and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave whether it be little or much a legal share
And when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are present at the division of the heritage bestow on them therefrom and speak kindly unto them
And let those fear in their behaviour toward orphans who if they left behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them
So let them mind their duty to Allah and speak justly
Lo Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully they do but swallow fire into their bellies and they will be exposed to burning flame
Allah chargeth you concerning the provision for your children to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females and if there be women more than two then theirs is twothirds of the inheritance and if there be one only then the half
And to each of his parents a sixth of the inheritance if he have a son and if he have no son and his parents are his heirs then to his mother appertaineth the third and if he have brethren then to his mother appertaineth the sixth after any legacy he may have bequeathed or debt hath been paid
Your parents and your children Ye know not which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness
It is an injunction from Allah
Lo
Allah is Knower Wise
And unto you belongeth a half of that which your wives leave if they have no child but if they have a child then unto you the fourth of that which they leave after any legacy they may have bequeathed or debt they may have contracted hath been paid
And unto them belongeth the fourth of that which ye leave if ye have no child but if ye have a child then the eighth of that which ye leave after any legacy ye may have bequeathed or debt ye may have contracted hath been paid
And if a man or a woman have a distant heir having left neither parent nor child and he or she have a brother or a sister only on the mother s side then to each of them twain the brother and the sister the sixth and if they be more than two then they shall be sharers in the third after any legacy that may have been bequeathed or debt contracted not injuring the heirs by willing away more than a third of the heritage hath been paid
A commandment from Allah
Allah is Knower Indulgent
These are the limits imposed by Allah
Whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow where such will dwell for ever
That will be the great success
And whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger and transgresseth His limits He will make him enter Fire where he will dwell for ever his will be a shameful doom
As for those of your women who are guilty of lewdness call to witness four of you against them
And if they testify to the truth of the allegation then confine them to the houses until death take them or until Allah appoint for them a way through new legislation
And as for the two of you who are guilty thereof punish them both
And if they repent and improve then let them be
Lo Allah is ever relenting Merciful
Forgiveness is only incumbent on Allah toward those who do evil in ignorance and then turn quickly in repentance to Allah
These are they toward whom Allah relenteth
Allah is ever Knower Wise
The forgiveness is not for those who do illdeeds until when death attendeth upon one of them he saith Lo I repent now nor yet for those who die while they are disbelievers
For such We have prepared a painful doom
O ye who believe
It is not lawful for you forcibly to inherit the women of your deceased kinsmen nor that ye should put constraint upon them that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness
But consort with them in kindness for if ye hate them it may happen that ye hate a thing wherein Allah hath placed much good
And if ye wish to exchange one wife for another and ye have given unto one of them a sum of money however great take nothing from it
Would ye take it by the way of calumny and open wrong
How can ye take it back after one of you hath gone in unto the other and they have taken a strong pledge from you
And marry not those women whom your fathers married except what hath already happened of that nature in the past
Lo it was ever lewdness and abomination and an evil way
Forbidden unto you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your father s sisters and your mother s sisters and your brother s daughters and your sister s daughters and your fostermothers and your fostersisters and your mothersinlaw and your stepdaughters who are under your protection born of your women unto whom ye have gone in but if ye have not gone in unto them then it is no sin for you to marry their daughters and the wives of your sons who spring from your own loins And it is forbidden unto you that ye should have two sisters together except what hath already happened of that nature in the past
Lo Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hands possess
It is a decree of Allah for you
Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock not debauchery
And those of whom ye seek content by marrying them give unto them their portions as a duty
And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty hath been done
Lo Allah is ever Knower Wise
And whoso is not able to afford to marry free believing women let them marry from the believing maids whom your right hands possess
Allah knoweth best concerning your faith
Ye proceed one from another so wed them by permission of their folk and give unto them their portions in kindness they being honest not debauched nor of loose conduct
And if when they are honourably married they commit lewdness they shall incur the half of the punishment prescribed for free women in that case
This is for him among you who feareth to commit sin
But to have patience would be better for you
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Allah would explain to you and guide you by the examples of those who were before you and would turn to you in mercy
Allah is Knower Wise
And Allah would turn to you in mercy but those who follow vain desires would have you go tremendously astray
Allah would make the burden light for you for man was created weak
O ye who believe
Squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity except it be a trade by mutual consent and kill not one another
Lo Allah is ever Merciful unto you
Whoso doeth that through aggression and injustice we shall cast him into Fire and that is ever easy for Allah
If ye avoid the great things which ye are forbidden We will remit from you your evil deeds and make you enter at a noble gate
And covet not the thing in which Allah hath made some of you excel others
Unto men a fortune from that which they have earned and unto women a fortune from that which they have earned
Envy not one another but ask Allah of His bounty
Lo Allah is ever Knower of all things
And unto each We have appointed heirs of that which parents and near kindred leave and as for those with whom your right hands have made a covenant give them their due Lo
Allah is ever Witness over all things
Men are in charge of women because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other and because they spend of their property for the support of women
So good women are the obedient guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded
As for those from whom ye fear rebellion admonish them and banish them to beds apart and scourge them
Then if they obey you seek not a way against them Lo
Allah is ever High Exalted Great
And if ye fear a breach between them twain the man and wife appoint an arbiter from his folk and an arbiter from her folk
If they desire amendment Allah will make them of one mind
Lo Allah is ever Knower Aware
And serve Allah Ascribe no thing as partner unto Him
Show kindness unto parents and unto near kindred and orphans and the needy and unto the neighbour who is of kin unto you and the neighbour who is not of kin and the fellowtraveller and the wayfarer and the slaves whom your right hands possess
Lo Allah loveth not such as are proud and boastful
Who hoard their wealth and enjoin avarice on others and hide that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty
For disbelievers We prepare a shameful doom
And also those who spend their wealth in order to be seen of men and believe not in Allah nor the Last Day
Whoso taketh Satan for a comrade a bad comrade hath he
What have they to fear if they believe in Allah and the Last Day and spend aright of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them when Allah is ever Aware of them and all they do
Lo Allah wrongeth not even of the weight of an ant and if there is a good deed He will double it and will give the doer from His presence an immense reward
But how will it be with them when We bring of every people a witness and We bring thee O Muhammad a witness against these
On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger will wish that they were level with the ground and they can hide no fact from Allah
O ye who believe
Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken till ye know that which ye utter nor when ye are polluted save when journeying upon the road till ye have bathed
And if ye be ill or on a journey or one of you cometh from the closet or ye have touched women and ye find not water then go to high clean soil and rub your faces and your hands therewith
Lo Allah is Benign Forgiving
Seest thou not those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given how they purchase error and seek to make you Muslims err from the right way
Allah knoweth best who are your enemies
Allah is sufficient as a Guardian and Allah is sufficient as a Supporter
Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say We hear and disobey hear thou as one who heareth not and Listen to us distorting with their tongues and slandering religion
If they had said We hear and we obey hear thou and look at us it had been better for them and more upright
But Allah hath cursed them for their disbelief so they believe not save a few
O ye unto whom the Scripture hath been given
Believe in what We have revealed confirming that which ye possess before We destroy countenances so as to confound them or curse them as We cursed the Sabbathbreakers of old time
The commandment of Allah is always executed
Allah forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him He forgiveth all save that to whom He will
Whoso ascribeth partners to Allah he hath indeed invented a tremendous sin
Hast thou not seen those who praise themselves for purity
Nay Allah purifieth whom He will and they will not be wronged even the hair upon a datestone
See how they invent lies about Allah
That of itself is flagrant sin
Hast thou not seen those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given how they believe in idols and false deities and how they say of those idolaters who disbelieve These are more rightly guided than those who believe
Those are they whom Allah hath cursed and he whom Allah hath cursed thou O Muhammad wilt find for him no helper
Or have they even a share in the Sovereignty
Then in that case they would not give mankind even the speck on a datestone
Or are they jealous of mankind because of that which Allah of His bounty hath bestowed upon them
For We bestowed upon the house of Abraham of old the Scripture and wisdom and We bestowed on them a mighty kingdom
And of them were some who believed therein and of them were some who turned away from it
Hell is sufficient for their burning
Lo Those who disbelieve Our revelations We shall expose them to the Fire
As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment
Lo Allah is ever Mighty Wise
And as for those who believe and do good works We shall make them enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow to dwell therein for ever there for them are pure companions and We shall make them enter plenteous shade
Lo Allah commandeth you that ye restore deposits to their owners and if ye judge between mankind that ye judge justly
Lo comely is this which Allah admonisheth you
Lo Allah is ever Hearer Seer
O ye who believe
Obey Allah and obey the messenger and those of you who are in authority and if ye have a dispute concerning any matter refer it to Allah and the messenger if ye are in truth believers in Allah and the Last Day
That is better and more seemly in the end
Hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee how they would go for judgment in their disputes to false deities when they have been ordered to abjure them
Satan would mislead them far astray
And when it is said unto them Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the messenger thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion
How would it be if a misfortune smote them because of that which their own hands have sent before them Then would they come unto thee swearing by Allah that they were seeking naught but harmony and kindness
Those are they the secrets of whose hearts Allah knoweth
So oppose them and admonish them and address them in plain terms about their souls
We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah s leave
And if when they had wronged themselves they had but come unto thee and asked forgiveness of Allah and asked forgiveness of the messenger they would have found Allah Forgiving Merciful
But nay by thy Lord they will not believe in truth until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou decidest and submit with full submission
And if We had decreed for them Lay down your lives or go forth from your dwellings but few of them would have done it though if they did what they are exhorted to do it would be better for them and more strengthening
And then We should bestow upon them from Our presence an immense reward
And should guide them unto a straight path
Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger they are with those unto whom Allah hath shown favour of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous
The best of company are they
That is bounty from Allah and Allah sufficeth as Knower
O ye who believe
Take your precautions then advance the proven ones or advance all together
Lo among you there is he who loitereth and if disaster overtook you he would say Allah hath been gracious unto me since I was not present with them
And if a bounty from Allah befell you he would surely cry as if there had been no love between you and him Oh would that I had been with them then should I have achieved a great success
Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other
Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah be he slain or be he victorious on him We shall bestow a vast reward
How should ye not fight for the cause of Allah and of the feeble among men and of the women and the children who are crying Our Lord
Bring us forth from out this town of which the people are oppressors Oh give us from thy presence some protecting friend
Those who believe do battle for the cause of Allah and those who disbelieve do battle for the cause of idols
So fight the minions of the devil
Lo the devil s strategy is ever weak
Hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said Withhold your hands establish worship and pay the poordue but when fighting was prescribed for them behold a party of them fear mankind even as their fear of Allah or with greater fear and say Our Lord
Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us
If only Thou wouldst give us respite yet a while
Say unto them O Muhammad The comfort of this world is scant the Hereafter will be better for him who wardeth off evil and ye will not be wronged the down upon a datestone
Wheresoever ye may be death will overtake you even though ye were in lofty towers
Yet if a happy thing befalleth them they say This is from Allah and if an evil thing befalleth them they say This is of thy doing O Muhammad
Say unto them All is from Allah
What is amiss with these people that they come not nigh to understand a happening
Whatever of good befalleth thee O man it is from Allah and whatever of ill befalleth thee it is from thyself
We have sent thee Muhammad as a messenger unto mankind and Allah is sufficient as Witness
Whoso obeyeth the messenger hath obeyed Allah and whoso turneth away We have not sent thee as a warder over them
And they say It is obedience but when they have gone forth from thee a party of them spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest
Allah recordeth what they plan by night
So oppose them and put thy trust in Allah
Allah is sufficient as Trustee
Will they not then ponder on the Qur an
If it had been from other than Allah they would have found therein much incongruity
And if any tidings whether of safety or fear come unto them they noise it abroad whereas if they had referred it to the messenger and to such of them as are in authority those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known it
If it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy ye would have followed Satan save a few of you
So fight O Muhammad in the way of Allah Thou art not taxed with the responsibility for anyone except thyself and urge on the believers
Peradventure Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve
Allah is stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment
Whoso interveneth in a good cause will have the reward thereof and whoso interveneth in an evil cause will bear the consequence thereof
Allah overseeth all things
When ye are greeted with a greeting greet ye with a better than it or return it
Lo Allah taketh count of all things
There is no Allah save Him He gathereth you all unto a Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt
Who is more true in statement than Allah
What aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites when Allah cast them back to disbelief because of what they earned
Seek ye to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray
He whom Allah sendeth astray for him thou O MUhammad canst not find a road
They long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve that ye may be upon a level with them
So choose not friends from them till they forsake their homes in the way of Allah if they turn back to enmity then take them and kill them wherever ye find them and choose no friend nor helper from among them
Except those who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant or those who come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make war on you or make war on their own folk
Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you
So if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace Allah alloweth you no way against them
Ye will find others who desire that they should have security from you and security from their own folk
So often as they are returned to hostility they are plunged therein
If they keep not aloof from you nor offer you peace nor hold their hands then take them and kill them wherever ye find them
Against such We have given you clear warrant
It is not for a believer to kill a believer unless it be by mistake
He who hath killed a believer by mistake must set free a believing slave and pay the bloodmoney to the family of the slain unless they remit it as a charity
If he the victim be of a people hostile unto you and he is a believer then the penance is to set free a believing slave
And if he cometh of a folk between whom and you there is a covenant then the bloodmoney must be paid unto his folk and also a believing slave must be set free
And whoso hath not the wherewithal must fast two consecutive months A penance from Allah
Allah is Knower Wise
Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose his reward is hell for ever
Allah is wroth against him and He hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom
O ye who believe
When ye go forth to fight in the way of Allah be careful to discriminate and say not unto one who offereth you peace Thou art not a believer seeking the chance profits of this life so that ye may despoil him
With Allah are plenteous spoils
Even thus as he now is were ye before but Allah hath since then been gracious unto you
Therefore take care to discriminate
Allah is ever Informed of what ye do
Those of the believers who sit still other than those who have a disabling hurt are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and lives
Allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives a rank above the sedentary
Unto each Allah hath promised good but He hath bestowed on those who strive a great reward above the sedentary
Degrees of rank from Him and forgiveness and mercy
Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
Lo as for those whom the angels take in death while they wrong themselves the angels will ask In what were ye engaged
They will say We were oppressed in the land
The angels will say Was not Allah s earth spacious that ye could have migrated therein
As for such their habitation will be hell an evil journey s end
Except the feeble among men and the women and the children who are unable to devise a plan and are not shown a way
As for such it may be that Allah will pardon them
Allah is ever Clement Forgiving
Whoso migrateth for the cause of Allah will find much refuge and abundance in the earth and whoso forsaketh his home a fugitive unto Allah and His messenger and death overtaketh him his reward is then incumbent on Allah
Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
And when ye go forth in the land it is no sin for you to curtail your worship if ye fear that those who disbelieve may attack you
In truth the disbelievers are an open enemy to you
And when thou O Muhammad art among them and arrangest their worship for them let only a party of them stand with thee to worship and let them take their arms
Then when they have performed their prostrations let them fall to the rear and let another party come that hath not worshipped and let them worship with thee and let them take their precaution and their arms
Those who disbelieve long for you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they may attack you once for all
It is no sin for you to lay aside your arms if rain impedeth you or ye are sick But take your precaution
Lo Allah prepareth for the disbelievers shameful punishment
When ye have performed the act of worship remember Allah standing sitting and reclining
And when ye are in safety observe proper worship
Worship at fixed times hath been enjoined on the believers
Relent not in pursuit of the enemy
If ye are suffering lo they suffer even as ye suffer and ye hope from Allah that for which they cannot hope
Allah is ever Knower Wise
Lo We reveal unto thee the Scripture with the truth that thou mayst judge between mankind by that which Allah showeth thee
And be not thou a pleader for the treacherous
And seek forgiveness of Allah
Lo Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
And plead not on behalf of people who deceive themselves
Lo Allah loveth not one who is treacherous and sinful
They seek to hide from men and seek not to hide from Allah
He is with them when by night they hold discourse displeasing unto Him
Allah ever surroundeth what they do
Ho ye are they who pleaded for them in the life of the world
But who will plead with Allah for them on the Day of Resurrection or who will then be their defender
Yet whoso doeth evil or wrongeth his own soul then seeketh pardon of Allah will find Allah Forgiving Merciful
Whoso committeth sin committeth it only against himself
Allah is ever Knower Wise
And whoso committeth a delinquency or crime then throweth the blame thereof upon the innocent hath burdened himself with falsehood and a flagrant crime
But for the grace of Allah upon thee Muhammad and His mercy a party of them had resolved to mislead thee but they will mislead only themselves and they will hurt thee not at all
Allah revealeth unto thee the Scripture and wisdom and teacheth thee that which thou knewest not
The grace of Allah toward thee hath been infinite
There is no good in much of their secret conferences save in him who enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peacemaking among the people
Whoso doeth that seeking the good pleasure of Allah We shall bestow on him a vast reward
And whoso opposeth the messenger after the guidance of Allah hath been manifested unto him and followeth other than the believer s way We appoint for him that unto which he himself hath turned and expose him unto hell a hapless journey s end
Lo Allah pardoneth not that partners should be ascribed unto Him
He pardoneth all save that to whom He will
Whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah hath wandered far astray
They invoke in His stead only females they pray to none else than Satan a rebel
Whom Allah cursed and he said Surely I will take of Thy bondmen an appointed portion
And surely I will lead them astray and surely I will arouse desires in them and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle ears and surely I will command them and they will change Allah s creation
Whoso chooseth Satan for a patron instead of Allah is verily a loser and his loss is manifest
He promiseth them and stirreth up desires in them and Satan promiseth them only to beguile
For such their habitation will be hell and they will find no refuge therefrom
But as for those who believe and do good works We shall bring them into Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever
It is a promise from Allah in truth and who can be more truthful than Allah in utterance
It will not be in accordance with your desires nor the desires of the People of the Scripture
He who doeth wrong will have the recompense thereof and will not find against Allah any protecting friend or helper
And whoso doeth good works whether of male or female and he or she is a believer such will enter paradise and they will not be wronged the dint in a datestone
Who is better in religion than he who surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good to men and followeth the tradition of Abraham the upright
Allah Himself chose Abraham for friend
Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
Allah ever surroundeth all things
They consult thee concerning women
Say Allah giveth you decree concerning them and the Scripture which hath been recited unto you giveth decree concerning female orphans and those unto whom ye give not that which is ordained for them though ye desire to marry them and concerning the weak among children and that ye should deal justly with orphans
Whatever good ye do lo Allah is ever Aware of it
If a woman feareth ill treatment from her husband or desertion it is no sin for them twain if they make terms of peace between themselves
Peace is better
But greed hath been made present in the minds of men
If ye do good and keep from evil lo Allah is ever Informed of what ye do
Ye will not be able to deal equally between your wives however much ye wish to do so
But turn not altogether away from one leaving her as in suspense
If ye do good and keep from evil lo Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
But if they separate Allah will compensate each out of His abundance
Allah is ever AllEmbracing AllKnowing
Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
And We charged those who received the Scripture before you and We charge you that ye keep your duty toward Allah
And if ye disbelieve lo unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and Allah is ever Absolute Owner of Praise
Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
And Allah is sufficient as Defender
If He will He can remove you O people and produce others in your stead
Allah is Able to do that
Whoso desireth the reward of the world let him know that with Allah is the reward of the world and the Hereafter
Allah is ever Hearer Seer
O ye who believe
Be ye staunch in justice witnesses for Allah even though it be against yourselves or your parents or your kindred whether the case be of a rich man or a poor man for Allah is nearer unto both them ye are
So follow not passion lest ye lapse from truth and if ye lapse or fall away then lo Allah is ever Informed of what ye do
O ye who believe
Believe in Allah and His messenger and the Scripture which He hath revealed unto His messenger and the Scripture which He revealed aforetime
Whoso disbelieveth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers and the Last Day he verily hath wandered far astray
Lo those who believe then disbelieve and then again believe then disbelieve and then increase in disbelief Allah will never pardon them nor will He guide them unto a way
Bear unto the hypocrites the tidings that for them there is a painful doom
Those who chose disbelievers for their friends instead of believers Do they look for power at their hands
Lo all power appertaineth to Allah
He hath already revealed unto you in the Scripture that when ye hear the revelations of Allah rejected and derided ye sit not with them who disbelieve and mock until they engage in some other conversation
Lo in that case if ye stayed ye would be like unto them
Lo Allah will gather hypocrites and disbelievers all together into hell
Those who wait upon occasion in regard to you and if a victory cometh unto you from Allah say Are we not with you and if the disbelievers meet with a success say Had we not the mastery of you and did we not protect you from the believers Allah will judge between you at the Day of Resurrection and Allah will not give the disbelievers any way of success against the believers
Lo the hypocrites seek to beguile Allah but it is He Who beguileth them
When they stand up to worship they perform it languidly and to be seen of men and are mindful of Allah but little
Swaying between this and that belonging neither to these nor to those
He whom Allah causeth to go astray thou O Muhammad wilt not find a way for him
O ye who believe
Choose not disbelievers for your friends in place of believers
Would ye give Allah a clear warrant against you
Lo the hypocrites will be in the lowest deep of the Fire and thou wilt find no helper for them
Save those who repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and make their religion pure for Allah only
Those are with the believers
And Allah will bestow on the believers an immense reward
What concern hath Allah for your punishment if ye are thankful for His mercies and believe in Him
Allah was ever Responsive Aware
Allah loveth not the utterance of harsh speech save by one who hath been wronged
Allah is ever Hearer Knower
If ye do good openly or keep it secret or forgive evil lo Allah is ever Forgiving Powerful
Lo those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and seek to make distinction between Allah and His messengers and say We believe in some and disbelieve in others and seek to choose a way in between
Such are disbelievers in truth and for disbelievers We prepare a shameful doom
But those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them unto them Allah will give their wages and Allah was ever Forgiving Merciful
The people of the Scripture ask of thee that thou shouldst cause an actual Book to descend upon them from heaven
They asked a greater thing of Moses aforetime for they said Show us Allah plainly
The storm of lightning seized them for their wickedness
Then even after that they chose the calf for worship after clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty had come unto them
And We forgave them that And We bestowed on Moses evident authority
And We caused the Mount to tower above them at the taking of their covenant and We bade them Enter the gate prostrate and We bode them Transgress not the Sabbath and We took from them a firm covenant
Then because of their breaking of their covenant and their disbelieving in the revelations of Allah and their slaying of the prophets wrongfully and their saying Our hearts are hardened Nay but Allah set a seal upon them for their disbelief so that they believe not save a few
And because of their disbelief and of their speaking against Mary a tremendous calumny
And because of their saying We slew the Messiah Jesus son of Mary Allah s messenger they slew him not nor crucified him but it appeared so unto them and lo those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture they slew him not for certain
But Allah took him up unto Himself
Allah was ever Mighty Wise
There is not one of the People of the Scripture but will believe in him before his death and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them
Because of the wrongdoing of the Jews We forbade them good things which were before made lawful unto them and because of their much hindering from Allah s way
And of their taking usury when they were forbidden it and of their devouring people s wealth by false pretences We have prepared for those of them who disbelieve a painful doom
But those of them who are firm in knowledge and the believers believe in that which is revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee especially the diligent in prayer and those who pay the poordue the believers in Allah and the Last Day
Upon these We shall bestow immense reward
Lo We inspire thee as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him as We inspired Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon and as We imparted unto David the Psalms
And messengers We have mentioned unto thee before and messengers We have not mentioned unto thee and Allah spake directly unto Moses
Messengers of good cheer and of warning in order that mankind might have no argument against Allah after the messengers
Allah was ever Mighty Wise
But Allah Himself testifieth concerning that which He hath revealeth unto thee in His knowledge hath He revealed it and the angels also testify
And Allah is sufficient Witness
Lo those who disbelieve and hinder others from the way of Allah they verily have wandered far astray
Lo those who disbelieve and deal in wrong Allah will never forgive them neither will He guide them unto a road
Except the road of hell wherein they will abide for ever
And that is ever easy for Allah
O mankind
The messenger hath come unto you with the Truth from your Lord
Therefor believe it is better for you
But if ye disbelieve still lo unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth
Allah is ever Knower Wise
O People of the Scripture
Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning Allah save the truth
The Messiah Jesus son of Mary was only a messenger of Allah and His word which He conveyed unto Mary and a spirit from Him
So believe in Allah and His messengers and say not Three Cease it is better for you Allah is only One Allah
Far is it removed from His Transcendent Majesty that He should have a son
His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
And Allah is sufficient as Defender
The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah nor will the favoured angels
Whoso scorneth His service and is proud all such will He assemble unto Him
Then as for those who believed and did good works unto them will He pay their wages in full adding unto them of His bounty and as for those who were scornful and proud them will He punish with a painful doom
And they will not find for them against Allah any protecting friend or helper
O mankind
Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you and We have sent down unto you a clear light
As for those who believe in Allah and hold fast unto Him them He will cause to enter into His mercy and grace and will guide them unto Him by a straight road
They ask thee for a pronouncement
Say Allah hath pronounced for you concerning distant kindred
If a man die childless and he have a sister hers is half the heritage and he would have inherited from her had she died childless
And if there be two sisters then theirs are twothirds of the heritage and if they be brethren men and women unto the male is the equivalent of the share of two females
Allah expoundeth unto you so that ye err not
Allah is Knower of all things
O ye who believe
Fulfil your indentures
The beast of cattle is made lawful unto you for food except that which is announced unto you herein game being unlawful when ye are on the pilgrimage Lo
Allah ordaineth that which pleaseth Him
O ye who believe
Profane not Allah s monuments nor the Sacred Month nor the offerings nor the garlands nor those repairing to the Sacred House seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord
But when ye have left the sacred territory then go hunting if ye will
And let not your hatred of a folk who once stopped your going to the inviolable place of worship seduce you to transgress but help ye one another unto righteousness and pious duty
Help not one another unto sin and transgression but keep your duty to Allah
Lo
Allah is severe in punishment
Forbidden unto you for food are carrion and blood and swineflesh and that which hath been dedicated unto any other than Allah and the strangled and the dead through beating and the dead through falling from a height and that which hath been killed by the goring of horns and the devoured of wild beasts saving that which ye make lawful by the deathstroke and that which hath been immolated unto idols And forbidden is it that ye swear by the divining arrows
This is an abomination
This day are those who disbelieve in despair of ever harming your religion so fear them not fear Me
This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed My favour unto you and have chosen for you as religion alIslam
Whoso is forced by hunger not by will to sin for him lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
They ask thee O Muhammad what is made lawful for them
Say all good things are made lawful for you And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained as hounds are trained ye teach them that which Allah taught you so eat of that which they catch for you and mention Allah s name upon it and observe your duty to Allah
Lo
Allah is swift to take account
This day are all good things made lawful for you
The food of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them
And so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture before you lawful for you when ye give them their marriage portions and live with them in honour not in fornication nor taking them as secret concubines
Whoso denieth the faith his work is vain and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter
O ye who believe
When ye rise up for prayer wash you faces and your hands up to the elbows and lightly rub your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles
And if ye are unclean purify yourselves
And if ye are sick or on a journey or one of you cometh from the closet or ye have had contact with women and ye find not water then go to clean high ground and rub your faces and your hands with some of it
Allah would not place a burden on you but He would purify you and would perfect His grace upon you that ye may give thanks
Remember Allah s grace upon you and His covenant by which He bound you when ye said We hear and we obey And keep your duty to Allah
Lo
He knoweth what is in the breasts of men
O ye who believe
Be steadfast witnesses for Allah in equity and let not hatred of any people seduce you that ye deal not justly
Deal justly that is nearer to your duty
Observe your duty to Allah
Lo
Allah is Informed of what ye do
Allah hath promised those who believe and do good works Theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward
And they who disbelieve and deny Our revelations such are rightful owners of hell
O ye who believe
Remember Allah s favour unto you how a people were minded to stretch out their hands against you but He withheld their hands from you and keep your duty to Allah
In Allah let believers put their trust
Allah made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We raised among them twelve chieftains and Allah said Lo
I am with you
If ye establish worship and pay the poordue and believe in My messengers and support them and lend unto Allah a kindly loan surely I shall remit your sins and surely I shall bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow
Whoso among you disbelieveth after this will go astray from a plain road
And because of their breaking their covenant We have cursed them and made hard their hearts
They change words from their context and forget a part of that whereof they were admonished
Thou wilt not cease to discover treachery from all save a few of them
But bear with them and pardon them
Lo Allah loveth the kindly
And with those who say Lo we are Christians We made a covenant but they forgot a part of that whereof they were admonished
Therefor We have stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection when Allah will inform them of their handiwork
O People of the Scripture
Now hath Our messenger come unto you expounding unto you much of that which ye used to hide in the Scripture and forgiving much now hath come unto you light from Allah and plain Scripture
Whereby Allah guideth him who seeketh His good pleasure unto paths of peace He bringeth them out of darkness unto light by His decree and guideth them unto a straight path
They indeed have disbelieved who say Lo Allah is the Messiah son of Mary
Say Who then can do aught against Allah if He had willed to destroy the Messiah son of Mary and his mother and everyone on earth
Allah s is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
He createth what He will
And Allah is Able to do all things
The Jews and Christians say We are sons of Allah and His loved ones
Say Why then doth He chastise you for your sins
Nay ye are but mortals of His creating
He forgiveth whom He will and chastiseth whom He will
Allah s is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and unto Him is the journeying
O People of the Scripture
Now hath Our messenger come unto you to make things plain unto you after an interval of cessation of the messengers lest ye should say There came not unto us a messenger of cheer nor any warner
Now hath a messenger of cheer and a warner come unto you
Allah is Able to do all things
And remember when Moses said unto his people O my people
Remember Allah s favour unto you how He placed among you prophets and He made you kings and gave you that which He gave not to any other of His creatures
O my people
Go into the holy land which Allah hath ordained for you Turn not in flight for surely ye turn back as losers
They said O Moses
Lo a giant people dwell therein and lo we go not in till they go forth from thence
When they go forth from thence then we will enter not till then
Then out spake two of those who feared their Lord men unto whom Allah had been gracious Enter in upon them by the gate for if ye enter by it lo ye will be victorious
So put your trust in Allah if ye are indeed believers
They said O Moses
We will never enter the land while they are in it
So go thou and thy Lord and fight
We will sit here
He said My Lord
I have control of none but myself and my brother so distinguish between us and the wrongdoing folk
Their Lord said For this the land will surely be forbidden them for forty years that they will wander in the earth bewildered
So grieve not over the wrongdoing folk
But recite unto them with truth the tale of the two sons of Adam how they offered each a sacrifice and it was accepted from the one of them and it was not accepted from the other
The one said I will surely kill thee
The other answered Allah accepteth only from those who ward off evil
Even if thou stretch out thy hand against me to kill me I shall not stretch out my hand against thee to kill thee lo
I fear Allah the Lord of the Worlds
Lo I would rather thou shouldst bear the punishment of the sin against me and thine own sin and become one of the owners of the fire
That is the reward of evildoers
But the other s mind imposed on him the killing of his brother so he slew him and became one of the losers
Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground to show him how to hide his brother s naked corpse
He said Woe unto me
Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother s naked corpse
And he became repentant
For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth it shall be as if he had killed all mankind and whoso saveth the life of one it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind
Our messengers came unto them of old with clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty but afterwards lo many of them became prodigals in the earth
The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off or will be expelled out of the land
Such will be their degradation in the world and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom
Save those who repent before ye overpower them For know that Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O ye who believe
Be mindful of your duty to Allah and seek the way of approach unto Him and strive in His way in order that ye may succeed
As for those who disbelieve lo if all that is in the earth were theirs and as much again therewith to ransom them from the doom on the Day of Resurrection it would not be accepted from them
Theirs will be a painful doom
They will wish to come forth from the Fire but they will not come forth from it
Theirs will be a lasting doom
As for the thief both male and female cut off their hands It is the reward of their own deeds an exemplary punishment from Allah
Allah is Mighty Wise
But whoso repenteth after his wrongdoing and amendeth lo Allah will relent toward him
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Knowest thou not that unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
He punisheth whom He will and forgiveth whom He will
Allah is Able to do all things
O Messenger
Let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race to disbelief of such as say with their mouths We believe but their hearts believe not and of the Jews listeners for the sake of falsehood listeners on behalf of other folk who come not unto thee changing words from their context and saying If this be given unto you receive it but if this be not given unto you then beware
He whom Allah doometh unto sin thou by thine efforts wilt avail him naught against Allah
Those are they for whom the Will of Allah is that He cleanse not their hearts
Theirs in the world will be ignominy and in the Hereafter an awful doom
Listeners for the sake of falsehood Greedy for illicit gain
If then they have recourse unto thee Muhammad judge between them or disclaim jurisdiction
If thou disclaimest jurisdiction then they cannot harm thee at all
But if thou judgest judge between them with equity
Lo Allah loveth the equitable
How come they unto thee for judgment when they have the Torah wherein Allah hath delivered judgment for them
Yet even after that they turn away
Such folk are not believers
Lo
We did reveal the Torah wherein is guidance and a light by which the prophets who surrendered unto Allah judged the Jews and the rabbis and the priests judged by such of Allah s Scripture as they were bidden to observe and thereunto were they witnesses
So fear not mankind but fear Me
And My revelations for a little gain
Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed such are disbelievers
And We prescribed for them therein The life for the life and the eye for the eye and the nose for the nose and the ear for the ear and the tooth for the tooth and for wounds retaliation
But whoso forgoeth it in the way of charity it shall be expiation for him
Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed such are wrongdoers
And We caused Jesus son of Mary to follow in their footsteps confirming that which was revealed before him in the Torah and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light confirming that which was revealed before it in the Torah a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off evil
Let the People of the Gospel judge by that which Allah hath revealed therein
Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed such are evillivers
And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture with the truth confirming whatever Scripture was before it and a watcher over it
So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed and follow not their desires away from the truth which hath come unto thee
For each We have appointed a divine law and a tracedout way
Had Allah willed He could have made you one community
But that He may try you by that which He hath given you He hath made you as ye are
So vie one with another in good works
Unto Allah ye will all return and He will then inform you of that wherein ye differ
So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed and follow not their desires but beware of them lest they seduce thee from some part of that which Allah hath revealed unto thee
And if they turn away then know that Allah s Will is to smite them for some sin of theirs
Lo many of mankind are evillivers
Is it a judgment of the time of pagan ignorance that they are seeking
Who is better than Allah for judgment to a people who have certainty in their belief
O ye who believe
Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends
They are friends one to another
He among you who taketh them for friends is one of them
Lo Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
And thou seest those in whose heart is a disease race toward them saying We fear lest a change of fortune befall us
And it may happen that Allah will vouchsafe unto thee the victory or a commandment from His presence Then will they repent them of their secret thoughts
Then will the believers say unto the people of the Scripture are these they who swore by Allah their most binding oaths that they were surely with you
Their works have failed and they have become the losers
O ye who believe
Whoso of you becometh a renegade from his religion know that in his stead Allah will bring a people whom He loveth and who love Him humble toward believers stern toward disbelievers striving in the way of Allah and fearing not the blame of any blamer
Such is the grace of Allah which He giveth unto whom He will
Allah is AllEmbracing AllKnowing
Your guardian can be only Allah and His messenger and those who believe who establish worship and pay the poordue and bow down in prayer
And whoso taketh Allah and His messenger and those who believe for guardian will know that lo the party of Allah they are the victorious
O Ye who believe
Choose not for guardians such of those who received the Scripture before you and of the disbelievers as make a jest and sport of your religion
But keep your duty to Allah if ye are true believers
And when ye call to prayer they take it for a jest and sport
That is because they are a folk who understand not
Say O People of the Scripture
Do ye blame us for aught else than that we believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed aforetime and because most of you are evillivers
Shall I tell thee of a worse case than theirs for retribution with Allah
Worse is the case of him whom Allah hath cursed him on whom His wrath hath fallen and of whose sort Allah hath turned some to apes and swine and who serveth idols
Such are in worse plight and further astray from the plain road
When they come unto you Muslims they say We believe but they came in unbelief and they went out in the same and Allah knoweth best what they were hiding
And thou seest many of them vying one with another in sin and transgression and their devouring of illicit gain
Verily evil is what they do
Why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid their evilspeaking and their devouring of illicit gain
Verily evil is their handiwork
The Jews say Allah s hand is fettered
Their hands are fettered and they are accursed for saying so
Nay but both His hands are spread out wide in bounty He bestoweth as He will
That which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them and We have cast among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection
As often as they light a fire for war Allah extinguisheth it
Their effort is for corruption in the land and Allah loveth not corrupters
If only the People of the Scripture would believe and ward off evil surely We should remit their sins from them and surely We should bring them into Gardens of Delight
If they had observed the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto them from their Lord they would surely have been nourished from above them and from beneath their feet
Among them there are people who are moderate but many of them are of evil conduct
O Messenger
Make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord for if thou do it not thou wilt not have conveyed His message
Allah will protect thee from mankind
Lo Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk
Say O People of the Scripture
Ye have naught of guidance till ye observe the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto you from your Lord
That which is revealed unto thee Muhammad from thy Lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them
But grieve not for the disbelieving folk
Lo those who believe and those who are Jews and Sabaeans and Christians Whosoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
We made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We sent unto them messengers
As often as a messenger came unto them with that which their souls desired not they became rebellious Some of them they denied and some they slew
They thought no harm would come of it so they were wilfully blind and deaf
And afterward Allah turned in mercy toward them
Now even after that are many of them wilfully blind and deaf
Allah is Seer of what they do
They surely disbelieve who say Lo Allah is the Messiah son of Mary
The Messiah himself said O Children of Israel worship Allah my Lord and your Lord
Lo whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah for him Allah hath forbidden paradise His abode is the Fire
For evildoers there will be no helpers
They surely disbelieve who say Lo
Allah is the third of three when there is no Allah save the One Allah
If they desist not from so saying a painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve
Will they not rather turn unto Allah and seek forgiveness of Him
For Allah is Forgiving Merciful
The Messiah son of Mary was no other than a messenger messengers the like of whom had passed away before him
And his mother was a saintly woman
And they both used to eat earthly food
See how We make the revelations clear for them and see how they are turned away
Say Serve ye in place of Allah that which possesseth for you neither hurt nor use
Allah it is Who is the Hearer the Knower
Say O People of the Scripture
Stress not in your religion other than the truth and follow not the vain desires of folk who erred of old and led many astray and erred from a plain road
Those of the Children of Israel who went astray were cursed by the tongue of David and of Jesus son of Mary
That was because they rebelled and used to transgress
They restrained not one another from the wickedness they did
Verily evil was that they used to do
Thou seest many of them making friends with those who disbelieve
Surely ill for them is that which they themselves send on before them that Allah will be wroth with them and in the doom they will abide
If they believed in Allah and the Prophet and that which is revealed unto him they would not choose them for their friends
But many of them are of evil conduct
Thou wilt find the most vehement of mankind in hostility to those who believe to be the Jews and the idolaters
And thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe to be those who say Lo We are Christians
That is because there are among them priests and monks and because they are not proud
When they listen to that which hath been revealed unto the messengers thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of their recognition of the Truth
They say Our Lord we believe
Inscribe us as among the witnesses
How should we not believe in Allah and that which hath come unto us of the Truth
And how should we not hope that our Lord will bring us in along with righteous folk
Allah hath rewarded them for that their saying Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever
That is the reward of the good
But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations they are owners of hellfire
O ye who believe
Forbid not the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you and transgress not Lo
Allah loveth not transgressors
Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed on you as food lawful and good and keep your duty to Allah in Whom ye are believers
Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths but He will take you to task for the oaths which ye swear in earnest
The expiation thereof is the feeding of ten of the needy with the average of that wherewith ye feed your own folk or the clothing of them or the liberation of a slave and for him who findeth not the wherewithal to do so then a three days fast
This is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn and keep your oaths
Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations in order that ye may give thanks
O ye who believe
Strong drink and games of chance and idols and divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan s handiwork
Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed
Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong drink and games of chance and to turn you from remembrance of Allah and from His worship
Will ye then have done
Obey Allah and obey the messenger and beware
But if ye turn away then know that the duty of Our messenger is only plain conveyance of the message
There shall be no sin imputed unto those who believe and do good works for what they may have eaten in the past So be mindful of your duty to Allah and believe and do good works and again be mindful of your duty and believe and once again be mindful of your duty and do right
Allah loveth the good
O ye who believe
Allah will surely try you somewhat in the matter of the game which ye take with your hands and your spears that Allah may know him who feareth Him in secret
Whoso transgresseth after this for him there is a painful doom
O ye who believe
Kill no wild game while ye are on the pilgrimage
Whoso of you killeth it of set purpose he shall pay its forfeit in the equivalent of that which he hath killed of domestic animals the judge to be two men among you known for justice the forfeit to be brought as an offering to the Ka bah or for expiation he shall feed poor persons or the equivalent thereof in fasting that he may taste the evil consequences of his deed
Allah forgiveth whatever of this kind may have happened in the past but whoso relapseth Allah will take retribution from him
Allah is Mighty Able to Requite the wrong
To hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you a provision for you and for seafarers but to hunt on land is forbidden you so long as ye are on the pilgrimage
Be mindful of your duty to Allah unto Whom ye will be gathered
Allah hath appointed the Ka bah the Sacred House a standard for mankind and the Sacred Month and the offerings and the garlands
That is so that ye may know that Allah knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and that Allah is Knower of all things
Know that Allah is severe in punishment but that Allah also is Forgiving Merciful
The duty of the messenger is only to convey the message
Allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide
Say The evil and the good are not alike even though the plenty of the evil attract thee
So be mindful of your duty to Allah O men of understanding that ye may succeed
O ye who believe
Ask not of things which if they were made unto you would trouble you but if ye ask of them when the Qur an is being revealed they will be made known unto you
Allah pardoneth this for Allah is Forgiving Clement
A folk before you asked for such disclosures and then disbelieved therein
Allah hath not appointed anything in the nature of a Bahirah or a Sa ibah or a Wasilah or a Hami but those who disbelieve invent a lie against Allah
Most of them have no sense
And when it is said unto them Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the messenger they say Enough for us is that wherein we found our fathers
What Even though their fathers had no knowledge whatsoever and no guidance
O ye who believe
Ye have charge of your own souls
He who erreth cannot injure you if ye are rightly guided
Unto Allah ye will all return and then He will inform you of what ye used to do
O ye who believe
Let there be witnesses between you when death draweth nigh unto one of you at the time of bequest two witnesses just men from among you or two others from another tribe in case ye are campaigning in the land and the calamity of death befall you
Ye shall empanel them both after the prayer and if ye doubt they shall be made to swear by Allah saying We will not take a bribe even though it were on behalf of a near kinsman nor will we hide the testimony of Allah for then indeed we should be of the sinful
But then if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit the suspicion of sin let two others take their place of those nearly concerned and let them swear by Allah saying Verily our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed the bounds of duty for them indeed we should be of the evildoers
Thus it is more likely that they will bear true witness or fear that after their oaths the oaths of others will be taken
So be mindful of your duty to Allah and hearken
Allah guideth not the froward folk
In the day when Allah gathereth together the messengers and saith What was your response from mankind they say We have no knowledge Lo
Thou only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden
When Allah saith O Jesus son of Mary Remember My favour unto thee and unto thy mother how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity and how I taught thee the Scripture and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel and how thou didst shape of clay as it were the likeness of a bird by My permission and didst blow upon it and it was a bird by My permission and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by My permission and how thou didst raise the dead by My permission and how I restrained the Children of Israel from harming thee when thou camest unto them with clear proofs and those of them who disbelieved exclaimed This is naught else than mere magic
And when I inspired the disciples saying Believe in Me and in My messenger they said We believe
Bear witness that we have surrendered unto Thee we are muslims
When the disciples said O Jesus son of Mary
Is thy Lord able to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven
He said Observe your duty to Allah if ye are true believers
They said We wish to eat thereof that we may satisfy our hearts and know that thou hast spoken truth to us and that thereof we may be witnesses
Jesus son of Mary said O Allah Lord of us
Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven that it may be a feast for us for the first of us and for the last of us and a sign from Thee
Give us sustenance for Thou art the Best of Sustainers
Allah said Lo I send it down for you
And whoso disbelieveth of you afterward him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished any of My creatures
And when Allah saith O Jesus son of Mary
Didst thou say unto mankind Take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah he saith Be glorified
It was not mine to utter that to which I had no right
If I used to say it then Thou knewest it
Thou knowest what is in my mind and I know not what is in Thy Mind Lo
Thou only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden
I spake unto them only that which Thou commandedst me saying Worship Allah my Lord and your Lord
I was a witness of them while I dwelt among them and when Thou tookest me Thou wast the Watcher over them
Thou art Witness over all things
If Thou punish them lo they are Thy slaves and if Thou forgive them lo they are Thy slaves
Lo Thou only Thou art the Mighty the Wise
Allah saith This is a day in which their truthfulness profiteth the truthful for theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they are secure for ever Allah taking pleasure in them and they in Him
That is the great triumph
Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is therein and He is Able to do all things
Praise be to Allah Who hath created the heavens and the earth and hath appointed darkness and light
Yet those who disbelieve ascribe rivals unto their Lord
He it is Who hath created you from clay and hath decreed a term for you
A term is fixed with Him
Yet still ye doubt
He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth
He knoweth both your secret and your utterance and He knoweth what ye earn
Never came there unto them a revelation of the revelations of Allah but they did turn away from it
And they denied the truth when it came unto them
But there will come unto them the tidings of that which they used to deride
See they not how many a generation We destroyed before them whom We had established in the earth more firmly than We have established you and We shed on them abundant showers from the sky and made the rivers flow beneath them
Yet we destroyed them for their sins and created after them another generation
Had we sent down unto thee Muhammad actual writing upon parchment so that they could feel it with their hands those who disbelieve would have said This is naught else than mere magic
They say Why hath not an angel been sent down unto him
If We sent down an angel then the matter would be judged no further time would be allowed them for reflection
Had we appointed him Our messenger an angel We assuredly had made him as a man that he might speak to men and thus obscured for them the truth they now obscure
Messengers of Allah have been derided before thee but that whereat they scoffed surrounded such of them as did deride
Say unto the disbelievers Travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters
Say Unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth
Say Unto Allah
He hath prescribed for Himself mercy that He may bring you all together to the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt
Those who ruin their souls will not believe
Unto Him belongeth whatsoever resteth in the night and the day
He is the Hearer the Knower
Say Shall I choose for a protecting friend other than Allah the Originator of the heavens and the earth Who feedeth and is never fed
Say I am ordered to be the first to surrender unto Him
And be not thou O Muhammad of the idolaters
Say I fear if I rebel against my Lord the retribution of an Awful Day
He from whom such retribution is averted on that day Allah hath in truth had mercy on him
That will be the signal triumph
If Allah touch thee with affliction there is none that can relieve therefrom save Him and if He touch thee with good fortune there is none that can impair it for He is Able to do all things
He is the Omnipotent over His slaves and He is the Wise the Knower
Say O Muhammad What thing is of most weight in testimony
Say Allah is Witness between me and you
And this Qur an hath been inspired in me that I may warn therewith you and whomsoever it may reach
Do ye in sooth bear witness that there are gods beside Allah
Say I bear no such witness
Say He is only One Allah
Lo I am innocent of that which ye associate with Him
Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise this revelation as they recognise their sons
Those who ruin their own souls will not believe
Who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or denieth His revelations
Lo the wrongdoers will not be successful
And on the day We gather them together We shall say unto those who ascribed partners unto Allah Where are now those partners of your makebelieve
Then will they have no contention save that they will say By Allah our Lord we never were idolaters
See how they lie against themselves and how the thing which they devised hath failed them
Of them are some who listen unto thee but We have placed upon their hearts veils lest they should understand and in their ears a deafness If they saw every token they would not believe therein to the point that when they come unto thee to argue with thee the disbelievers say This is naught else than fables of the men of old
And they forbid men from it and avoid it and they ruin none save themselves though they perceive not
If thou couldst see when they are set before the Fire and say Oh would that we might return
Then would we not deny the revelations of our Lord but we would be of the believers
Nay but that hath become clear unto them which before they used to hide
And if they were sent back they would return unto that which they are forbidden
Lo they are liars
And they say There is naught save our life of the world and we shall not be raised again
If thou couldst see when they are set before their Lord
He will say Is not this real
They will say Yea verily by our Lord
He will say Taste now the retribution for that ye used to disbelieve
They indeed are losers who deny their meeting with Allah until when the Hour cometh on them suddenly they cry Alas for us that we neglected it They bear upon their backs their burdens
Ah evil is that which they bear
Naught is the life of the world save a pastime and a sport
Better far is the abode of the Hereafter for those who keep their duty to Allah
Have ye then no sense
We know well how their talk grieveth thee though in truth they deny not thee Muhammad but evildoers flout the revelations of Allah
Messengers indeed have been denied before thee and they were patient under the denial and the persecution till Our succour reached them
There is none to alter the decisions of Allah
Already there hath reached thee somewhat of the tidings of the messengers We sent before
And if their aversion is grievous unto thee then if thou canst seek a way down into the earth or a ladder unto the sky that thou mayst bring unto them a portent to convince them all If Allah willed He could have brought them all together to the guidance So be not thou among the foolish ones
Only those can accept who hear
As for the dead Allah will raise them up then unto Him they will be returned
They say Why hath no portent been sent down upon him from his Lord
Say Lo Allah is Able to send down a portent
But most of them know not
There is not an animal in the earth nor a flying creature flying on two wings but they are peoples like unto you
We have neglected nothing in the Book of Our decrees
Then unto their Lord they will be gathered
Those who deny Our revelations are deaf and dumb in darkness
Whom Allah will sendeth astray and whom He will He placeth on a straight path
Say Can ye see yourselves if the punishment of Allah come upon you or the Hour come upon you calling upon other than Allah Do ye then call for help to any other than Allah
Nay but unto Him ye call and He removeth that because of which ye call unto Him if He will and ye forget whatever partners ye ascribed unto Him
We have sent already unto peoples that were before thee and We visited them with tribulation and adversity in order that they might grow humble
If only when Our disaster came on them they had been humble
But their hearts were hardened and the devil made all that they used to do seem fair unto them
Then when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded We opened unto them the gates of all things till even as they were rejoicing in that which they were given We seized them unawares and lo they were dumbfounded
So of the people who did wrong the last remnant was cut off
Praise be to Allah Lord of the Worlds
Say Have ye imagined if Allah should take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts Who is the Allah Who could restore it to you save Allah
See how We display the revelations unto them Yet still they turn away
Say Can ye see yourselves if the punishment of Allah come upon you unawares or openly Would any perish save wrongdoing folk
We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners
Whoso believeth and doeth right there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
But as for those who deny Our revelations torment will afflict them for that they used to disobey
Say O Muhammad to the disbelievers I say not unto you that I possess the treasures of Allah nor that I have knowledge of the Unseen and I say not unto you Lo
I am an angel
I follow only that which is inspired in me
Say Are the blind man and the seer equal
Will ye not then take thought
Warn hereby those who fear because they know that they will be gathered unto their Lord for whom there is no protecting ally nor intercessor beside Him that they may ward off evil
Repel not those who call upon their Lord at morn and evening seeking His Countenance
Thou art not accountable for them in aught nor are they accountable for thee in aught that thou shouldst repel them and be of the wrongdoers
And even so do We try some of them by others that they say Are these they whom Allah favoureth among us
Is not Allah best Aware of the thanksgivers
And when those who believe in Our revelations come unto thee say Peace be unto you
Your Lord hath prescribed for Himself mercy that whoso of you doeth evil through ignorance and repenteth afterward thereof and doeth right for him lo
He is Forgiving Merciful
Thus do We expound the revelations that the way of the unrighteous may be manifest
Say I am forbidden to worship those on whom ye call instead of Allah
Say I will not follow your desires for then should I go astray and I should not be of the rightly guided
Say I am relying on clear proof from my Lord while ye deny Him
I have not that for which ye are impatient
The decision is for Allah only
He telleth the truth and He is the Best of Deciders
Say If I had that for which ye are impatient then would the case ere this have been decided between me and you
Allah is Best Aware of the wrongdoers
And with Him are the keys of the Invisible
None but He knoweth them
And He knoweth what is in the land and the sea
Not a leaf falleth but He knoweth it not a grain amid the darkness of the earth naught of wet or dry but it is noted in a clear record
He it is Who gathereth you at night and knoweth that which ye commit by day
Then He raiseth you again to life therein that the term appointed for you may be accomplished
And afterward unto Him is your return
Then He will proclaim unto you what ye used to do
He is the Omnipotent over His slaves
He sendeth guardians over you until when death cometh unto one of you Our messengers receive him and they neglect not
Then are they restored unto Allah their Lord the Just
Surely His is the judgment And He is the most swift of reckoners
Say Who delivereth you from the darkness of the land and the sea Ye call upon Him humbly and in secret saying If we are delivered from this fear we truly will be of the thankful
Say Allah delivereth you from this and from all affliction
Yet ye attribute partners unto Him
Say He is able to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet or to bewilder you with dissension and make you taste the tyranny one of another
See how We display the revelations so that they may understand
Thy people O Muhammad have denied it though it is the Truth
Say I am not put in charge of you
For every announcement there is a term and ye will come to know
And when thou seest those who meddle with Our revelations withdraw from them until they meddle with another topic
And if the devil cause thee to forget sit not after the remembrance with the congregation of wrongdoers
Those who ward off evil are not accountable for them in aught but the Reminder must be given them that haply they too may ward off evil
And forsake those who take their religion for a pastime and a jest and whom the life of the world beguileth
Remind mankind hereby lest a soul be destroyed by what it earneth
It hath beside Allah no protecting ally nor intercessor and though it offer every compensation it will not be accepted from it
Those are they who perish by their own deserts
For them is drink of boiling water and a painful doom because they disbelieved
Say Shall we cry instead of unto Allah unto that which neither profiteth us nor hurteth us and shall we turn back after Allah hath guided us like one bewildered whom the devils have infatuated in the earth who hath companions who invite him to the guidance saying Come unto us
Say Lo the guidance of Allah is Guidance and we are ordered to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds
And to establish worship and be dutiful to Him and He it is unto Whom ye will be gathered
He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth
In the day when He saith Be it is
His Word is the Truth and His will be the Sovereignty on the day when the trumpet is blown
Knower of the Invisible and the Visible He is the Wise the Aware
Remember when Abraham said unto his father Azar Takest thou idols for gods
Lo I see thee and thy folk in error manifest
Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might be of those possessing certainty
When the night grew dark upon him he beheld a star He said This is my Lord
But when it set he said I love not things that set
And when he saw the moon uprising he exclaimed This is my Lord
But when it set he said Unless my Lord guide me I surely shall become one of the folk who are astray
And when he saw the sun uprising he cried This is my Lord This is greater
And when it set he exclaimed O my people
Lo I am free from all that ye associate with Him
Lo I have turned my face toward Him Who created the heavens and the earth as one by nature upright and I am not of the idolaters
His people argued with him
He said Dispute ye with me concerning Allah when He hath guided me
I fear not at all that which ye set up beside Him unless my Lord willeth aught
My Lord includeth all things in His knowledge
Will ye not then remember
How should I fear that which ye set up beside Him when ye fear not to set up beside Allah that for which He hath revealed unto you no warrant
Which of the two factions hath more right to safety Answer me that if ye have knowledge
Those who believe and obscure not their belief by wrongdoing theirs is safety and they are rightly guided
That is Our argument We gave it unto Abraham against his folk
We raise unto degrees of wisdom whom We will
Lo thy Lord is Wise Aware
And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob each of them We guided and Noah did We guide aforetime and of his seed We guided David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron Thus do We reward the good
And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias
Each one of them was of the righteous
And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot
Each one of them did We prefer above Our creatures
With some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren and We chose them and guided them unto a straight path
Such is the guidance of Allah wherewith He guideth whom He will of His bondmen
But if they had set up for worship aught beside Him all that they did would have been vain
Those are they unto whom We gave the Scripture and command and prophethood
But if these disbelieve therein then indeed We shall entrust it to a people who will not be disbelievers therein
Those are they whom Allah guideth so follow their guidance
Say O Muhammad unto mankind I ask of you no fee for it
Lo it is naught but a Reminder to His creatures
And they measure not the power of Allah its true measure when they say Allah hath naught revealed unto a human being
Say unto the Jews who speak thus Who revealed the Book which Moses brought a light and guidance for mankind which ye have put on parchments which ye show but ye hide much thereof and by which ye were taught that which ye knew not yourselves nor did your fathers know it
Say Allah
Then leave them to their play of cavilling
And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed confirming that which was revealed before it that thou mayst warn the Mother of Villages and those around her
Those who believe in the Hereafter believe herein and they are careful of their worship
Who is guilty of more wrong than he who forgeth a lie against Allah or saith I am inspired when he is not inspired in aught and who saith I will reveal the like of that which Allah hath revealed
If thou couldst see when the wrongdoers reach the pangs of death and the angels stretch their hands out saying Deliver up your souls
This day ye are awarded doom of degradation for that ye spake concerning Allah other than the truth and used to scorn His portents
Now have ye come unto Us solitary as We did create you at the first and ye have left behind you all that We bestowed upon you and We behold not with you those your intercessors of whom ye claimed that they possessed a share in you
Now is the bond between you severed and that which ye presumed hath failed you
Lo Allah it is Who splitteth the grain of corn and the datestone for sprouting
He bringeth forth the living from the dead and is the bringerforth of the dead from the living
Such is Allah
How then are ye perverted
He is the Cleaver of the Daybreak and He hath appointed the night for stillness and the sun and the moon for reckoning
That is the measuring of the Mighty the Wise
And He it is Who hath set for you the stars that ye may guide your course by them amid the darkness of the land and the sea
We have detailed Our revelations for a people who have knowledge
And He it is Who hath produced you from a single being and hath given you a habitation and a repository
We have detailed Our revelations for a people who have understanding
He it is Who sendeth down water from the sky and therewith We bring forth buds of every kind We bring forth the green blade from which We bring forth the thickclustered grain and from the datepalm from the pollen thereof spring pendant bunches and We bring forth gardens of grapes and the olive and the pomegranate alike and unlike
Look upon the fruit thereof when they bear fruit and upon its ripening
Lo herein verily are portents for a people who believe
Yet they ascribe as partners unto Him the jinn although He did create them and impute falsely without knowledge sons and daughters unto Him
Glorified be He and High Exalted above all that they ascribe unto Him
The Originator of the heavens and the earth
How can He have a child when there is for Him no consort when He created all things and is Aware of all things
Such is Allah your Lord
There is no Allah save Him the Creator of all things so worship Him
And He taketh care of all things
Vision comprehendeth Him not but He comprehendeth all vision
He is the Subtile the Aware
Proofs have come unto you from your Lord so whoso seeth it is for his own good and whoso is blind is blind to his own hurt
And I am not a keeper over you
Thus do We display Our revelations that they may say unto thee Muhammad Thou hast studied and that We may make it clear for people who have knowledge
Follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord there is no Allah save Him and turn away from the idolaters
Had Allah willed they had not been idolatrous
We have not set thee as a keeper over them nor art thou responsible for them
Revile not those unto whom they pray beside Allah lest they wrongfully revile Allah through ignorance
Thus unto every nation have We made their deed seem fair
Then unto their Lord is their return and He will tell them what they used to do
And they swear a solemn oath by Allah that if there come unto them a portent they will believe therein
Say Portents are with Allah and so is that which telleth you that if such came unto them they would not believe
We confound their hearts and their eyes As they believed not therein at the first We let them wander blindly on in their contumacy
And though We should send down the angels unto them and the dead should speak unto them and We should gather against them all things in array they would not believe unless Allah so willed
Howbeit most of them are ignorant
Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an adversary devils of humankind and jinn who inspire in one another plausible discourse through guile
If thy Lord willed they would not do so so leave them alone with their devising
That the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter may incline thereto and that they may take pleasure therein and that they may earn what they are earning
Shall I seek other than Allah for judge when He it is Who hath revealed unto you this Scripture fully explained
Those unto whom We gave the Scripture aforetime know that it is revealed from thy Lord in truth
So be not thou O Muhammad of the waverers
Perfected is the Word of thy Lord in truth and justice
There is naught that can change His words
He is the Hearer the Knower
If thou obeyedst most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from Allah s way
They follow naught but an opinion and they do but guess
Lo thy Lord He knoweth best who erreth from His way and He knoweth best who are the rightly guided
Eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been mentioned if ye are believers in His revelations
How should ye not eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been mentioned when He hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you unless ye are compelled thereto
But lo many are led astray by their own lusts through ignorance
Lo thy Lord He is Best Aware of the transgressors
Forsake the outwardness of sin and the inwardness thereof
Lo those who garner sin will be awarded that which they have earned
And eat not of that whereon Allah s name hath not been mentioned for lo it is abomination
Lo the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you
But if ye obey them ye will be in truth idolaters
Is he who was dead and We have raised him unto life and set for him a light wherein he walketh among men as him whose similitude is in utter darkness whence he cannot emerge
Thus is their conduct made fairseeming for the disbelievers
And thus have We made in every city great ones of its wicked ones that they should plot therein
They do but plot against themselves though they perceive not
And when a token cometh unto them they say We will not believe till we are given that which Allah s messengers are given
Allah knoweth best with whom to place His message
Humiliation from Allah and heavy punishment will smite the guilty for their scheming
And whomsoever it is Allah s will to guide He expandeth his bosom unto the Surrender and whomsoever it is His Will to send astray He maketh his bosom close and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent
Thus Allah layeth ignominy upon those who believe not
This is the path of thy Lord a straight path
We have detailed Our revelations for a people who take heed
For them is the abode of peace with their Lord
He will be their Protecting Friend because of what they used to do
In the day when He will gather them together He will say O ye assembly of the jinn
Many of humankind did ye seduce
And their adherents among humankind will say Our Lord
We enjoyed one another but now we have arrived at the appointed term which Thou appointedst for us
He will say Fire is your home
Abide therein for ever save him whom Allah willeth to deliver
Lo thy Lord is Wise Aware
Thus We let some of the wrongdoers have power over others because of what they are wont to earn
O ye assembly of the jinn and humankind
Came there not unto you messengers of your own who recounted unto you My tokens and warned you of the meeting of this your Day
They will say We testify against ourselves
And the life of the world beguiled them And they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers
This is because thy Lord destroyeth not the townships arbitrarily while their people are unconscious of the wrong they do
For all there will be ranks from what they did
Thy Lord is not unaware of what they do
Thy Lord is the Absolute the Lord of Mercy
If He will He can remove you and can cause what He will to follow after you even as He raised you from the seed of other folk
Lo that which ye are promised will surely come to pass and ye cannot escape
Say O Muhammad O my people
Work according to your power
Lo I too am working
Thus ye will come to know for which of us will be the happy sequel
Lo the wrongdoers will not be successful
They assign unto Allah of the crops and cattle which He created a portion and they say This is Allah s in their makebelieve and this is for His partners in regard to us
Thus that which they assign unto His partners in them reacheth not Allah and that which they assign unto Allah goeth to their socalled partners
Evil is their ordinance
Thus have their socalled partners of Allah made the killing of their children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters that they may ruin them and make their faith obscure for them
Had Allah willed it otherwise they had not done so
So leave them alone with their devices
And they say Such cattle and crops are forbidden
Noone is to eat of them save whom we will in their makebelieve cattle whose backs are forbidden cattle over which they mention not the name of Allah
All that is a lie against Him
He will repay them for that which they invent
And they say That which is in the bellies of such cattle is reserved for our males and is forbidden to our wives but if it be born dead then they all may be partakers thereof
He will reward them for their attribution of such ordinances unto Him
Lo He is Wise Aware
They are losers who besottedly have slain their children without knowledge and have forbidden that which Allah bestowed upon them inventing a lie against Allah
They indeed have gone astray and are not guided
He it is Who produceth gardens trellised and untrellised and the datepalm and crops of divers flavour and the olive and the pomegranate like and unlike
Eat ye of the fruit thereof when it fruiteth and pay the due thereof upon the harvest day and be not prodigal
Lo Allah loveth not the prodigals
And of the cattle He produceth some for burdens some for food
Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed upon you and follow not the footsteps of the devil for lo he is an open foe to you
Eight pairs Of the sheep twain and of the goats twain
Say Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain
Expound to me the case with knowledge if ye are truthful
And of the camels twain and of the oxen twain
Say Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain or were ye by to witness when Allah commanded you all this
Then who doth greater wrong than he who deviseth a lie concerning Allah that he may lead mankind astray without knowledge
Lo Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
Say I find not in that which is revealed unto me aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof except it be carrion or blood poured forth or swineflesh for that verily is foul or the abomination which was immolated to the name of other than Allah
But whoso is compelled thereto neither craving nor transgressing for him lo thy Lord is Forgiving Merciful
Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws
And of the oxen and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof save that upon the backs or the entrails or that which is mixed with the bone
That we awarded them for their rebellion
And lo we verily are truthful
So if they give the lie to thee Muhammad say Your Lord is a Lord of AllEmbracing Mercy and His wrath will never be withdrawn from guilty folk
They who are idolaters will say Had Allah willed we had not ascribed unto Him partners neither had our fathers nor had we forbidden aught
Thus did those who were before them give the lie to Allah s messengers till they tasted of the fear of Us
Say Have ye any knowledge that ye can adduce for Us
Lo ye follow naught but an opinion Lo ye do but guess
Say For Allah s is the final argument Had He willed He could indeed have guided all of you
Say Come bring your witnesses who can bear witness that Allah forbade all this
And if they bear witness do not thou bear witness with them
Follow thou not the whims of those who deny Our revelations those who believe not in the Hereafter and deem others equal with their Lord
Say Come I will recite unto you that which your Lord hath made a sacred duty for you That ye ascribe no thing as partner unto Him and that ye do good to parents and that ye slay not your children because of penury We provide for you and for them and that ye draw not nigh to lewd things whether open or concealed
And that ye slay not the life which Allah hath made sacred save in the course of justice
This He hath command you in order that ye may discern
And approach not the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he reach maturity
Give full measure and full weight in justice
We task not any soul beyond its scope
And if ye give your word do justice thereunto even though it be against a kinsman and fulfil the covenant of Allah
This He commandeth you that haply ye may remember
And He commandeth you saying This is My straight path so follow it
Follow not other ways lest ye be parted from His way
This hath He ordained for you that ye may ward off evil
Again We gave the Scripture unto Moses complete for him who would do good an explanation of all things a guidance and a mercy that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord
And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed
So follow it and ward off evil that ye may find mercy
Lest ye should say The Scripture was revealed only to two sects before us and we in sooth were unaware of what they read
Or lest ye should say If the Scripture had been revealed unto us we surely had been better guided than are they
Now hath there come unto you a clear proof from your Lord a guidance and mercy and who doeth greater wrong than he who denieth the revelations of Allah and turneth away from them
We award unto those who turn away from Our revelations an evil doom because of their aversion
Wait they indeed for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them or thy Lord should come or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord
In the day when one of the portents from thy Lord cometh its belief availeth naught a soul which theretofore believed not nor in its belief earned good by works Say Wait ye
Lo We too are waiting
Lo As for those who sunder their religion and become schismatics no concern at all hast thou with them
Their case will go to Allah Who then will tell them what they used to do
Whoso bringeth a good deed will receive tenfold the like thereof while whoso bringeth an illdeed will be awarded but the like thereof and they will not be wronged
Say Lo As for me my Lord hath guided me unto a straight path a right religion the community of Abraham the upright who was no idolater
Say Lo my worship and my sacrifice and my living and my dying are for Allah Lord of the Worlds
He hath no partner
This am I commanded and I am first of those who surrender unto Him
Say Shall I seek another than Allah for Lord when He is Lord of all things
Each soul earneth only on its own account nor doth any laden bear another s load
Then unto your Lord is your return and He will tell you that wherein ye differed
He it is Who hath placed you as viceroys of the earth and hath exalted some of you in rank above others that He may try you by the test of that which He hath given you
Lo Thy Lord is swift in prosecution and Lo
He verily is Forgiving Merciful
Alif
Lam
Mim
Sad
It is a Scripture that is revealed unto thee Muhammad so let there be no heaviness in thy heart therefrom that thou mayst warn thereby and it is a Reminder unto believers
Saying Follow that which is sent down unto you from your Lord and follow no protecting friends beside Him
Little do ye recollect
How many a township have We destroyed
As a raid by night or while they slept at noon Our terror came unto them
No plea had they when Our terror came unto them save that they said Lo We were wrongdoers
Then verily We shall question those unto whom Our message hath been sent and verily We shall question the messengers
Then verily We shall narrate unto them the event with knowledge for We were not absent when it came to pass
The weighing on that day is the true weighing
As for those whose scale is heavy they are the successful
And as for those whose scale is light those are they who lose their souls because they used to wrong Our revelations
And We have given you mankind power in the earth and appointed for you therein livelihoods
Little give ye thanks
And We created you then fashioned you then told the angels Fall ye prostrate before Adam
And they fell prostrate all save Iblis who was not of those who make prostration
He said What hindered thee that thou didst not fall prostrate when I bade thee
Iblis said I am better than him
Thou createdst me of fire while him Thou didst create of mud
He said Then go down hence
It is not for thee to show pride here so go forth
Lo thou art of those degraded
He said Reprieve me till the day when they are raised from the dead
He said Lo thou art of those reprieved
He said Now because Thou hast sent me astray verily I shall lurk in ambush for them on Thy Right Path
Then I shall come upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right hands and from their left hands and Thou wilt not find most of them beholden unto Thee
He said Go forth from hence degraded banished
As for such of them as follow thee surely I will fill hell with all of you
And unto man O Adam
Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden and eat from whence ye will but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrongdoers
Then Satan whispered to them that he might manifest unto them that which was hidden from them of their shame and he said Your Lord forbade you from this tree only lest ye should become angels or become of the immortals
And he swore unto them saying Lo I am a sincere adviser unto you
Thus did he lead them on with guile
And when they tasted of the tree their shame was manifest to them and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden
And their Lord called them saying Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you Lo Satan is an open enemy to you
They said Our Lord
We have wronged ourselves
If thou forgive us not and have not mercy on us surely we are of the lost
He said Go down from hence one of you a foe unto the other
There will be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a while
He said There shall ye live and there shall ye die and thence shall ye be brought forth
O Children of Adam
We have revealed unto you raiment to conceal your shame and splendid vesture but the raiment of restraint from evil that is best
This is of the revelations of Allah that they may remember
O Children of Adam
Let not Satan seduce you as he caused your first parents to go forth from the Garden and tore off from them their robe of innocence that he might manifest their shame to them
Lo he seeth you he and his tribe from whence ye see him not Lo
We have made the devils protecting friends for those who believe not
And when they do some lewdness they say We found our fathers doing it and Allah hath enjoined it on us
Say Allah verily enjoineth not lewdness
Tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not
Say My Lord enjoineth justice
And set your faces upright toward Him at every place of worship and call upon Him making religion pure for Him only
As He brought you into being so return ye unto Him
A party hath He led aright while error hath just hold over another party for lo they choose the devils for protecting supporters instead of Allah and deem that they are rightly guided
O Children of Adam
Look to your adornment at every place of worship and eat and drink but be not prodigal Lo
He loveth not the prodigals
Say Who hath forbidden the adornment of Allah which He hath brought forth for His bondmen and the good things of His providing
Say Such on the Day of Resurrection will be only for those who believed during the life of the world
Thus do we detail Our revelations for people who have knowledge
Say My Lord forbiddeth only indecencies such of them as are apparent and such as are within and sin and wrongful oppression and that ye associate with Allah that for which no warrant hath been revealed and that ye tell concerning Allah that which ye know not
And every nation hath its term and when its term cometh they cannot put it off an hour nor yet advance it
O Children of Adam
When messengers of your own come unto you who narrate unto you My revelations then whosoever refraineth from evil and amendeth there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
But they who deny Our revelations and scorn them each are rightful owners of the Fire they will abide therein
Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah or denieth Our tokens
For such their appointed portion of the Book of destiny reacheth them till when Our messengers come to gather them they say Where now is that to which ye cried beside Allah
They say They have departed from us And they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers
He saith Enter into the Fire among nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before you
Every time a nation entereth it curseth its sister nation till when they have all been made to follow one another thither the last of them saith unto the first of them Our Lord
These led us astray so give them double torment of the Fire
He saith For each one there is double torment but ye know not
And the first of them saith unto the last of them Ye were no whit better than us so taste the doom for what ye used to earn
Lo they who deny Our revelations and scorn them for them the gates of heaven will nor be opened not will they enter the Garden until the camel goeth through the needle s eye
Thus do We requite the guilty
Theirs will be a bed of hell and over them coverings of hell
Thus do We requite wrongdoers
But as for those who believe and do good works We tax not any soul beyond its scope Such are rightful owners of the Garden
They abide therein
And We remove whatever rancour may be in their hearts
Rivers flow beneath them
And they say The praise to Allah Who hath guided us to this
We could not truly have been led aright if Allah had not guided us
Verily the messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth
And it is cried unto them This is the Garden Ye inherit it for what ye used to do
And the dwellers of the Garden cry unto the dwellers of the Fire We have found that which our Lord promised us to be the Truth
Have ye too found that which your Lord promised the Truth
They say Yea verily
And a crier in between them crieth The curse of Allah is on evildoers
Who debar men from the path of Allah and would have it crooked and who are disbelievers in the Last Day
Between them is a veil And on the Heights are men who know them all by their marks
And they call unto the dwellers of the Garden Peace be unto you They enter it not although they hope to enter
And when their eyes are turned toward the dwellers of the Fire they say Our Lord Place us not with the wrongdoing folk
And the dwellers on the Heights call unto men whom they know by their marks saying What did your multitude and that in which ye took your pride avail you
Are these they of whom ye swore that Allah would not show them mercy
Unto them it hath been said Enter the Garden
No fear shall come upon you nor is it ye who will grieve
And the dwellers of the Fire cry out unto the dwellers of the Garden Pour on us some water or some wherewith Allah hath provided you
They say Lo Allah hath forbidden both to disbelievers in His guidance
Who took their religion for a sport and pastime and whom the life of the world beguiled
So this day We have forgotten them even as they forgot the meeting of this their Day and as they used to deny Our tokens
Verily We have brought them a Scripture which We expounded with knowledge a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
Await they aught save the fulfilment thereof
On the day when the fulfilment thereof cometh those who were before forgetful thereof will say The messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth
Have we any intercessors that they may intercede for us
Or can we be returned to life on earth that we may act otherwise than we used to act
They have lost their souls and that which they devised hath failed them
Lo your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days then mounted He the Throne
He covereth the night with the day which is in haste to follow it and hath made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by His command
His verily is all creation and commandment
Blessed be Allah the Lord of the Worlds
O mankind Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret
Lo He loveth not aggressors
Work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering thereof and call on Him in fear and hope
Lo the mercy of Allah is nigh unto the good
And He it is Who sendeth the winds as tidings heralding His mercy till when they bear a cloud heavy with rain We lead it to a dead land and then cause water to descend thereon and thereby bring forth fruits of every kind
Thus bring We forth the dead
Haply ye may remember
As for the good land its vegetation cometh forth by permission of its Lord while as for that which is bad only the useless cometh forth from it
Thus do We recount the tokens for people who give thanks
We sent Noah of old unto his people and he said O my people
Serve Allah
Ye have no other Allah save Him Lo
I fear for you the retribution of an Awful Day
The chieftains of his people said Lo we see thee surely in plain error
He said O my people
There is no error in me but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds
I convey unto you the messages of my Lord and give good counsel unto you and know from Allah that which ye know not
Marvel ye that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by means of a man among you that he may warn you and that ye may keep from evil and that haply ye may find mercy
But they denied him so We saved him and those with him in the ship and We drowned those who denied Our tokens
Lo they were blind folk
And unto the tribe of A ad We sent their brother Hud
He said O my people
Serve Allah
Ye have no other Allah save Him
Will ye not ward off evil
The chieftains of his people who were disbelieving said Lo we surely see thee in foolishness and lo we deem thee of the liars
He said O my people
There is no foolishness in me but I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds
I convey unto you the messages of my Lord and am for you a true adviser
Marvel ye that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by means of a man among you that he may warn you
Remember how He made you viceroys after Noah s folk and gave you growth of stature
Remember all the bounties of your Lord that haply ye may be successful
They said Hast come unto us that we should serve Allah alone and forsake what our fathers worshipped
Then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful
He said Terror and wrath from your Lord have already fallen on you
Would ye wrangle with me over names which ye have named ye and your fathers for which no warrant from Allah hath been revealed
Then await the consequence lo
I also am of those awaiting it
And We saved him and those with him by a mercy from Us and We cut the root of those who denied Our revelations and were not believers
And to the tribe of Thamud We sent their brother Salih
He said O my people
Serve Allah
Ye have no other Allah save Him
A wonder from your Lord hath come unto you
Lo this is the camel of Allah a token unto you so let her feed in Allah s earth and touch her not with hurt lest painful torment seize you
And remember how He made you viceroys after A ad and gave you station in the earth
Ye choose castles in the plains and hew the mountains into dwellings
So remember all the bounties of Allah and do not evil making mischief in the earth
The chieftains of his people who were scornful said unto those whom they despised unto such of them as believed Know ye that Salih is one sent from his Lord
They said Lo In that wherewith he hath been sent we are believers
Those who were scornful said Lo in that which ye believe we are disbelievers
So they hamstrung the shecamel and they flouted the commandment of their Lord and they said O Salih
Bring upon us that thou threatenest if thou art indeed of those sent from Allah
So the earthquake seized them and morning found them prostrate in their dwellingplace
And Salih turned from them and said O my people
I delivered my Lord s message unto you and gave you good advice but ye love not good advisers
And Lot
Remember when he said unto his folk Will ye commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you
Lo ye come with lust unto men instead of women
Nay but ye are wanton folk
And the answer of his people was only that they said one to another Turn them out of your township They are folk forsooth who keep pure
And We rescued him and his household save his wife who was of those who stayed behind
And We rained a rain upon them
See now the nature of the consequence of evildoers
And unto Midian We sent their brother Shu eyb
He said O my people
Serve Allah
Ye have no other Allah save Him
Lo a clear proof hath come unto you from your Lord so give full measure and full weight and wrong not mankind in their goods and work not confusion in the earth after the fair ordering thereof
That will be better for you if ye are believers
Lurk not on every road to threaten wayfarers and to turn away from Allah s path him who believeth in Him and to seek to make it crooked
And remember when ye were but few how He did multiply you
And see the nature of the consequence for the corrupters
And if there is a party of you which believeth in that wherewith I have been sent and there is a party which believeth not then have patience until Allah judge between us
He is the Best of all who deal in judgment
The chieftains of his people who were scornful said Surely we will drive thee out O Shu eyb and those who believe with thee from our township unless ye return to our religion
He said Even though we hate it
We should have invented a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah hath rescued us from it
It is not for us to return to it unless Allah our Lord should so will
Our Lord comprehendeth all things in knowledge
In Allah do we put our trust
Our Lord
Decide with truth between us and our folk for Thou art the best of those who make decision
But the chieftains of his people who were disbelieving said If ye follow Shu eyb then truly ye shall be the losers
So the earthquake seized them and morning found them prostrate in their dwellingplace
Those who denied Shu eyb became as though they had not dwelt there
Those who denied Shu eyb they were the losers
So he turned from them and said O my people
I delivered my Lord s messages unto you and gave you good advice then how can I sorrow for a people that rejected truth
And We sent no prophet unto any township but We did afflict its folk with tribulation and adversity that haply they might grow humble
Then changed We the evil plight for good till they grew affluent and said Tribulation and distress did touch our fathers
Then We seized them unawares when they perceived not
And if the people of the townships had believed and kept from evil surely We should have opened for them blessings from the sky and from the earth
But unto every messenger they gave the lie and so We seized them on account of what they used to earn
Are the people of the townships then secure from the coming of Our wrath upon them as a nightraid while they sleep
Or are the people of the townships then secure from the coming of Our wrath upon them in the daytime while they play
Are they then secure from Allah s scheme
None deemeth himself secure from Allah s scheme save folk that perish
Is it not an indication to those who inherit the land after its people who thus reaped the consequence of evildoing that if We will We can smite them for their sins and print upon their hearts so that they hear not
Such were the townships We relate some tidings of them unto thee Muhammad
Their messengers verily came unto them with clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty but they could not believe because they had before denied
Thus doth Allah print upon the hearts of disbelievers that they hear not
We found no loyalty to any covenant in most of them
Nay most of them We found wrongdoers
Then after them We sent Moses with our tokens unto Pharaoh and his chiefs but they repelled them
Now see the nature of the consequence for the corrupters
Moses said O Pharaoh
Lo I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds
Approved upon condition that I speak concerning Allah nothing but the truth
I come unto you lords of Egypt with a clear proof from your Lord
So let the Children of Israel go with me
Pharaoh said If thou comest with a token then produce it if thou art of those who speak the truth
Then he flung down his staff and lo it was a serpent manifest
And he drew forth his hand from his bosom and lo it was white for the beholders
The chiefs of Pharaoh s people said Lo this is some knowing wizard
Who would expel you from your land
Now what do ye advise
They said unto Pharaoh Put him off a while him and his brother and send into the cities summoners
To bring each knowing wizard unto thee
And the wizards came to Pharaoh saying Surely there will be a reward for us if we are victors
He answered Yes and surely ye shall be of those brought near to me
They said O Moses
Either throw first or let us be the first throwers
He said Throw
And when they threw they cast a spell upon the people s eyes and overawed them and produced a mighty spell
And We inspired Moses saying Throw thy staff
And lo it swallowed up their lying show
Thus was the Truth vindicated and that which they were doing was made vain
Thus were they there defeated and brought low
And the wizards fell down prostrate
Crying We believe in the Lord of the Worlds
The Lord of Moses and Aaron
Pharaoh said Ye believe in Him before I give you leave
Lo this is the plot that ye have plotted in the city that ye may drive its people hence
But ye shall come to know
Surely I shall have your hands and feet cut off upon alternate sides Then I shall crucify you every one
They said Lo We are about to return unto our Lord
Thou takest vengeance on us only forasmuch as we believed the tokens of our Lord when they came unto us
Our Lord
Vouchsafe unto us steadfastness and make us die as men who have surrendered unto Thee
The chiefs of Pharaoh s people said O King wilt thou suffer Moses and his people to make mischief in the land and flout thee and thy gods
He said We will slay their sons and spare their women for lo we are in power over them
And Moses said unto his people Seek help in Allah and endure
Lo the earth is Allah s
He giveth it for an inheritance to whom He will
And lo the sequel is for those who keep their duty unto Him
They said We suffered hurt before thou camest unto us and since thou hast come unto us
He said It may be that your Lord is going to destroy your adversary and make you viceroys in the earth that He may see how ye behave
And we straitened Pharaoh s folk with famine and dearth of fruits that peradventure they might heed
But whenever good befell them they said This is ours and whenever evil smote them they ascribed it to the evil auspices of Moses and those with him
Surely their evil auspice was only with Allah But most of them knew not
And they said Whatever portent thou bringest wherewith to bewitch us we shall not put faith in thee
So We sent against them the flood and the locusts and the vermin and the frogs and the blood a succession of clear signs
But they were arrogant and became a guilty folk
And when the terror fell on them they cried O Moses
Pray for us unto thy Lord because He hath a covenant with thee
If thou removest the terror from us we verily will trust thee and will let the Children of Israel go with thee
But when We did remove from them the terror for a term which they must reach behold they broke their covenant
Therefore We took retribution from them therefore We drowned them in the sea because they denied Our revelations and were heedless of them
And We caused the folk who were despised to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed
And the fair word of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their endurance and We annihilated all that Pharaoh and his folk had done and that they had contrived
And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came unto a people who were given up to idols which they had
They said O Moses
Make for us a god even as they have gods
He said Lo ye are a folk who know not
Lo as for these their way will be destroyed and all that they are doing is in vain
He said Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah when He hath favoured you above all creatures
And remember when We did deliver you from Pharaoh s folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment slaughtering your sons and sparing your women
That was a tremendous trial from your Lord
And when We did appoint for Moses thirty nights of solitude and added to them ten and he completed the whole time appointed by his Lord of forty nights and Moses said unto his brother Aaron Take my place among the people
Do right and follow not the way of mischiefmakers
And when Moses came to Our appointed tryst and his Lord had spoken unto him he said My Lord
Show me Thy Self that I may gaze upon Thee
He said Thou wilt not see Me but gaze upon the mountain
If it stand still in its place then thou wilt see Me
And when his Lord revealed His glory to the mountain He sent it crashing down
And Moses fell down senseless
And when he woke he said Glory unto Thee
I turn unto Thee repentant and I am the first of true believers
He said O Moses
I have preferred thee above mankind by My messages and by My speaking unto thee
So hold that which I have given thee and be among the thankful
And We wrote for him upon the tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation of all things then bade him Hold it fast and command thy people saying Take the better course made clear therein
I shall show thee the abode of evillivers
I shall turn away from My revelations those who magnify themselves wrongfully in the earth and if they see each token believe it not and if they see the way of righteousness choose it nor for their way and if they see the way of error choose if for their way
That is because they deny Our revelations and are used to disregard them
Those who deny Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter their works are fruitless
Are they requited aught save what they used to do
And the folk of Moses after he left them chose a calf for worship made out of their ornaments of saffron hue which gave a lowing sound
Saw they not that it spake not unto them nor guided them to any way
They chose it and became wrongdoers
And when they feared the consequences thereof and saw that they had gone astray they said Unless our Lord have mercy on us and forgive us we verily are of the lost
And when Moses returned unto his people angry and grieved he said Evil is that course which ye took after I had left you
Would ye hasten on the judgment of your Lord
And he cast down the tablets and he seized his brother by the head dragging him toward him
He said Son of my mother
Lo the folk did judge me weak and almost killed me
Oh make not mine enemies to triumph over me and place me not among the evildoers
He said My Lord
Have mercy on me and on my brother bring us into Thy mercy Thou the Most Merciful of all who show mercy
Lo Those who chose the calf for worship terror from their Lord and humiliation will come upon them in the life of the world
Thus do We requite those who invent a lie
But those who do illdeeds and afterward repent and believe lo for them afterward Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Then when the anger of Moses abated he took up the tablets and in their inscription there was guidance and mercy for all those who fear their Lord
And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointed tryst and when the trembling came on them he said My Lord
If Thou hadst willed Thou hadst destroyed them long before and me with them
Wilt thou destroy us for that which the ignorant among us did
It is but Thy trial of us
Thou sendest whom Thou wilt astray and guidest whom Thou wilt Thou art our Protecting Friend therefore forgive us and have mercy on us Thou the Best of all who show forgiveness
And ordain for us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good Lo
We have turned unto Thee
He said I smite with My punishment whom I will and My mercy embraceth all things therefore I shall ordain it for those who ward off evil and pay the poordue and those who believe Our revelations
Those who follow the messenger the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they will find described in the Torah and the Gospel which are with them
He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to wear
Then those who believe in him and honour him and help him and follow the light which is sent down with him they are the successful
Say O Muhammad O mankind
Lo I am the messenger of Allah to you all the messenger of Him unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
There is no Allah save Him
He quickeneth and He giveth death So believe in Allah and His messenger the Prophet who can neither read nor write who believeth in Allah and in His Words and follow him that haply ye may be led aright
And of Moses folk there is a community who lead with truth and establish justice therewith
We divided them into twelve tribes nations and We inspired Moses when his people asked him for water saying Smite with thy staff the rock
And there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs so that each tribe knew their drinkingplace
And we caused the white cloud to overshadow them and sent down for them the manna and the quails saying Eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you
They wronged Us not but they were wont to wrong themselves
And when it was said unto them Dwell in this township and eat therefrom whence ye will and say Repentance and enter the gate prostrate We shall forgive you your sins We shall increase reward for the rightdoers
But those of them who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for another saying and We sent down upon them wrath from heaven for their wrongdoing
Ask them O Muhammad of the township that was by the sea how they did break the Sabbath how their big fish came unto them visibly upon their Sabbath day and on a day when they did not keep Sabbath came they not unto them
Thus did We try them for that they were evillivers
And when a community among them said Why preach ye to a folk whom Allah is about to destroy or punish with an awful doom they said In order to be free from guilt before your Lord and that haply they may ward off evil
And when they forgot that whereof they had been reminded We rescued those who forbade wrong and visited those who did wrong with dreadful punishment because they were evillivers
So when they took pride in that which they had been forbidden We said unto them Be ye apes despised and loathed
And remember when thy Lord proclaimed that He would raise against them till the Day of Resurrection those who would lay on them a cruel torment
Lo verily thy Lord is swift in prosecution and lo verily He is Forgiving Merciful
And We have sundered them in the earth as separate nations
Some of them are righteous and some far from that
And We have tried them with good things and evil things that haply they might return
And a generation hath succeeded them who inherited the scriptures
They grasp the goods of this low life as the price of evildoing and say It will be forgiven us
And if there came to them again the offer of the like they would accept it and would sin again
Hath not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning Allah save the truth
And they have studied that which is therein
And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who ward off evil
Have ye then no sense
And as for those who make men keep the Scripture and establish worship lo We squander not the wages of reformers
And when We shook the Mount above them as it were a covering and they supposed that it was going to fall upon them and We said Hold fast that which We have given you and remember that which is therein that ye may ward off evil
And remember when thy Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam from their reins their seed and made them testify of themselves saying Am I not your Lord
They said Yea verily We testify
That was lest ye should say at the Day of Resurrection Lo of this we were unaware
Or lest ye should say It is only that our fathers ascribed partners to Allah of old and we were their seed after them
Wilt Thou destroy us on account of that which those who follow falsehood did
Thus we detail the revelations that haply they may return
Recite unto them the tale of him to whom We gave Our revelations but he sloughed them off so Satan overtook him and he became of those who lead astray
And had We willed We could have raised him by their means but he clung to the earth and followed his own lust
Therefor his likeness is as the likeness of a dog if thou attackest him he panteth with his tongue out and if thou leavest him he panteth with his tongue out
Such is the likeness of the people who deny Our revelations
Narrate unto them the history of the men of old that haply they may take thought
Evil as an example are the folk who denied Our revelations and were wont to wrong themselves
He whom Allah leadeth he indeed is led aright while he whom Allah sendeth astray they indeed are losers
Already have We urged unto hell many of the jinn and humankind having hearts wherewith they understand not and having eyes wherewith they see not and having ears wherewith they hear not
These are as the cattle nay but they are worse
These are the neglectful
Allah s are the fairest names
Invoke Him by them And leave the company of those who blaspheme His names
They will be requited what they do
And of those whom We created there is a nation who guide with the Truth and establish justice therewith
And those who deny Our revelations step by step We lead them on from whence they know not
I give them rein for lo
My scheme is strong
Have they not bethought them that there is no madness in their comrade
He is but a plain warner
Have they not considered the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what things Allah hath created and that it may be that their own term draweth nigh
In what fact after this will they believe
Those whom Allah sendeth astray there is no guide for them
He leaveth them to wander blindly on in their contumacy
They ask thee of the destined Hour when will it come to port
Say Knowledge thereof is with my Lord only
He alone will manifest it at its proper time
It is heavy in the heavens and the earth
It cometh not to you save unawares
They question thee as if thou couldst be well informed thereof
Say Knowledge thereof is with Allah only but most of mankind know not
Say For myself I have no power to benefit nor power to hurt save that which Allah willeth
Had I knowledge of the Unseen I should have abundance of wealth and adversity would not touch me
I am but a warner and a bearer of good tidings unto folk who believe
He it is Who did create you from a single soul and therefrom did make his mate that he might take rest in her
And when he covered her she bore a light burden and she passed unnoticed with it but when it became heavy they cried unto Allah their Lord saying If thou givest unto us aright we shall be of the thankful
But when He gave unto them aright they ascribed unto Him partners in respect of that which He had given them
High is He Exalted above all that they associate with Him
Attribute they as partners to Allah those who created naught but are themselves created
And cannot give them help nor can they help themselves
And if ye call them to the Guidance they follow you not
Whether ye call them or are silent is all one for you
Lo those on whom ye call beside Allah are slaves like unto you
Call on them now and let them answer you if ye are truthful
Have they feet wherewith they walk or have they hands wherewith they hold or have they eyes wherewith they see or have they ears wherewith they hear Say Call upon your socalled partners of Allah and then contrive against me spare me not
Lo my Protecting Friend is Allah Who revealeth the Scripture
He befriendeth the righteous
They on whom ye call beside Him have no power to help you nor can they help you nor can they help themselves
And if ye Muslims call them to the guidance they hear not and thou Muhammad seest them looking toward thee but they see not
Keep to forgiveness O Muhammad and enjoin kindness and turn away from the ignorant
And if a slander from the devil wound thee then seek refuge in Allah
Lo He is Hearer Knower
Lo those who ward off evil when a glamour from the devil troubleth them they do but remember Allah s Guidance and behold them seers
Their brethren plunge them further into error and cease not
And when thou bringest not a verse for them they say Why hast thou not chosen it
Say I follow only that which is inspired in me from my Lord
This Qur an is insight from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy for a people that believe
And when the Qur an is recited give ear to it and pay heed that ye may obtain mercy
And do thou O Muhammad remember thy Lord within thyself humbly and with awe below thy breath at morn and evening And be not thou of the neglectful
Lo those who are with thy Lord are not too proud to do Him service but they praise Him and prostrate before Him
They ask thee O Muhammad of the spoils of war
Say The spoils of war belong to Allah and the messenger so keep your duty to Allah and adjust the matter of your difference and obey Allah and His messenger if ye are true believers
They only are the true believers whose hearts feel fear when Allah is mentioned and when His revelations are recited unto them they increase their faith and who trust in their Lord
Who establish worship and spend of that We have bestowed on them
Those are they who are in truth believers
For them are grades of honour with their Lord and pardon and a bountiful provision
Even as thy Lord caused thee Muhammad to go forth from thy home with the Truth and lo a party of the believers were averse to it
Disputing with thee of the Truth after it had been made manifest as if they were being driven to death visible
And when Allah promised you one of the two bands of the enemy that it should be yours and ye longed that other than the armed one might be yours
And Allah willed that He should cause the Truth to triumph by His words and cut the root of the disbelievers
That He might cause the Truth to triumph and bring vanity to naught however much the guilty might oppose
When ye sought help of your Lord and He answered you saying I will help you with a thousand of the angels rank on rank
Allah appointed it only as good tidings and that your hearts thereby might be at rest
Victory cometh only by the help of Allah
Lo Allah is Mighty Wise
When He made the slumber fall upon you as a reassurance from him and sent down water from the sky upon you that thereby He might purify you and remove from you the fear of Satan and make strong your hearts and firm your feet thereby
When thy Lord inspired the angels saying I am with you
So make those who believe stand firm
I will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve
Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger
That is because they opposed Allah and His messenger
Whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger for him lo Allah is severe in punishment
That is the award so taste it and know that for disbelievers is the torment of the Fire
O ye who believe
When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle turn not your backs to them
Whoso on that day turneth his back to them unless manoeuvring for battle or intent to join a company he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah and his habitation will be hell a hapless journey s end
Ye Muslims slew them not but Allah slew them
And thou Muhammad threwest not when thou didst throw but Allah threw that He might test the believers by a fair test from Him
Lo Allah is Hearer Knower
That is the case and know that Allah it is Who maketh weak the plan of disbelievers
O Qureysh If ye sought a judgment now hath the judgment come unto you
And if ye cease from persecuting the believers it will be better for you but if ye return to the attack We also shall return
And your host will avail you naught however numerous it be and know that Allah is with the believers in His Guidance
O ye who believe
Obey Allah and His messenger and turn not away from him when ye hear him speak
Be not as those who say we hear and they hear not
Lo the worst of beasts in Allah s sight are the deaf the dumb who have no sense
Had Allah known of any good in them He would have made them hear but had He made them hear they would have turned away averse
O ye who believe
Obey Allah and the messenger when He calleth you to that which quickeneth you and know that Allah cometh in between the man and his own heart and that He it is unto Whom ye will be gathered
And guard yourselves against a chastisement which cannot fall exclusively on those of you who are wrongdoers and know that Allah is severe in punishment
And remember when ye were few and reckoned feeble in the land and were in fear lest men should extirpate you how He gave you refuge and strengthened you with His help and made provision of good things for you that haply ye might be thankful
O ye who believe
Betray not Allah and His messenger nor knowingly betray your trusts
And know that your possessions and your children are a test and that with Allah is immense reward
O ye who believe
If ye keep your duty to Allah He will give you discrimination between right and wrong and will rid you of your evil thoughts and deeds and will forgive you
Allah is of Infinite Bounty
And when those who disbelieve plot against thee O Muhammad to wound thee fatally or to kill thee or to drive thee forth they plot but Allah also plotteth and Allah is the best of plotters
And when Our revelations are recited unto them they say We have heard
If we wish we can speak the like of this
Lo this is naught but fables of the men of old
And when they said O Allah
If this be indeed the truth from Thee then rain down stones on us or bring on us some painful doom
But Allah would not punish them while thou wast with them nor will He punish them while they seek forgiveness
What plea have they that Allah should not punish them when they debar His servants from the Inviolable Place of Worship though they are not its fitting guardians
Its fitting guardians are those only who keep their duty to Allah
But most of them know not
And their worship at the holy House is naught but whistling and handclapping
Therefore it is said unto them Taste of the doom because ye disbelieve
Lo those who disbelieve spend their wealth in order that they may debar men from the way of Allah
They will spend it then it will become an anguish for them then they will be conquered
And those who disbelieve will be gathered unto hell
That Allah may separate the wicked from the good The wicked will He place piece upon piece and heap them all together and consign them unto hell
Such verily are the losers
Tell those who disbelieve that if they cease from persecution of believers that which is past will be forgiven them but if they return thereto then the example of the men of old hath already gone before them for a warning
And fight them until persecution is no more and religion is all for Allah
But if they cease then lo Allah is Seer of what they do
And if they turn away then know that Allah is your Befriender a Transcendent Patron a Transcendent Helper
And know that whatever ye take as spoils of war lo a fifth thereof is for Allah and for the messenger and for the kinsman who hath need and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer if ye believe in Allah and that which We revealed unto Our slave on the Day of Discrimination the day when the two armies met
And Allah is Able to do all things
When ye were on the near bank of the valley and they were on the yonder bank and the caravan was below you on the coast plain
And had ye trysted to meet one another ye surely would have failed to keep the tryst but it happened as it did without the forethought of either of you that Allah might conclude a thing that must be done that he who perished on that day might perish by a clear proof of His Sovereignty and he who survived might survive by a clear proof of His Sovereignty Lo
Allah in truth is Hearer Knower
When Allah showed them unto thee O Muhammad in thy dream as few in number and if He had shown them to thee as many ye Muslims would have faltered and would have quarrelled over the affair
But Allah saved you Lo
He knoweth what is in the breasts of men
And when He made you Muslims when ye met them see them with your eyes as few and lessened you in their eyes it was that Allah might conclude a thing that must be done
Unto Allah all things are brought back
O ye who believe
When ye meet an army hold firm and think of Allah much that ye may be successful
And obey Allah and His messenger and dispute not one with another lest ye falter and your strength depart from you but be steadfast
Lo Allah is with the steadfast
Be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully and to be seen of men and debar men from the way of Allah while Allah is surrounding all they do
And when Satan made their deeds seem fair to them and said Noone of mankind can conquer you this day for I am your protector
But when the armies came in sight of one another he took flight saying Lo I am guiltless of you
Lo I see that which ye see not
Lo I fear Allah
And Allah is severe in punishment
When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said Their religion hath deluded these
Whoso putteth his trust in Allah will find that lo Allah is Mighty Wise
If thou couldst see how the angels receive those who disbelieve smiting faces and their backs and saying Taste the punishment of burning
This is for that which your own hands have sent before to the Judgment and know that Allah is not a tyrant to His slaves
Their way is as the way of Pharaoh s folk and those before them they disbelieved the revelations of Allah and Allah took them in their sins Lo
Allah is Strong severe in punishment
That is because Allah never changeth the grace He hath bestowed on any people until they first change that which is in their hearts and that is because Allah is Hearer Knower
Their way is as the way of Pharaoh s folk and those before them they denied the revelations of their Lord so We destroyed them in their sins
And We drowned the folk of Pharaoh
All were evildoers
Lo the worst of beasts in Allah s sight are the ungrateful who will not believe
Those of them with whom thou madest a treaty and then at every opportunity they break their treaty and they keep not duty to Allah
If thou comest on them in the war deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them that haply they may remember
And if thou fearest treachery from any folk then throw back to them their treaty fairly Lo
Allah loveth not the treacherous
And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip Allah s Purpose
Lo they cannot escape
Make ready for them all thou canst of armed force and of horses tethered that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others beside them whom ye know not Allah knoweth them
Whatsoever ye spend in the way of Allah it will be repaid to you in full and ye will not be wronged
And if they incline to peace incline thou also to it and trust in Allah Lo
He even He is the Hearer the Knower
And if they would deceive thee then lo Allah is Sufficient for thee
He it is Who supporteth thee with His help and with the believers
And as for the believers hath attuned their hearts
If thou hadst spent all that is in the earth thou couldst not have attuned their hearts but Allah hath attuned them Lo
He is Mighty Wise
O Prophet
Allah is Sufficient for thee and those who follow thee of the believers
O Prophet
Exhort the believers to fight
If there be of you twenty steadfast they shall overcome two hundred and if there be of you a hundred steadfast they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve because they the disbelievers are a folk without intelligence
Now hath Allah lightened your burden for He knoweth that there is weakness in you
So if there be of you a steadfast hundred they shall overcome two hundred and if there be of you a thousand steadfast they shall overcome two thousand by permission of Allah
Allah is with the steadfast
It is not for any prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land
Ye desire the lure of this world and Allah desireth for you the Hereafter and Allah is Mighty Wise
Had it not been for an ordinance of Allah which had gone before an awful doom had come upon you on account of what ye took
Now enjoy what ye have won as lawful and good and keep your duty to Allah
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O Prophet
Say unto those captives who are in your hands If Allah knoweth any good in your hearts He will give you better than that which hath been taken from you and will forgive you
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And if they would betray thee they betrayed Allah before and He gave thee power over them
Allah is Knower Wise
Lo those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah and those who took them in and helped them these are protecting friends one of another
And those who believed but did not leave their homes ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to help them except against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty
Allah is Seer of what ye do
And those who disbelieve are protectors one of another If ye do not so there will be confusion in the land and great corruption
Those who believed and left their homes and strove for the cause of Allah and those who took them in and helped them these are the believers in truth
For them is pardon and bountiful provision
And those who afterwards believed and left their homes and strove along with you they are of you and those who are akin are nearer one to another in the ordinance of Allah Lo
Allah is Knower of all things
Freedom from obligation is proclaimed from Allah and His messenger toward those of the idolaters with whom ye made a treaty
Travel freely in the land four months and know that ye cannot escape Allah and that Allah will confound the disbelievers in His Guidance
And a proclamation from Allah and His messenger to all men on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage that Allah is free from obligation to the idolaters and so is His messenger
So if ye repent it will be better for you but if ye are averse then know that ye cannot escape Allah
Give tidings O Muhammad of a painful doom to those who disbelieve
Excepting those of the idolaters with whom ye Muslims have a treaty and who have since abated nothing of your right nor have supported anyone against you
As for these fulfil their treaty to them till their term Lo
Allah loveth those who keep their duty unto Him
Then when the sacred months have passed slay the idolaters wherever ye find them and take them captive and besiege them and prepare for them each ambush
But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poordue then leave their way free
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And if anyone of the idolaters seeketh thy protection O Muhammad then protect him so that he may hear the Word of Allah and afterward convey him to his place of safety
That is because they are a folk who know not
How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His messenger for the idolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship
So long as they are true to you be true to them Lo
Allah loveth those who keep their duty
How can there be any treaty for the others when if they have the upper hand of you they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you
They satisfy you with their mouths the while their hearts refuse
And most of them are wrongdoers
They have purchased with the revelations of Allah a little gain so they debar men from His way
Lo evil is that which they are wont to do
And they observe toward a believer neither pact nor honour
These are they who are transgressors
But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poordue then are they your brethren in religion
We detail Our revelations for a people who have knowledge
And if they break their pledges after their treaty hath been made with you and assail your religion then fight the heads of disbelief Lo they have no binding oaths in order that they may desist
Will ye not fight a folk who broke their solemn pledges and purposed to drive out the messenger and did attack you first
What Fear ye them
Now Allah hath more right that ye should fear Him if ye are believers
Fight them Allah will chastise them at your hands and He will lay them low and give you victory over them and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers
And He will remove the anger of their hearts
Allah relenteth toward whom He will
Allah is Knower Wise
Or deemed ye that ye would be left in peace when Allah yet knoweth not those of you who strive choosing for familiar none save Allah and His messenger and the believers
Allah is Informed of what ye do
It is not for the idolaters to tend Allah s sanctuaries bearing witness against themselves of disbelief
As for such their works are vain and in the Fire they will abide
He only shall tend Allah s sanctuaries who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and observeth proper worship and payeth the poordue and feareth none save Allah
For such only is it possible that they can be of the rightly guided
Count ye the slaking of a pilgrim s thirst and tendance of the Inviolable Place of Worship as equal to the worth of him who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and striveth in the way of Allah
They are not equal in the sight of Allah
Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
Those who believe and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah s way are of much greater worth in Allah s sight
These are they who are triumphant
Their Lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from Him and acceptance and Gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs
There they will abide for ever
Lo with Allah there is immense reward
O ye who believe
Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith
Whoso of you taketh them for friends such are wrongdoers
Say If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your wives and your tribe and the wealth ye have acquired and merchandise for which ye fear that there will no sale and dwellings ye desire are dearer to you than Allah and His messenger and striving in His way then wait till Allah bringeth His command to pass
Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
Allah hath given you victory on many fields and on the day of Huneyn when ye exulted in your multitude but it availed you naught and the earth vast as it is was straitened for you then ye turned back in flight
Then Allah sent His peace of reassurance down upon His messenger and upon the believers and sent down hosts ye could not see and punished those who disbelieved
Such is the reward of disbelievers
Then afterward Allah will relent toward whom He will for Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O ye who believe
The idolaters only are unclean
So let them not come near the Inviolable Place of Worship after this their year
If ye fear poverty from the loss of their merchandise Allah shall preserve you of His bounty if He will
Lo Allah is Knower Wise
Fight against such of those who have been given the Scripture as believe not in Allah nor the Last Day and forbid not that which Allah hath forbidden by His messenger and follow not the Religion of Truth until they pay the tribute readily being brought low
And the Jews say Ezra is the son of Allah and the Christians say The Messiah is the son of Allah
That is their saying with their mouths
They imitate the saying of those who disbelieved of old
Allah Himself fighteth against them
How perverse are they
They have taken as lords beside Allah their rabbis and their monks and the Messiah son of Mary when they were bidden to worship only One Allah
There is no Allah save Him
Be He Glorified from all that they ascribe as partner unto Him
Fain would they put out the light of Allah with their mouths but Allah disdaineth aught save that He shall perfect His light however much the disbelievers are averse
He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth that He may cause it to prevail over all religion however much the idolaters may be averse
O ye who believe
Lo many of the Jewish rabbis and the Christian monks devour the wealth of mankind wantonly and debar men from the way of Allah
They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah unto them give tidings O Muhammad of a painful doom
On the day when it will all be heated in the fire of hell and their foreheads and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith and it will be said unto them Here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves
Now taste of what ye used to hoard
Lo the number of the months with Allah is twelve months by Allah s ordinance in the day that He created the heavens and the earth
Four of them are sacred that is the right religion
So wrong not yourselves in them
And wage war on all of the idolaters as they are waging war on all of you And know that Allah is with those who keep their duty unto Him
Postponement of a sacred month is only an excess of disbelief whereby those who disbelieve are misled they allow it one year and forbid it another year that they may make up the number of the months which Allah hath hallowed so that they allow that which Allah hath forbidden
The evil of their deeds is made fairseeming unto them
Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk
O ye who believe
What aileth you that when it is said unto you Go forth in the way of Allah ye are bowed down to the ground with heaviness
Take ye pleasure in the life of the world rather than in the Hereafter
The comfort of the life of the world is but little in the Hereafter
If ye go not forth He will afflict you with a painful doom and will choose instead of you a folk other than you
Ye cannot harm Him at all Allah is Able to do all things
If ye help him not still Allah helped him when those who disbelieve drove him forth the second of two when they two were in the cave when he said unto his comrade Grieve not Lo
Allah is with us Then Allah caused His peace of reassurance to descend upon him and supported him with hosts ye cannot see and made the word of those who disbelieved the nethermost while Allah s Word it was that became the uppermost
Allah is Mighty Wise
Go forth lightarmed and heavyarmed and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah
That is best for you if ye but knew
Had it been a near adventure and an easy journey they had followed thee but the distance seemed too far for them
Yet will they swear by Allah saying If we had been able we would surely have set out with you
They destroy their souls and Allah knoweth that they verily are liars
Allah forgive thee O Muhammad
Wherefor didst thou grant them leave ere those who told the truth were manifest to thee and thou didst know the liars
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask no leave of thee lest they should strive with their wealth and their lives
Allah is Aware of those who keep their duty unto Him
They alone ask leave of thee who believe not in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts feel doubt so in their doubt they waver
And if they had wished to go forth they would assuredly have made ready some equipment but Allah was averse to their being sent forth and held them back and it was said unto them Sit ye with the sedentary
Had they gone forth among you they had added to you naught save trouble and had hurried to and fro among you seeking to cause sedition among you and among you there are some who would have listened to them
Allah is Aware of evildoers
Aforetime they sought to cause sedition and raised difficulties for thee till the Truth came and the decree of Allah was made manifest though they were loth
Of them is he who saith Grant me leave to stay at home and tempt me not
Surely it is into temptation that they thus have fallen
Lo hell verily is all around the disbelievers
If good befalleth thee O Muhammad it afflicteth them and if calamity befalleth thee they say We took precaution and they turn away well pleased
Say Naught befalleth us save that which Allah hath decreed for us
He is our Protecting Friend
In Allah let believers put their trust
Say Can ye await for us aught save one of two good things death or victory in Allah s way while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with a doom from Him or at our hands Await then
Lo We are awaiting with you
Say Pay your contribution willingly or unwillingly it will not be accepted from you
Lo ye were ever froward folk
And naught preventeth that their contributions should be accepted from them save that they have disbelieved in Allah and in His messenger and they come not to worship save as idlers and pay not their contribution save reluctantly
So let not their riches nor their children please thee O Muhammad
Allah thereby intendeth but to punish them in the life of the world and that their souls shall pass away while they are disbelievers
And they swear by Allah that they are in truth of you when they are not of you but they are folk who are afraid
Had they but found a refuge or caverns or a place to enter they surely had resorted thither swift as runaways
And of them is he who defameth thee in the matter of the alms
If they are given thereof they are content and if they are not given thereof behold they are enraged
How much more seemly had they been content with that which Allah and His messenger had given them and had said Allah sufficeth us
Allah will give us of His bounty and also His messenger
Unto Allah we are suppliants
The alms are only for the poor and the needy and those who collect them and those whose hearts are to be reconciled and to free the captives and the debtors and for the cause of Allah and for the wayfarer a duty imposed by Allah
Allah is Knower Wise
And of them are those who vex the Prophet and say He is only a hearer
Say A hearer of good for you who believeth in Allah and is true to the believers and a mercy for such of you as believe
Those who vex the messenger of Allah for them there is a painful doom
They swear by Allah to you Muslims to please you but Allah with His messenger hath more right that they should please Him if they are believers
Know they not that whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger his verily is fire of hell to abide therein
That is the extreme abasement
The hypocrites fear lest a surah should be revealed concerning them proclaiming what is in their hearts
Say Scoff your fill
Lo Allah is disclosing what ye fear
And if thou ask them O Muhammad they will say We did but talk and jest
Say Was it at Allah and His revelations and His messenger that ye did scoff
Make no excuse
Ye have disbelieved after your confession of belief
If We forgive a party of you a party of you We shall punish because they have been guilty
The hypocrites both men and women proceed one from another
They enjoin the wrong and they forbid the right and they withhold their hands from spending for the cause of Allah
They forget Allah so He hath forgotten them
Lo the hypocrites they are the transgressors
Allah promiseth the hypocrites both men and women and the disbelievers fire of hell for their abode
It will suffice them
Allah curseth them and theirs is lasting torment
Even as those before you who were mightier than you in strength and more affluent than you in wealth and children
They enjoyed their lot awhile so ye enjoy your lot awhile even as those before you did enjoy their lot awhile
And ye prate even as they prated
Such are they whose works have perished in the world and the Hereafter
Such are they who are the losers
Hath not the fame of those before them reached them the folk of Noah A ad Thamud the folk of Abraham the dwellers of Midian and the disasters which befell them
Their messengers from Allah came unto them with proofs of Allah s Sovereignty
So Allah surely wronged them not but they did wrong themselves
And the believers men and women are protecting friends one of another they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong and they establish worship and they pay the poordue and they obey Allah and His messenger
As for these Allah will have mercy on them
Lo Allah is Mighty Wise
Allah promiseth to the believers men and women Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide blessed dwellings in Gardens of Eden
And greater far acceptance from Allah
That is the supreme triumph
O Prophet
Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites
Be harsh with them
Their ultimate abode is hell a hapless journey s end
They swear by Allah that they said nothing wrong yet they did say the word of disbelief and did disbelieve after their Surrender to Allah
And they purposed that which they could not attain and they sought revenge only that Allah by His messenger should enrich them of His bounty
If they repent it will be better for them and if they turn away Allah will afflict them with a painful doom in the world and the Hereafter and they have no protecting friend nor helper in the earth
And of them is he who made a covenant with Allah saying If He give us of His bounty we will give alms and become of the righteous
Yet when He gave them of His bounty they hoarded it and turned away averse
So He hath made the consequence to be hypocrisy in their hearts until the day when they shall meet Him because they broke their word to Allah that they promised Him and because they lied
Know they not that Allah knoweth both their secret and the thought that they confide and that Allah is the Knower of Things Hidden
Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly and such as can find naught to give but their endeavours and deride them Allah Himself derideth them
Theirs will be a painful doom
Ask forgiveness for them O Muhammad or ask not forgiveness for them though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them
That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger and Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
Those who were left behind rejoiced at sitting still behind the messenger of Allah and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in Allah s way And they said Go not forth in the heat
Say The fire of hell is more intense of heat if they but understood
Then let them laugh a little they will weep much as the reward of what they used to earn
If Allah bring thee back from the campaign unto a party of them and they ask of thee leave to go out to fight then say unto them Ye shall never more go out with me nor fight with me against a foe
Ye were content with sitting still the first time
So sit still with the useless
And never O Muhammad pray for one of them who dieth nor stand by his grave
Lo they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger and they died while they were evildoers
Let not their wealth nor their children please thee
Allah purposeth only to punish them thereby in the world and that their souls shall pass away while they are disbelievers
And when a surah is revealed which saith Believe in Allah and strive along with His messenger the men of wealth among them still ask leave of thee and say Suffer us to be with those who sit at home
They are content that they should be with the useless and their hearts are sealed so that they apprehend not
But the messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and their lives
Such are they for whom are the good things
Such are they who are the successful
Allah hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide
That is the supreme triumph
And those among the wandering Arabs who had an excuse came in order that permission might be granted them
And those who lied to Allah and His messenger sat at home
A painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve
Not unto the weak nor unto the sick nor unto those who can find naught to spend is any fault to be imputed though they stay at home if they are true to Allah and His messenger
Not unto the good is there any road of blame
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Nor unto those whom when they came to thee asking that thou shouldst mount them thou didst tell I cannot find whereon to mount you They turned back with eyes flowing with tears for sorrow that they could not find the means to spend
The road of blame is only against those who ask for leave of thee to stay at home when they are rich
They are content to be with the useless
Allah hath sealed their hearts so that they know not
They will make excuse to you Muslims when ye return unto them
Say Make no excuse for we shall not believe you
Allah hath told us tidings of you
Allah and His messenger will see your conduct and then ye will be brought back unto Him Who knoweth the Invisible as well as the Visible and He will tell you what ye used to do
They will swear by Allah unto you when ye return unto them that ye may let them be
Let them be for lo they are unclean and their abode is hell as the reward for what they used to earn
They swear unto you that ye may accept them
Though ye accept them Allah verily accepteth not wrongdoing folk
The wandering Arabs are more hard in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely to be ignorant of the limits which Allah hath revealed unto His messenger
And Allah is Knower Wise
And of the wandering Arabs there is he who taketh that which he expendeth for the cause of Allah as a loss and awaiteth evil turns of fortune for you that he may be rid of it
The evil turn of fortune will be theirs
Allah is Hearer Knower
And of the wandering Arabs there is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and taketh that which he expendeth and also the prayers of the messenger as acceptable offerings in the sight of Allah
Lo verily it is an acceptable offering for them
Allah will bring them into His mercy
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And the first to lead the way of the Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who followed them in goodness Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him and He hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever
That is the supreme triumph
And among those around you of the wandering Arabs there are hypocrites and among the townspeople of AlMadinah there are some who persist in hypocrisy whom thou O Muhammad knowest not We We know them and We shall chastise them twice then they will be relegated to a painful doom
And there are others who have acknowledged their faults
They mixed a righteous action with another that was bad
It may be that Allah will relent toward them
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Take alms of their wealth wherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst make them grow and pray for them
Lo thy prayer is an assuagement for them
Allah is Hearer Knower
Know they not that Allah is He Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen and taketh the alms and that Allah is He Who is the Relenting the Merciful
And say unto them Act
Allah will behold your actions and so will His messenger and the believers and ye will be brought back to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible and He will tell you what ye used to do
And there are others who await Allah s decree whether He will punish them or will forgive them
Allah is Knower Wise
And as for those who chose a place of worship out of opposition and disbelief and in order to cause dissent among the believers and as an outpost for those who warred against Allah and His messenger aforetime they will surely swear We purposed naught save good
Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars
Never stand to pray there
A place of worship which was found upon duty to Allah from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand to pray therein wherein are men who love to purify themselves
Allah loveth the purifiers
Is he who founded his building upon duty to Allah and His good pleasure better or he who founded his building on the brink of a crumbling overhanging precipice so that it toppled with him into the fire of hell
Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
The building which they built will never cease to be a misgiving in their hearts unless their hearts be torn to pieces
Allah is Knower Wise
Lo Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain
It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur an
Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah
Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made for that is the supreme triumph
Triumphant are those who turn repentant to Allah those who serve Him those who praise Him those who fast those who bow down those who fall prostrate in worship those who enjoin the right and who forbid the wrong and those who keep the limits ordained of Allah And give glad tidings to believers
It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to pray for the forgiveness of idolaters even though they may be near of kin to them after it hath become clear that they are people of hellfire
The prayer of Abraham for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise he had promised him but when it had become clear unto him that he his father was an enemy to Allah he Abraham disowned him Lo
Abraham was soft of heart longsuffering
It was never Allah s part that He should send a folk astray after He had guided them until He had made clear unto them what they should avoid
Lo Allah is Aware of all things
Allah Unto Him belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
He quickeneth and He giveth death
And ye have instead of Allah no protecting friend nor helper
Allah hath turned in mercy to the Prophet and to the Muhajirin and the Ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship After the hearts of a party of them had almost swerved aside then turned He unto them in mercy
Lo He is Full of Pity Merciful for them
And to the three also did He turn in mercy who were left behind when the earth vast as it is was straitened for them and their own souls were straitened for them till they bethought them that there is no refuge from Allah save toward Him
Then turned He unto them in mercy that they too might turn repentant unto Him Lo
Allah He is the Relenting the Merciful
O ye who believe
Be careful of your duty to Allah and be with the truthful
It is not for the townsfolk of AlMadinah and for those around them of the wandering Arabs so stay behind the messenger of Allah and prefer their lives to his life
That is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicteth them in the way of Allah nor step they any step that angereth the disbelievers nor gain they from the enemy a gain but a good deed is recorded for them therefor
Lo Allah loseth not the wages of the good
Nor spend they any spending small or great nor do they cross a valley but it is recorded for them that Allah may repay them the best of what they used to do
And the believers should not all go out to fight
Of every troop of them a party only should go forth that they who are left behind may gain sound knowledge in religion and that they may warn their folk when they return to them so that they may beware
O ye who believe
Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you and let them find harshness in you and know that Allah is with those who keep their duty unto Him
And whenever a surah is revealed there are some of them who say Which one of you hath thus increased in faith
As for those who believe it hath increased them in faith and they rejoice therefor
But as for those in whose hearts is disease it only addeth wickedness to their wickedness and they die while they are disbelievers
See they not that they are tested once or twice in every year
Still they turn not in repentance neither pay they heed
And whenever a surah is revealed they look one at another as who should say Doth anybody see you Then they turn away
Allah turneth away their hearts because they are a folk who understand not
There hath come unto you a messenger one of yourselves unto whom aught that ye are overburdened is grievous full of concern for you for the believers full of pity merciful
Now if they turn away O Muhammad say Allah sufficeth me
There is no Allah save Him
In Him have I put my trust and He is Lord of the Tremendous Throne
Alif
Lam
Ra
These are verses of the Wise Scripture
Is it a wonder for mankind that We have inspired a man among them saying Warn mankind and bring unto those who believe the good tidings that they have a sure footing with their Lord
The disbelievers say Lo this is a mere wizard
Lo your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days then He established Himself upon the Throne directing all things
There is no intercessor with Him save after His permission
That is Allah your Lord so worship Him
Oh will ye not remind
Unto Him is the return of all of you it is a promise of Allah in truth
Lo He produceth creation then reproduceth it that He may reward those who believe and do good works with equity while as for those who disbelieve theirs will be a boiling drink and painful doom because they disbelieved
He it is Who appointed the sun a splendour and the moon a light and measured for her stages that ye might know the number of the years and the reckoning
Allah created not all that save in truth
He detaileth the revelations for people who have knowledge
Lo in the difference of day and night and all that Allah hath created in the heavens and the earth are portents verily for folk who ward off evil
Lo those who expect not the meeting with Us but desire the life of the world and feel secure therein and those who are neglectful of Our revelations
Their home will be the Fire because of what they used to earn
Lo those who believe and do good works their Lord guideth them by their faith
Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Delight
Their prayer therein will be Glory be to Thee O Allah and their greeting therein will be Peace And the conclusion of their prayer will be Praise be to Allah Lord of the Worlds
If Allah were to hasten on for men the ill that they have earned as they would hasten on the good their respite would already have expired
But We suffer those who look not for the meeting with Us to wander blindly on in their contumacy
And if misfortune touch a man he crieth unto Us while reclining on his side or sitting or standing but when We have relieved him of the misfortune he goeth his way as though he had not cried unto Us because of a misfortune that afflicted him
Thus is what they do made seeming fair unto the prodigal
We destroyed the generations before you when they did wrong and their messengers from Allah came unto them with clear proofs of His Sovereignty but they would not believe
Thus do We reward the guilty folk
Then We appointed you viceroys in the earth after them that We might see how ye behave
And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them they who look not for the meeting with Us say Bring a Lecture other than this or change it
Say O Muhammad It is not for me to change it of my accord
I only follow that which is inspired in me
Lo if I disobey my Lord I fear the retribution of an awful Day
Say If Allah had so willed I should not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you
I dwelt among you a whole lifetime before it came to me
Have ye then no sense
Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah and denieth His revelations
Lo the guilty never are successful
They worship beside Allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth them and they say These are our intercessors with Allah
Say Would ye inform Allah of something that He knoweth not in the heavens or in the earth
Praised be He and High Exalted above all that ye associate with Him
Mankind were but one community then they differed and had it not been for a word that had already gone forth from thy Lord it had been judged between them in respect of that wherein they differ
And they will say If only a portent were sent down upon him from his Lord
Then say O Muhammad The Unseen belongeth to Allah So wait
Lo I am waiting with you
And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy after some adversity which had afflicted them behold they have some plot against Our revelations
Say Allah is more swift in plotting
Lo Our messengers write down that which ye plot
He it is Who maketh you to go on the land and the sea till when ye are in the ships and they sail with them with a fair breeze and they are glad therein a stormwind reacheth them and the wave cometh unto them from every side and they deem that they are overwhelmed therein then they cry unto Allah making their faith pure for Him only If Thou deliver us from this we truly will be of the thankful
Yet when He hath delivered them behold they rebel in the earth wrongfully
O mankind
Your rebellion is only against yourselves
Ye have enjoyment of the life of the world then unto Us is your return and We shall proclaim unto you what ye used to do
The similitude of the life of the world is only as water which We send down from the sky then the earth s growth of that which men and cattle eat mingleth with it till when the earth hath taken on her ornaments and is embellished and her people deem that they are masters of her Our commandment cometh by night or by day and We make it as reaped corn as if it had not flourished yesterday
Thus do we expound the revelations for people who reflect
And Allah summoneth to the abode of peace and leadeth whom He will to a straight path
For those who do good is the best reward and more thereto
Neither dust nor ignominy cometh near their faces
Such are rightful owners of the Garden they will abide therein
And those who earn illdeeds for them requital of each illdeed by the like thereof and ignominy overtaketh them They have no protector from Allah as if their faces had been covered with a cloak of darkest night Such are rightful owners of the Fire they will abide therein
On the day when We gather them all together then We say unto those who ascribed partners unto Us Stand back ye and your pretended partners of Allah
And We separate them the one from the other and their pretended partners say It was not us ye worshipped
Allah sufficeth as a witness between us and you that we were unaware of your worship
There doth every soul experience that which it did aforetime and they are returned unto Allah their rightful Lord and that which they used to invent hath failed them
Say unto them O Muhammad Who provideth for you from the sky and the earth or Who owneth hearing and sight and Who bringeth forth the living from the dead and bringeth forth the dead from the living and Who directeth the course
They will say Allah
Then say Will ye not then keep your duty unto Him
Such then is Allah your rightful Lord
After the Truth what is there saving error
How then are ye turned away
Thus is the Word of thy Lord justified concerning those who do wrong that they believe not
Say Is there of your partners whom ye ascribe unto Allah one that produceth Creation and then reproduceth it
Say Allah produceth Creation then reproduceth it
How then are ye misled
Say Is there of your partners whom ye ascribe unto Allah one that leadeth to the Truth
Say Allah leadeth to the Truth
Is He Who leadeth to the Truth more deserving that He should be followed or he who findeth not the way unless he himself be guided
What aileth you
How judge ye
Most of them follow not but conjecture
Assuredly conjecture can by no means take the place of truth
Lo Allah is Aware of what they do
And this Qur an is not such as could ever be invented in despite of Allah but it is a confirmation of that which was before it and an exposition of that which is decreed for mankind Therein is no doubt from the Lord of the Worlds
Or say they He hath invented it
Say Then bring a surah like unto it and call for help on all ye can besides Allah if ye are truthful
Nay but they denied that the knowledge whereof they could not compass and whereof the interpretation in events hath not yet come unto them
Even so did those before them deny
Then see what was the consequence for the wrongdoers
And of them is he who believeth therein and of them is he who believeth not therein and thy Lord is Best Aware of the corrupters
And if they deny thee say Unto me my work and unto you your work
Ye are innocent of what I do and I am innocent of what ye do
And of them are some who listen unto thee
But canst thou make the deaf to hear even though they apprehend not
And of them is he who looketh toward thee
But canst thou guide the blind even though they see not
Lo Allah wrongeth not mankind in aught but mankind wrong themselves
And on the day when He shall gather them together when it will seem as though they had tarried but an hour of the day recognising one another those will verily have perished who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided
Whether We let thee O Muhammad behold something of that which We promise them or whether We cause thee to die still unto Us is their return and Allah moreover is Witness over what they do
And for every nation there is a messenger
And when their messenger cometh on the Day of Judgment it will be judged between them fairly and they will not be wronged
And they say When will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful
Say I have no power to hurt or benefit myself save that which Allah willeth
For every nation there is an appointed time
When their time cometh then they cannot put it off an hour nor hasten it
Say Have ye thought When His doom cometh unto you as a raid by night or in the busy day what is there of it that the guilty ones desire to hasten
Is it only then when it hath befallen you that ye will believe
What
Believe now when until now ye have been hastening it on through disbelief
Then will it be said unto those who dealt unjustly Taste the torment of eternity
Are ye requited aught save what ye used to earn
And they ask thee to inform them saying Is it true
Say Yea by my Lord verily it is true and ye cannot escape
And if each soul that doeth wrong had all that is in the earth it would seek to ransom itself therewith and they will feel remorse within them when they see the doom
But it hath been judged between them fairly and they are not wronged
Lo verily all that is in the heavens and the earth is Allah s
Lo verily Allah s promise is true But most of them know not
He quickeneth and giveth death and unto Him ye will be returned
O mankind
There hath come unto you an exhortation from your Lord a balm for that which is in the breasts a guidance and a mercy for believers
Say In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy therein let them rejoice
It is better than what they hoard
Say Have ye considered what provision Allah hath sent down for you how ye have made of it lawful and unlawful
Hath Allah permitted you or do ye invent a lie concerning Allah
And what think those who invent a lie concerning Allah will be their plight upon the Day of Resurrection
Lo Allah truly is Bountiful toward mankind but most of them give not thanks
And thou Muhammad art not occupied with any business and thou recitest not a Lecture from this Scripture and ye mankind perform no act but We are Witness of you when ye are engaged therein
And not an atom s weight in the earth or in the sky escapeth your Lord nor what is less than that or greater than that but it is written in a clear Book
Lo verily the friends of Allah are those on whom fear cometh not nor do they grieve
Those who believe and keep their duty to Allah
Theirs are good tidings in the life of the world and in the Hereafter There is no changing the Words of Allah that is the Supreme Triumph
And let not their speech grieve thee O Muhammad
Lo power belongeth wholly to Allah
He is the Hearer the Knower
Lo is it not unto Allah that belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth
Those who follow aught instead of Allah follow not His partners
They follow only a conjecture and they do but guess
He it is Who hath appointed for you the night that ye should rest therein and the day giving sight
Lo herein verily are portents for a folk that heed
They say Allah hath taken unto Him a son Glorified be He
He hath no needs
His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
Ye have no warrant for this
Tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not
Say Verily those who invent a lie concerning Allah will not succeed
This world s portion will be theirs then unto Us is their return
Then We make them taste a dreadful doom because they used to disbelieve
Recite unto them the story of Noah when he told his people O my people
If my sojourn here and my reminding you by Allah s revelations are an offence unto you in Allah have I put my trust so decide upon your course of action you and your partners
Let not your course of action be in doubt for you Then have at me give me no respite
But if ye are averse I have asked of you no wage
My wage is the concern of Allah only and I am commanded to be of those who surrender unto Him
But they denied him so We saved him and those with him in the ship and made them viceroys in the earth while We drowned those who denied Our revelations
See then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned
Then after him We sent messengers unto their folk and they brought them clear proofs
But they were not ready to believe in that which they before denied
Thus print We on the hearts of the transgressors
Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our revelations but they were arrogant and were a guilty folk
And when the Truth from Our presence came unto them they said Lo this is mere magic
Moses said Speak ye so of the Truth when it hath come unto you
Is this magic Now magicians thrive not
They said Hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that faith in which we found our fathers and that you two may own the place of greatness in the land
We will not believe you two
And Pharaoh said Bring every cunning wizard unto me
And when the wizards came Moses said unto them Cast your cast
And when they had cast Moses said That which ye have brought is magic Lo
Allah will make it vain Lo
Allah upholdeth not the work of mischiefmakers
And Allah will vindicate the Truth by His words however much the guilty be averse
But none trusted Moses save some scions of his people and they were in fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs that he would persecute them Lo
Pharaoh was verily a tyrant in the land and lo he verily was of the wanton
And Moses said O my people
If ye have believed in Allah then put trust in Him if ye have indeed surrendered unto Him
They said In Allah we put trust
Our Lord
Oh make us not a lure for the wrongdoing folk
And of Thy mercy save us from the folk that disbelieve
And We inspired Moses and his brother saying Appoint houses for your people in Egypt and make your houses oratories and establish worship
And give good news to the believers
And Moses said Our Lord
Lo Thou hast given Pharaoh and his chiefs splendour and riches in the life of the world Our Lord that they may lead men astray from Thy way
Our Lord
Destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they believe not till they see the painful doom
He said Your prayer is heard
Do ye twain keep to the straight path and follow not the road of those who have no knowledge
And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and Pharaoh with his hosts pursued them in rebellion and transgression till when the fate of drowning overtook him he exclaimed I believe that there is no Allah save Him in Whom the Children of Israel believe and I am of those who surrender unto Him
What Now
When hitherto thou hast rebelled and been of the wrongdoers
But this day We save thee in thy body that thou mayst be a portent for those after thee
Lo most of mankind are heedless of Our portents
And We verily did allot unto the Children of Israel a fixed abode and did provide them with good things and they differed not until the knowledge came unto them
Lo thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
And if thou Muhammad art in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto thee then question those who read the Scripture that was before thee
Verily the Truth from thy Lord hath come unto thee
So be not thou of the waverers
And be not thou of those who deny the revelations of Allah for then wert thou of the losers
Lo those for whom the word of thy Lord concerning sinners hath effect will not believe
Though every token come unto them till they see the painful doom
If only there had been a community of all those that were destroyed of old that believed and profited by its belief as did the folk of Jonah
When they believed We drew off from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the world and gave them comfort for a while
And if thy Lord willed all who are in the earth would have believed together
Wouldst thou Muhammad compel men until they are believers
It is not for any soul to believe save by the permission of Allah
He hath set uncleanness upon those who have no sense
Say Behold what is in the heavens and the earth
But revelations and warnings avail not folk who will not believe
What expect they save the like of the days of those who passed away before them
Say Expect then
I am with you among the expectant
Then shall We save Our messengers and the believers in like manner as of old
It is incumbent upon Us to save believers
Say O Muhammad O mankind
If ye are in doubt of my religion then know that I worship not those whom ye worship instead of Allah but I worship Allah Who causeth you to die and I have been commanded to be of the believers
And O Muhammad set thy purpose resolutely for religion as a man by nature upright and be not of those who ascribe partners to Allah
And cry not beside Allah unto that which cannot profit thee nor hurt thee for if thou didst so then wert thou of the wrongdoers
If Allah afflicteth thee with some hurt there is none who can remove it save Him and if He desireth good for thee there is none who can repel His bounty
He striketh with it whom He will of his bondmen
He is the Forgiving the Merciful
Say O mankind
Now hath the Truth from your Lord come unto you
So whosoever is guided is guided only for the good of his soul and whosoever erreth erreth only against it
And I am not a warder over you
And O Muhammad follow that which is inspired in thee and forbear until Allah give judgment
And He is the Best of Judges
Alif
Lam
Ra
This is a Scripture the revelations whereof are perfected and then expounded It cometh from One Wise Informed
Saying Serve none but Allah Lo
I am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings
And bidding you Ask pardon of your Lord and turn to Him repentant He will cause you to enjoy a fair estate until a time appointed
He giveth His bounty unto every bountiful one But if ye turn away lo then I fear for you the retribution of an awful Day
Unto Allah is your return and He is Able to do all things
Lo now they fold up their breasts that they may hide their thoughts from Him
At the very moment when they cover themselves with their clothing Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim Lo
He is Aware of what is in the breasts of men
And there is not a beast in the earth but the sustenance thereof dependeth on Allah
He knoweth its habitation and its repository
All is in a clear Record
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was upon the water that He might try you which of you is best in conduct
Yet if thou O Muhammad sayest Lo ye will be raised again after death those who disbelieve will surely say This is naught but mere magic
And if We delay for them the doom until a reckoned time they will surely say What withholdeth it
Verily on the day when it cometh unto them it cannot be averted from them and that which they derided will surround them
And if we cause man to taste some mercy from Us and afterward withdraw it from him lo he is despairing thankless
And if We cause him to taste grace after some misfortune that had befallen him he saith The ills have gone from me Lo he is exultant boastful
Save those who persevere and do good works
Theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward
A likely thing that thou wouldst forsake aught of that which hath been revealed unto thee and that thy breast should be straitened for it because they say Why hath not a treasure been sent down for him or an angel come with him
Thou art but a warner and Allah is in charge of all things
Or they say He hath invented it
Say Then bring ten surahs the like thereof invented and call on everyone ye can beside Allah if ye are truthful
And if they answer not your prayer then know that it is revealed only in the knowledge of Allah and that there is no Allah save Him
Will ye then be of those who surrender
Whoso desireth the life of the world and its pomp We shall repay them their deeds herein and therein they will not be wronged
Those are they for whom is naught in the Hereafter save the Fire
All that they contrive here is vain and all that they are wont to do is fruitless
Is he to be counted equal with them who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord and a witness from Him reciteth it and before it was the Book of Moses an example and a mercy
Such believe therein and whoso disbelieveth therein of the clans the Fire is his appointed place
So be not thou in doubt concerning it
Lo it is the Truth from thy Lord but most of mankind believe not
Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah
Such will be brought before their Lord and the witnesses will say These are they who lied concerning their Lord
Now the curse of Allah is upon wrongdoers
Who debar men from the way of Allah and would have it crooked and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter
Such will not escape in the earth nor have they any protecting friends beside Allah
For them the torment will be double
They could not bear to hear and they used not to see
Such are they who have lost their souls and that which they used to invent hath failed them
Assuredly in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers
Lo those who believe and do good works and humble themselves before their Lord such are rightful owners of the Garden they will abide therein
The similitude of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seer and the hearer
Are they equal in similitude
Will ye not then be admonished
And We sent Noah unto his folk and he said Lo
I am a plain warner unto you
That ye serve none save Allah
Lo I fear for you the retribution of a painful Day
The chieftains of his folk who disbelieved said We see thee but a mortal like us and we see not that any follow thee save the most abject among us without reflection
We behold in you no merit above us nay we deem you liars
He said O my people
Bethink you if I rely on a clear proof from my Lord and there hath come unto me a mercy from His presence and it hath been made obscure to you can we compel you to accept it when ye are averse thereto
And O my people
I ask of you no wealth therefor
My reward is the concern only of Allah and I am not going to thrust away those who believe Lo they have to meet their Lord but I see you a folk that are ignorant
And O my people who would deliver me from Allah if I thrust them away
Will ye not then reflect
I say not unto you I have the treasures of Allah nor I have knowledge of the Unseen nor say I Lo
I am an angel
Nor say I unto those whom your eyes scorn that Allah will not give them good Allah knoweth best what is in their hearts Lo then indeed I should be of the wrongdoers
They said O Noah
Thou hast disputed with us and multiplied disputation with us now bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful
He said Only Allah will bring it upon you if He will and ye can by no means escape
My counsel will not profit you if I were minded to advise you if Allah s will is to keep you astray
He is your Lord and unto Him ye will be brought back
Or say they again He hath invented it
Say If I have invented it upon me be my crimes but I am innocent of all that ye commit
And it was inspired in Noah saying Noone of thy folk will believe save him who hath believed already
Be not distressed because of what they do
Build the ship under Our eyes and by Our inspiration and speak not unto Me on behalf of those who do wrong
Lo they will be drowned
And he was building the ship and every time that chieftains of his people passed him they made mock of him
He said Though ye make mock of Us yet We mock at you even as ye mock
And ye shall know to whom a punishment that will confound him cometh and upon whom a lasting doom will fall
Thus it was till when Our commandment came to pass and the oven gushed forth water We said Load therein two of every kind a pair the male and female and thy household save him against whom the word hath gone forth already and those who believe
And but a few were they who believed with him
And he said Embark therein
In the name of Allah be its course and its mooring
Lo my Lord is Forgiving Merciful
And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains and Noah cried unto his son and he was standing aloof O my son
Come ride with us and be not with the disbelievers
He said I shall betake me to some mountain that will save me from the water
Noah said This day there is none that saveth from the commandment of Allah save him on whom He hath had mercy
And the wave came in between them so he was among the drowned
And it was said O earth
Swallow thy water and O sky be cleared of clouds
And the water was made to subside And the commandment was fulfilled
And it the ship came to rest upon the mount AlJudi and it was said A far removal for wrongdoing folk
And Noah cried unto his Lord and said My Lord
Lo my son is of my household
Surely Thy promise is the truth and Thou are the Most Just of Judges
He said O Noah
Lo he is not of thy household lo he is of evil conduct so ask not of Me that whereof thou hast no knowledge
I admonish thee lest thou be among the ignorant
He said My Lord
Lo in Thee do I seek refuge from the sin that I should ask of Thee that whereof I have no knowledge
Unless Thou forgive me and have mercy on me I shall be among the lost
It was said unto him O Noah
Go thou down from the mountain with peace from Us and blessings upon thee and some nations that will spring from those with thee
There will be other nations unto whom We shall give enjoyment a long while and then a painful doom from Us will overtake them
This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee Muhammad
Thou thyself knewest it not nor did thy folk know it before this
Then have patience
Lo the sequel is for those who ward off evil
And unto the tribe of A ad We sent their brother Hud
He said O my people
Serve Allah
Ye have no other Allah save Him
Lo ye do but invent
O my people
I ask of you no reward for it
Lo my reward is the concern only of Him Who made me
Have ye then no sense
And O my people
Ask forgiveness of your Lord then turn unto Him repentant He will cause the sky to rain abundance on you and will add unto you strength to your strength
Turn not away guilty
They said O Hud
Thou hast brought us no clear proof and we are not going to forsake our gods on thy mere saying and we are not believers in thee
We say naught save that one of our gods hath possessed thee in an evil way
He said I call Allah to witness and do ye too bear witness that I am innocent of all that ye ascribe as partners to Allah
Beside Him
So try to circumvent me all of you give me no respite
Lo I have put my trust in Allah my Lord and your Lord
Not an animal but He doth grasp it by the forelock
Lo my Lord is on a straight path
And if ye turn away still I have conveyed unto you that wherewith I was sent unto you and my Lord will set in place of you a folk other than you Ye cannot injure Him at all
Lo my Lord is Guardian over all things
And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us We saved them from a harsh doom
And such were A ad
They denied the revelations of their Lord and flouted His messengers and followed the command of every froward potentate
And a curse was made to follow them in the world and on the Day of Resurrection
Lo A ad disbelieved in their Lord
A far removal for A ad the folk of Hud
And unto the tribe of Thamud We sent their brother Salih
He said O my people
Serve Allah Ye have no other Allah save Him
He brought you forth from the earth and hath made you husband it
So ask forgiveness of Him and turn unto Him repentant
Lo my Lord is Nigh Responsive
They said O Salih
Thou hast been among us hitherto as that wherein our hope was placed
Dost thou ask us not to worship what our fathers worshipped
Lo we verily are in grave doubt concerning that to which thou callest us
He said O my people
Bethink you if I am acting on clear proof from my Lord and there hath come unto me a mercy from Him who will save me from Allah if I disobey Him
Ye would add to me naught save perdition
O my people
This is the camel of Allah a token unto you so suffer her to feed in Allah s earth and touch her not with harm lest a near torment seize you
But they hamstrung her and then he said Enjoy life in your dwellingplace three days
This is a threat that will not be belied
So when Our commandment came to pass We saved Salih and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us from the ignominy of that day
Lo thy Lord He is the Strong the Mighty
And the awful Cry overtook those who did wrong so that morning found them prostrate in their dwellings
As though they had not dwelt there
Lo Thamud disbelieved in their Lord
A far removal for Thamud
And Our messengers cam unto Abraham with good news They said Peace
He answered Peace and delayed not to bring a roasted calf
And when he saw their hands reached not to it he mistrusted them and conceived a fear of them
They said Fear not
Lo we are sent unto the folk of Lot
And his wife standing by laughed when We gave her good tidings of the birth of Isaac and after Isaac of Jacob
She said Oh woe is me
Shall I bear a child when I am an old woman and this my husband is an old man
Lo this is a strange thing
They said Wonderest thou at the commandment of Allah
The mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you O people of the house Lo
He is Owner of Praise Owner of Glory
And when the awe departed from Abraham and the glad news reached him he pleaded with Us on behalf of the folk of Lot
Lo Abraham was mild imploring penitent
It was said O Abraham
Forsake this
Lo thy Lord s commandment hath gone forth and lo there cometh unto them a doom which cannot be repelled
And when Our messengers came unto Lot he was distressed and knew not how to protect them He said This is a distressful day
And his people came unto him running towards him and before then they used to commit abominations He said O my people
Here are my daughters
They are purer for you
Beware of Allah and degrade me not in the person of my guests
Is there not among you any upright man
They said Well thou knowest that we have no right to thy daughters and well thou knowest what we want
He said Would that I had strength to resist you or had some strong support among you
The messengers said O Lot
Lo we are messengers of thy Lord they shall not reach thee
So travel with thy people in a part of the night and let not one of you turn round all save thy wife
Lo that which smiteth them will smite her also
Lo their tryst is for the morning
Is not the morning nigh
So when Our commandment came to pass We overthrew that township and rained upon it stones of clay one after another
Marked with fire in the providence of thy Lord for the destruction of the wicked
And they are never far from the wrongdoers
And unto Midian We sent their brother Shu eyb
He said O my people
Serve Allah
Ye have no other Allah save Him
And give not short measure and short weight Lo
I see you welltodo and lo I fear for you the doom of a besetting Day
O my people
Give full measure and full weight in justice and wrong not people in respect of their goods And do not evil in the earth causing corruption
That which Allah leaveth with you is better for you if ye are believers and I am not a keeper over you
They said O Shu eyb
Doth thy way of prayer command thee that we should forsake that which our fathers used to worship or that we should leave off doing what we will with our own property
Lo thou art the mild the guide to right behaviour
He said O my people
Bethink you if I am acting on a clear proof from my Lord and He sustaineth me with fair sustenance from Him how can I concede aught to you
I desire not to do behind your backs that which I ask you not to do
I desire naught save reform so far as I am able
My welfare is only in Allah
In Him I trust and unto Him I turn repentant
And O my people
Let not the schism with me cause you to sin so that there befall you that which befell the folk of Noah and the folk of Hud and the folk of Salih and the folk of Lot are not far off from you
Ask pardon of your Lord and then turn unto Him repentant
Lo my Lord is Merciful Loving
They said O Shu eyb
We understand not much of that thou tellest and lo we do behold thee weak among us
But for thy family we should have stoned thee for thou art not strong against us
He said O my people
Is my family more to be honoured by you than Allah and ye put Him behind you neglected
Lo my Lord surroundeth what ye do
And O my people
Act according to your power lo I too am acting
Ye will soon know on whom there cometh a doom that will abase him and who it is that lieth
And watch
Lo I am a watcher with you
And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Shu eyb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us and the Awful Cry seized those who did injustice and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings
As though they had not dwelt there
A far removal for Midian even as Thamud had been removed afar
And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant
Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs but they did follow the command of Pharaoh and the command of Pharaoh was no right guide
He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and will lead them to the Fire for wateringplace
Ah hapless is the wateringplace whither they are led
A curse is made to follow them in the world and on the Day of Resurrection
Hapless is the gift that will be given them
That is something of the tidings of the townships which were destroyed of old
We relate it unto thee Muhammad Some of them are standing and some already reaped
We wronged them not but they did wrong themselves and their gods on whom they call beside Allah availed them naught when came thy Lord s command they added to them naught save ruin
Even thus is the grasp of thy Lord when He graspeth the townships while they are doing wrong
Lo His grasp is painful very strong
Lo herein verily there is a portent for those who fear the doom of the Hereafter
That is a day unto which mankind will be gathered and that is a day that will be witnessed
And We defer it only to a term already reckoned
On the day when it cometh no soul will speak except by His permission some among them will be wretched others glad
As for those who will be wretched on that day they will be in the Fire sighing and wailing will be their portion therein
Abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy Lord willeth
Lo thy Lord is Doer of what He will
And as for those who will be glad that day they will be in the Garden abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy Lord willeth a gift unfailing
So be not thou in doubt concerning that which these folk worship
They worship only as their fathers worshipped aforetime
Lo we shall pay them their whole due unabated
And we verily gave unto Moses the Scripture and there was strife thereupon and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord the case would have been judged between them and lo they are in grave doubt concerning it
And lo unto each thy Lord will verily repay his works in full
Lo He is Informed of what they do
So tread thou the straight path as thou art commanded and those who turn unto Allah with thee and transgress not
Lo He is Seer of what ye do
And incline not toward those who do wrong lest the Fire touch you and ye have no protecting friends against Allah and afterward ye would not be helped
Establish worship at the two ends of the day and in some watches of the night
Lo good deeds annul illdeeds
This is reminder for the mindful
And have patience O Muhammad for lo Allah loseth not the wages of the good
If only there had been among the generations before you men possessing a remnant of good sense to warn their people from corruption in the earth as did a few of those whom We saved from them
The wrongdoers followed that by which they were made sapless and were guilty
In truth thy Lord destroyed not the townships tyrannously while their folk were doing right
And if thy Lord had willed He verily would have made mankind one nation yet they cease not differing
Save him on whom thy Lord hath mercy and for that He did create them
And the Word of thy Lord hath been fulfilled Verily I shall fill hell with the jinn and mankind together
And all that We relate unto thee of the story of the messengers is in order that thereby We may make firm thy heart
And herein hath come unto thee the Truth and an exhortation and a reminder for believers
And say unto those who believe not Act according to your power Lo
And wait
Lo We too are waiting
And Allah s is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth and unto Him the whole matter will be returned
So worship Him and put thy trust in Him
Lo thy Lord is not unaware of what ye mortals do
Alif
Lam
Ra
These are verse of the Scripture that maketh plain
Lo We have revealed it a Lecture in Arabic that ye may understand
We narrate unto thee Muhammad the best of narratives in that We have inspired in thee this Qur an though aforetime thou wast of the heedless
When Joseph said unto his father O my father
Lo I saw in a dream eleven planets and the sun and the moon I saw them prostrating themselves unto me
He said O my dear son
Tell not thy brethren of thy vision lest they plot a plot against thee
Lo Satan is for man an open foe
Thus thy Lord will prefer thee and will teach thee the interpretation of events and will perfect His grace upon thee and upon the family of Jacob as He perfected it upon thy forefathers Abraham and Isaac
Lo thy Lord is Knower Wise
Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs of Allah s Sovereignty for the inquiring
When they said Verily Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are many though we be
Lo our father is in plain aberration
One said Kill Joseph or cast him to some other land so that your father s favour may be all for you and that ye may afterward be righteous folk
One among them said Kill not Joseph but if ye must be doing fling him into the depth of the pit some caravan will find him
They said O our father
Why wilt thou not trust us with Joseph when lo we are good friends to him
Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play
And lo we shall take good care of him
He said Lo in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you and I fear less the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him
They said If the wolf should devour him when we are so strong a band then surely we should have already perished
Then when they led him off and were of one mind that they should place him in the depth of the pit We inspired in him Thou wilt tell them of this deed of theirs when they know thee not
And they came weeping to their father in the evening
Saying O our father
We went racing one with another and left Joseph by our things and the wolf devoured him and thou believest not our saying even when we speak the truth
And they came with false blood on his shirt
He said Nay but your minds have beguiled you into something
My course is comely patience
And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought in that predicament which ye describe
And there came a caravan and they sent their waterdrawer
He let down his pail into the pit
He said Good luck
Here is a youth And they hid him as a treasure and Allah was Aware of what they did
And they sold him for a low price a number of silver coins and they attached no value to him
And he of Egypt who purchased him said unto his wife Receive him honourably
Perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son
Thus we established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events
And Allah was predominant in His career but most of mankind know not
And And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge
Thus We reward the good
And she in whose house he was asked of him an evil act She bolted the doors and said Come
He said I seek refuge in Allah
Lo he is my lord who hath treated me honourably
Lo wrongdoers never prosper
She verily desired him and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his Lord
Thus it was that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness
Lo he was of Our chosen slaves
And they raced with one another to the door and she tore his shirt from behind and they met her lord and master at the door
She said What shall be his reward who wisheth evil to thy folk save prison or a painful doom
Joseph said She it was who asked of me an evil act
And a witness of her own folk testified If his shirt is torn from before then she speaketh truth and he is of the liars
And if his shirt is torn from behind then she hath lied and he is of the truthful
So when he saw his shirt torn from behind he said Lo this is of the guile of you women
Lo the guile of you is very great
O Joseph Turn away from this and thou O woman ask forgiveness for thy sin
Lo thou art of the faulty
And women in the city said The ruler s wife is asking of her slaveboy an illdeed
Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love
We behold her in plain aberration
And when she heard of their sly talk she sent to them and prepared for them a cushioned couch to lie on at the feast and gave to every one of them a knife and said to Joseph Come out unto them
And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands exclaiming Allah Blameless
This is no a human being
This is not other than some gracious angel
She said This is he on whose account ye blamed me
I asked of him an evil act but he proved continent but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned and verily shall be of those brought low
He said O my Lord
Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me and if Thou fend not off their wiles from me I shall incline unto them and become of the foolish
So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him
Lo He is Hearer Knower
And it seemed good to them the menfolk after they had seen the signs of his innocence to imprison him for a time
And two young men went to prison with him
One of them said I dreamed that I was pressing wine
The other said I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating
Announce unto us the interpretation for we see thee of those good at interpretation
He said The food which ye are given daily shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you
This is of that which my Lord hath taught me
Lo I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter
And I have followed the religion of my fathers Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to Allah
This is of the bounty of Allah unto us the seed of Abraham and unto mankind but most men give not thanks
O my fellowprisoners
Are divers lords better or Allah the One Almighty
Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named ye and your fathers
Allah hath revealed no sanction for them
The decision rests with Allah only Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him
This is the right religion but most men know not
O my two fellowprisoners
As for one of you he will pour out wine for his lord to drink and as for the other he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head
Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire
And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released Mention me in the presence of thy lord
But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord so he Joseph stayed in prison for some years
And the king said Lo I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and seven green ears of corn and other seven dry
O notables
Expound for me my vision if ye can interpret dreams
They answered Jumbled dreams
And we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams
And he of the two who was released and now at length remembered said I am going to announce unto you the interpretation therefore send me forth
And when he came to Joseph in the prison he exclaimed Joseph
O thou truthful one
Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other seven dry that I may return unto the people so that they may know
He said Ye shall sow seven years as usual but that which ye reap leave it in the ear all save a little which ye eat
Then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that ye have prepared for them save a little of that which ye have stored
Then after that will come a year when the people will have plenteous crops and when they will press wine and oil
And the king said Bring him unto me
And when the messenger came unto him he Joseph said Return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the women who cut their hands
Lo my Lord knoweth their guile
He the king then sent for those women and said What happened when ye asked an evil act of Joseph
They answered Allah Blameless
We know no evil of him
Said the wife of the ruler Now the truth is out
I asked of him an evil act and he is surely of the truthful
Then Joseph said I asked for this that he my lord may know that I betrayed him not in secret and that surely Allah guideth not the snare of the betrayers
I do not exculpate myself
Lo the human soul enjoineth unto evil save that whereon my Lord hath mercy
Lo my Lord is Forgiving Merciful
And the king said Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person
And when he had talked with him he said Lo thou art today in our presence established and trusted
He said Set me over the storehouses of the land
Lo I am a skilled custodian
Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land
He was the owner of it where he pleased
We reach with Our mercy whom We will We lose not the reward of the good
And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and ward off evil
And Joseph s brethren came and presented themselves before him and he knew them but they knew him not
And when he provided them with their provision he said Bring unto me a brother of yours from your father
See ye not that I fill up the measure and I am the best of hosts
And if ye bring him not unto me then there shall be no measure for you with me nor shall ye draw near
They said We will try to win him from his father that we will surely do
He said unto his young men Place their merchandise in their saddlebags so that they may know it when they go back to their folk and so will come again
So when they went back to their father they said O our father
The measure is denied us so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure surely we will guard him well
He said Can I entrust him to you save as I entrusted his brother to you aforetime
Allah is better at guarding and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy
And when they opened their belongings they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them They said O our father
What more can we ask
Here is our merchandise returned to us
We shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother and we shall have the extra measure of a camel load
This that we bring now is a light measure
He said I will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of Allah that ye will bring him back to me unless ye are surrounded
And when they gave him their undertaking he said Allah is the Warden over what we say
And he said O my sons
Go not in by one gate go in by different gates
I can naught avail you as against Allah
Lo the decision rests with Allah only
In Him do I put my trust and in Him let all the trusting put their trust
And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined it would have naught availed them as against Allah it was but a need of Jacob s soul which he thus satisfied and lo he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him but most of mankind know not
And when they went in before Joseph he took his brother unto him saying Lo
I even I am thy brother therefore sorrow not for what they did
And when he provided them with their provision he put the drinkingcup in his brother s saddlebag and then a crier cried O camelriders
Lo ye are surely thieves
They cried coming toward them What is it ye have lost
They said We have lost the king s cup and he who bringeth it shall have a camelload and I said Joseph am answerable for it
They said By Allah well ye know we came not to do evil in the land and are no thieves
They said And what shall be the penalty for it if ye prove liars
They said The penalty for it He in whose bag the cup is found he is the penalty for it
Thus we requite wrongdoers
Then he Joseph began the search with their bags before his brother s bag then he produced it from his brother s bag
Thus did We contrive for Joseph
He could not have taken his brother according to the king s law unless Allah willed
We raise by grades of mercy whom We will and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing
They said If he stealeth a brother of his stole before
But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them He said within himself Ye are in worse case and Allah knoweth best the truth of that which ye allege
They said O ruler of the land
Lo he hath a very aged father so take one of us instead of him
Lo we behold thee of those who do kindness
He said Allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property then truly we should be wrongdoers
So When they despaired of moving him they conferred together apart
The eldest of them said Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in Allah s name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime
Therefore I shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or Allah judgeth for me
He is the Best of Judges
Return unto your father and say O our father
Lo thy son hath stolen
We testify only to that which we know we are not guardians of the Unseen
Ask the township where we were and the caravan with which we travelled hither
Lo we speak the truth
And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him he said Nay but your minds have beguiled you into something
My course is comely patience
It may be that Allah will bring them all unto me Lo
He only He is the Knower the Wise
And he turned away from them and said Alas my grief for Joseph
And his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing
They said By Allah thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish
He said I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah and I know from Allah that which ye know not
Go O my sons and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother and despair not of the Spirit of Allah
Lo none despaireth of the Spirit of Allah save disbelieving folk
And when they came again before him Joseph they said O ruler
Misfortune hath touched us and our folk and we bring but poor merchandise so fill for us the measure and be charitable unto us Lo
Allah will requite the charitable
He said Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance
They said Is it indeed thou who art Joseph
He said I am Joseph and this is my brother
Allah hath shown us favour
Lo he who wardeth off evil and endureth findeth favour for lo Allah loseth not the wages of the kindly
They said By Allah verily Allah hath preferred thee above us and we were indeed sinful
He said Have no fear this day
May Allah forgive you and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy
Go with this shirt of mine and lay it on my father s face he will become again a seer and come to me with all your folk
When the caravan departed their father had said Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph though ye call me dotard
Those around him said By Allah lo thou art in thine old aberration
Then when the bearer of glad tidings came he laid it on his face and he became a seer once more He said Said I not unto you that I know from Allah that which ye know not
They said O our father
Ask forgiveness of our sins for us for lo we were sinful
He said I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord
Lo He is the Forgiving the Merciful
And when they came in before Joseph he took his parents unto him and said Come into Egypt safe if Allah will
And he placed his parents on the dais and they fell down before him prostrate and he said O my father
This is the interpretation of my dream of old
My Lord hath made it true and He hath shown me kindness since He took me out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren
Lo my Lord is tender unto whom He will
He is the Knower the Wise
O my Lord
Thou hast given me something of sovereignty and hast taught me something of the interpretation of events Creator of the heavens and the earth
Thou art my Protecting Guardian in the world and the Hereafter
Make me to die muslim unto Thee and join me to the righteous
This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee Muhammad
Thou wast not present with them when they fixed their plan and they were scheming
And though thou try much most men will not believe
Thou askest them no fee for it
It is naught else than a reminder unto the peoples
How many a portent is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by with face averted
And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners unto Him
Deem they themselves secure from the coming on them of a pall of Allah s punishment or the coming of the Hour suddenly while they are unaware
Say This is my Way I call on Allah with sure knowledge
I and whosoever followeth me Glory be to Allah and I am not of the idolaters
We sent not before thee any messengers save men whom We inspired from among the folk of the townships Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them
And verily the abode of the Hereafter for those who ward off evil is best
Have ye then no sense
Till when the messengers despaired and thought that they were denied then came unto them Our help and whom We would was saved
And Our wrath cannot be warded from the guilty
In their history verily there is a lesson for men of understanding
It is no invented story but a confirmation of the existing Scripture and a detailed explanation of everything and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe
Alif
Lam

These are verses of the Scripture
That which is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth but most of mankind believe not
Allah it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports then mounted the Throne and compelled the sun and the moon to be of service each runneth unto an appointed term He ordereth the course He detaileth the revelations that haply ye may be certain of the meeting with your Lord
And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and flowing streams and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses male and female
He covereth the night with the day
Lo herein verily are portents for people who take thought
And in the Earth are neighbouring tracts vineyards and ploughed lands and datepalms like and unlike which are watered with one water
And we have made some of them to excel others in fruit
Lo herein verily are portents for people who have sense
And if thou wonderest then wondrous is their saying When we are dust are we then forsooth to be raised in a new creation
Such are they who disbelieve in their Lord such have carcans on their necks such are rightful owners of the Fire they will abide therein
And they bid thee hasten on the evil rather than the good when exemplary punishments have indeed occurred before them
But lo thy Lord is rich in pardon for mankind despite their wrong and lo thy Lord is strong in punishment
Those who disbelieve say If only some portent were sent down upon him from his Lord
Thou art a warner only and for every folk a guide
Allah knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs absorb and that which they grow
And everything with Him is measured
He is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible the Great the High Exalted
Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who noiseth it abroad he who lurketh in the night and he who goeth freely in the daytime
For him are angels ranged before him and behind him who guard him by Allah s command Lo
Allah changeth not the condition of a folk until they first change that which is in their hearts and if Allah willeth misfortune for a folk there is none that can repel it nor have they a defender beside Him
He it is Who showeth you the lightning a fear and a hope and raiseth the heavy clouds
The thunder hymneth His praise and so do the angels for awe of Him He launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they dispute in doubt concerning Allah and He is mighty in wrath
Unto Him is the real prayer
Those unto whom they pray beside Allah respond to them not at all save as is the response to one who stretcheth forth his hands toward water asking that it may come unto his mouth and it will never reach it
The prayer of disbelievers goeth far astray
And unto Allah falleth prostrate whosoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly as do their shadows in the morning and the evening hours
Say O Muhammad Who is Lord of the heavens and the earth
Say Allah
Say Take ye then others beside Him for protectors which even for themselves have neither benefit nor hurt
Say Is the blind man equal to the seer or is darkness equal to light
Or assign they unto Allah partners who created the like of His creation so that the creation which they made and His creation seemed alike to them
Say Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the One the Almighty
He sendeth down water from the sky so that valleys flow according to their measure and the flood beareth on its surface swelling foam from that which they smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth a foam like unto it thus Allah coineth the similitude of the true and the false
Then as for the foam it passeth away as scum upon the banks while as for that which is of use to mankind it remaineth in the earth
Thus Allah coineth the similitudes
For those who answered Allah s call is bliss and for those who answered not His call if they had all that is in the earth and therewith the like thereof they would proffer it as ransom Such will have a woeful reckoning and their habitation will be hell a dire abode
Is he who knoweth that what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth like him who is blind
But only men of understanding heed
Such as keep the pact of Allah and break not the covenant
Such as unite that which Allah hath commandeth should be joined and fear their Lord and dread a woeful reckoning
Such as persevere in seeking their Lord s Countenance and are regular in prayer and spend of that which We bestow upon them secretly and openly and overcome evil with good
Theirs will be the sequel of the heavenly Home
Gardens of Eden which they enter along with all who do right of their fathers and their helpmeets and their seed
The angels enter unto them from every gate
Saying Peace be unto you because ye persevered
Ah passing sweet will be the sequel of the heavenly Home
And those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it and sever that which Allah hath commanded should be joined and make mischief in the earth theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode
Allah enlargeth livelihood for whom He will and straiteneth it for whom He will and they rejoice in the life of the world whereas the life of the world is but brief comfort as compared with the Hereafter
Those who disbelieve say If only a portent were sent down upon him from his Lord
Say Lo Allah sendeth whom He will astray and guideth unto Himself all who turn unto Him
Who have believed and whose hearts have rest in the remembrance of Allah
Verily in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest
Those who believe and do right Joy is for them and bliss their journey s end
Thus We send thee O Muhammad unto a nation before whom other nations have passed away that thou mayst recite unto them that which We have inspired in thee while they are disbelievers in the Beneficent
Say He is my Lord there is no Allah save Him
In Him do I put my trust and unto Him is my recourse
Had it been possible for a Lecture to cause the mountains to move or the earth to be torn asunder or the dead to speak this Qur an would have done so
Nay but Allah s is the whole command
Do not those who believe know that had Allah willed He could have guided all mankind
As for those who disbelieve disaster ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do or it dwelleth near their home until the threat of Allah come to pass
Lo Allah faileth not to keep the tryst
And verily messengers of Allah were mocked before thee but long I bore with those who disbelieved
At length I seized them and how awful was My punishment
Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul as he who is aware of nothing
Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners
Say Name them
Is it that ye would inform Him of something which He knoweth not in the earth Or is it but a way of speaking
Nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve and they are kept from the right road
He whom Allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide
For them is torment in the life of the world and verily the doom of the Hereafter is more painful and they have no defender from Allah
A similitude of the Garden which is promised unto those who keep their duty to Allah Underneath it rivers flow its food is everlasting and its shade this is the reward of those who keep their duty while the reward of disbelievers is the Fire
Those unto whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in that which is revealed unto thee
And of the clans there are who deny some of it
Say I am commanded only that I serve Allah and ascribe unto Him no partner
Unto Him I cry and unto Him is my return
Thus have We revealed it a decisive utterance in Arabic and if thou shouldst follow their desires after that which hath come unto thee of knowledge then truly wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting friend nor defender
And verily We sent messengers to mankind before thee and We appointed for them wives and offspring and it was not given to any messenger that he should bring a portent save by Allah s leave
For everything there is a time prescribed
Allah effaceth what He will and establisheth what He will and with Him is the source of ordinance
Whether We let thee see something of that which We have promised them or make thee die before its happening thine is but conveyance of the message
Ours the reckoning
See they not how we aim to the land reducing it of its outlying parts
When Allah doometh there is none that can postpone His doom and He is swift at reckoning
Those who were before them plotted but all plotting is Allah s
He knoweth that which each soul earneth
The disbelievers will come to know for whom will be the sequel of the heavenly Home
They who disbelieve say Thou art no messenger of Allah
Say Allah and whosoever hath knowledge of the Scripture is sufficient witness between me and you
Alif
Lam
Ra
This is a Scripture which We have revealed unto thee Muhammad that thereby thou mayst bring forth mankind from darkness unto light by the permission of their Lord unto the path of the Mighty the Owner of Praise
Allah unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and woe unto the disbelievers from an awful doom
Those who love the life of the world more than the Hereafter and debar men from the way of Allah and would have it crooked such are far astray
And We never sent a messenger save with the language of his folk that he might make the message clear for them
Then Allah sendeth whom He will astray and guideth whom He will
He is the Mighty the Wise
We verily sent Moses with Our revelations saying Bring thy people forth from darkness unto light And remind them of the days of Allah
Lo therein are revelations for each steadfast thankful heart
And remind them how Moses said unto his people Remember Allah s favour unto you when He delivered you from Pharaoh s folk who were afflicting you with dreadful torment and were slaying your sons and sparing your women that was a tremendous trial from your Lord
And when your Lord proclaimed If ye give thanks I will give you more but if ye are thankless lo My punishment is dire
And Moses said Though ye and all who are in the earth prove thankless lo
Allah verily is Absolute Owner of Praise
Hath not the history of those before you reached you the folk of Noah and the tribes of A ad and Thamud and those after them
None save Allah knoweth them
Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs but they thrust their hands into their mouths and said Lo we disbelieve in that wherewith ye have been sent and lo we are in grave doubt concerning that to which ye call us
Their messengers said Can there be doubt concerning Allah the Creator of the heavens and the earth
He calleth you that He may forgive you your sins and reprieve you unto an appointed term
They said Ye are but mortals like us who would fain turn us away from what our fathers used to worship
Then bring some clear warrant
Their messengers said unto them We are but mortals like you but Allah giveth grace unto whom He will of His slaves
It is not ours to bring you a warrant unless by the permission of Allah
In Allah let believers put their trust
How should we not put our trust in Allah when He hath shown us our ways
We surely will endure the hurt ye do us
In Allah let the trusting put their trust
And those who disbelieved said unto their messengers Verily we will drive you out from our land unless ye return to our religion
Then their Lord inspired them saying Verily we shall destroy the wrongdoers
And verily We shall make you to dwell in the land after them
This is for him who feareth My Majesty and feareth My threats
And they sought help from their Lord and every froward potentate was bought to naught
Hell is before him and he is made to drink a festering water
Which he sippeth but can hardly swallow and death cometh unto him from every side while yet he cannot die and before him is a harsh doom
A similitude of those who disbelieve in their Lord Their works are as ashes which the wind bloweth hard upon a stormy day
They have no control of aught that they have earned
That is the extreme failure
Hast thou not seen that Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth
If He will He can remove you and bring in some new creation
And that is no great matter for Allah
They all come forth unto their Lord Then those who were despised say unto those who were scornful We were unto you a following can ye then avert from us aught of Allah s doom
They say Had Allah guided us we should have guided you
Whether we rage or patiently endure is now all one for us we have no place of refuge
And Satan saith when the matter hath been decided Lo
Allah promised you a promise of truth and I promised you then failed you
And I had no power over you save that I called unto you and ye obeyed me
So blame not but blame yourselves
I cannot help you nor can ye help me Lo
I disbelieved in that which ye before ascribed to me
Lo for wrongdoers is a painful doom
And those who believed and did good works are made to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow therein abiding by permission of their Lord their greeting therein Peace
Seest thou not how Allah coineth a similitude A goodly saying as a goodly tree its root set firm its branches reaching into heaven
Giving its fruit at every season by permission of its Lord
Allah coineth the similitudes for mankind in order that they may reflect
And the similitude of a bad saying is as a bad tree uprooted from upon the earth possessing no stability
Allah confirmeth those who believe by a firm saying in the life of the world and in the Hereafter and Allah sendeth wrongdoers astray
And Allah doeth what He will
Hast thou not seen those who gave the grace of Allah in exchange for thanklessness and led their people down to the Abode of Loss
Even to hell
They are exposed thereto A hapless end
And they set up rivals to Allah that they may mislead men from His way
Say Enjoy life while ye may for lo your journey s end will be the Fire
Tell My bondmen who believe to establish worship and spend of that which We have given them secretly and publicly before a day cometh wherein there will be neither traffick nor befriending
Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and causeth water to descend from the sky thereby producing fruits as food for you and maketh the ships to be of service unto you that they may run upon the sea at His command and hath made of service unto you the rivers
And maketh the sun and the moon constant in their courses to be of service unto you and hath made of service unto you the night and the day
And He giveth you of all ye ask of Him and if ye would count the bounty of Allah ye cannot reckon it
Lo man is verily a wrongdoer an ingrate
And when Abraham said My Lord
Make safe this territory and preserve me and my sons from serving idols
My Lord
Lo they have led many of mankind astray
But whoso followeth me he verily is of me
And whoso disobeyeth me Still Thou art Forgiving Merciful
Our Lord
Lo
I have settled some of my posterity in an uncultivable valley near unto Thy holy House our Lord that they may establish proper worship so incline some hearts of men that they may yearn toward them and provide Thou them with fruits in order that they may be thankful
Our Lord Lo
Thou knowest that which we hide and that which we proclaim
Nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah
Praise be to Allah Who hath given me in my old age Ishmael and Isaac
Lo my Lord is indeed the Hearer of Prayer
My Lord
Make me to establish proper worship and some of my posterity also our Lord and accept my prayer
Our Lord
Forgive me and my parents and believers on the day when the account is cast
Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do
He but giveth them a respite till a day when eyes will stare in terror
As they come hurrying on in fear their heads upraised their gaze returning not to them and their hearts as air
And warn mankind of a day when the doom will come upon them and those who did wrong will say Our Lord
Reprieve us for a little while We will obey Thy call and will follow the messengers
It will be answered Did ye not swear before that there would be no end for you
And have ye not dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves of old and hath it not become plain to you how We dealt with them and made examples for you
Verily they have plotted their plot and their plot is with Allah though their plot were one whereby the mountains should be moved
So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His messengers
Lo Allah is Mighty Able to Requite the wrong
On the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth and the heavens also will be changed and they will come forth unto Allah the One the Almighty
Thou wilt see the guilty on that day linked together in chains
Their raiment of pitch and the Fire covering their faces
That Allah may repay each soul what it hath earned
Lo Allah is swift at reckoning
This is a clear message for mankind in order that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is only One Allah and that men of understanding may take heed
Alif

These are verses of the Scripture and a plain Reading
It may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were Muslims
Let them eat and enjoy life and let false hope beguile them
They will come to know
And We destroyed no township but there was a known decree for it
No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind
And they say O thou unto whom the Reminder is revealed lo thou art indeed a madman
Why bringest thou not angels unto us if thou art of the truthful
We send not down the angels save with the Fact and in that case the disbelievers would not be tolerated
We even We reveal the Reminder and lo We verily are its Guardian
We verily sent messengers before thee among the factions of the men of old
And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him
Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty
They believe not therein though the example of the men of old hath gone before
And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting through it
They would say Our sight is wrong nay but we are folk bewitched
And verily in the heaven we have set mansions of the stars and We have beautified it for beholders
And We have guarded it from every outcast devil
Save him who stealeth the hearing and them doth a clear flame pursue
And the earth have We spread out and placed therein firm hills and caused each seemly thing to grow therein
And we have given unto you livelihoods therein and unto those for whom ye provide not
And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof
And we send it not down save in appointed measure
And We send the winds fertilising and cause water to descend from the sky and give it you to drink
It is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof
Lo and it is We even We Who quicken and give death and We are the Inheritor
And verily We know the eager among you and verily We know the laggards
Lo thy Lord will gather them together
Lo He is Wise Aware
Verily We created man of potter s clay of black mud altered
And the jinn did We create aforetime of essential fire
And remember when thy Lord said unto the angels Lo I am creating a mortal out of potter s clay of black mud altered
So when I have made him and have breathed into him of My Spirit do ye fall down prostrating yourselves unto him
So the angels fell prostrate all of them together
Save Iblis
He refused to be among the prostrate
He said O Iblis
What aileth thee that thou art not among the prostrate
He said I am not one to prostrate myself unto a mortal whom Thou hast created out of potter s clay of black mud altered
He said Then go thou forth from hence for lo thou art outcast
And lo the curse shall be upon thee till the Day of Judgment
He said My Lord
Reprieve me till the day when they are raised
He said Then lo thou art of those reprieved
Till the Day of appointed time
He said My Lord
Because Thou hast sent me astray I verily shall adorn the path of error for them in the earth and shall mislead them every one
Save such of them as are Thy perfectly devoted slaves
He said This is a right course incumbent upon Me
Lo as for My slaves thou hast no power over any of them save such of the froward as follow thee
And lo for all such hell will be the promised place
It hath seven gates and each gate hath an appointed portion
Lo those who ward off evil are among gardens and watersprings
And it is said unto them Enter them in peace secure
And We remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts
As brethren face to face they rest on couches raised
Toil cometh not unto them there nor will they be expelled from thence
Announce O Muhammad unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving the Merciful
And that My doom is the dolorous doom
And tell them of Abraham s guests
How when they came in unto him and said Peace
He said Lo we are afraid of you
They said Be not afraid
Lo we bring thee good tidings of a boy possessing wisdom
He said Bring ye me good tidings of a son when old age hath overtaken me
Of what then can ye bring good tidings
They said We bring thee good tidings in truth
So be not thou of the despairing
He said And who despaireth of the mercy of his Lord save those who are astray
He said And afterward what is your business O ye messengers of Allah
They said We have been sent unto a guilty folk
All save the family of Lot
Them we shall deliver every one
Except his wife of whom We had decreed that she should be of those who stay behind
And when the messengers came unto the family of Lot
He said Lo ye are folk unknown to me
They said Nay but we bring thee that concerning which they keep disputing
And bring thee the Truth and lo we are truthtellers
So travel with thy household in a portion of the night and follow thou their backs
Let none of you turn round but go whither ye are commanded
And We made plain the case to him that the root of them who did wrong was to be cut at early morn
And the people of the city came rejoicing at the news of new arrivals
He said Lo they are my guests
Affront me not
And keep your duty to Allah and shame me not
They said Have we not forbidden you from entertaining anyone
He said Here are my daughters if ye must be doing so
By thy life O Muhammad they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching death
Then the Awful Cry overtook them at the sunrise
And We utterly confounded them and We rained upon them stones of heated clay
Lo therein verily are portents for those who read the signs
And lo it is upon a road still uneffaced
Lo therein is indeed a portent for believers
And the dwellers in the wood indeed were evildoers
So we took vengeance on them and lo they both are on a highroad plain to see
And the dwellers in AlHijr denied Our messengers
And we gave them Our revelations but they were averse to them
And they used to hew out dwellings from the hills wherein they dwelt secure
But the Awful Cry overtook them at the morning hour
And that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not
We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save with truth and lo the Hour is surely coming
So forgive O Muhammad with a gracious forgiveness
Thy Lord He is the AllWise Creator
We have given thee seven of the oftrepeated verses and the great Qur an
Strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoin and be not grieved on their account and lower thy wing in tenderness for the believers
And say Lo I even I am a plain warner
Such as We send down for those who make division
Those who break the Qur an into parts
Them by thy Lord We shall question every one
Of what they used to do
So proclaim that which thou art commanded and withdraw from the idolaters
Lo We defend thee from the scoffers
Who set some other god along with Allah
But they will come to know
Well know We that thy bosom is oppressed by what they say
But hymn the praise of thy Lord and be of those who make prostration unto Him
And serve thy Lord till the Inevitable cometh unto thee
The commandment of Allah will come to pass so seek not ye to hasten it
Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him
He sendeth down the angels with the Spirit of His command unto whom He will of His bondmen saying Warn mankind that there is no Allah save Me so keep your duty unto Me
He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth
High be He Exalted above all that they associate with Him
He hath created man from a drop of fluid yet behold he is an open opponent
And the cattle hath He created whence ye have warm clothing and uses and whereof ye eat
And wherein is beauty for you when ye bring them home and when ye take them out to pasture
And they bear your loads for you unto a land ye could not reach save with great trouble to yourselves
Lo your Lord is Full of Pity Merciful
And horses and mules and asses hath He created that ye may ride them and for ornament
And He createth that which ye know not
And Allah s is the direction of the way and some roads go not straight
And had He willed He would have led you all aright
He it is Who sendeth down water from the sky whence ye have drink and whence are trees on which ye send your beasts to pasture
Therewith He causeth crops to grow for you and the olive and the datepalm and grapes and all kinds of fruit
Lo herein is indeed a portent for people who reflect
And He hath constrained the night and the day and the sun and the moon to be of service unto you and the stars are made subservient by His command
Lo herein indeed are portents for people who have sense
And whatsoever He hath created for you in the earth of divers hues lo therein is indeed a portent for people who take heed
And He it is Who hath constrained the sea to be of service that ye eat fresh meat from thence and bring forth from thence ornaments which ye wear
And thou seest the ships ploughing it that ye mankind may seek of His bounty and that haply ye may give thanks
And He hath cast into the earth firm hills that it quake not with you and streams and roads that ye may find a way
And landmarks too and by the star they find a way
Is He then Who createth as him who createth not
Will ye not then remember
And if ye would count the favour of Allah ye cannot reckon it
Lo Allah is indeed Forgiving Merciful
And Allah knoweth that which ye keep hidden and that which ye proclaim
Those unto whom they cry beside Allah created naught but are themselves created
They are dead not living And they know not when they will be raised
Your Allah is One Allah
But as for those who believe not in the Hereafter their hearts refuse to know for they are proud
Assuredly Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim
Lo He loveth not the proud
And when it is said unto them What hath your Lord revealed they say Mere fables of the men of old
That they may bear their burdens undiminished on the Day of Resurrection with somewhat of the burdens of those whom they mislead without knowledge
Ah evil is that which they bear
Those before them plotted so Allah struck at the foundations of their building and then the roof fell down upon them from above them and the doom came on them whence they knew not
Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and will say Where are My partners for whose sake ye opposed My guidance
Those who have been given knowledge will say Disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers
Whom the angels cause to die while they are wronging themselves Then will they make full submission saying We used not to do any wrong
Nay
Surely Allah is Knower of what ye used to do
So enter the gates of hell to dwell therein for ever
Woeful indeed will be the lodging of the arrogant
And it is said unto those who ward off evil What hath your Lord revealed
They say Good For those who do good in this world there is a good reward and the home of the Hereafter will be better
Pleasant indeed will be the home of those who ward off evil
Gardens of Eden which they enter underneath which rivers flow wherein they have what they will
Thus Allah repayeth those who ward off evil
Those whom the angels cause to die when they are good They say Peace be unto you
Enter the Garden because of what ye used to do
Await they aught say that the angels should come unto them or thy Lord s command should come to pass
Even so did those before them
Allah wronged them not but they did wrong themselves
So that the evils of what they did smote them and that which they used to mock surrounded them
And the idolaters say Had Allah willed we had not worshipped aught beside Him we and our fathers nor had we forbidden aught without command from Him
Even so did those before them
Are the messengers charged with aught save plain conveyance of the message
And verily We have raised in every nation a messenger proclaiming Serve Allah and shun false gods
Then some of them there were whom Allah guided and some of them there were upon whom error had just hold
Do but travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for the deniers
Even if thou O Muhammad desirest their right guidance still Allah assuredly will not guide him who misleadeth Such have no helpers
And they swear by Allah their most binding oaths that Allah will not raise up him who dieth
Nay but it is a promise binding upon Him in truth but most of mankind know not
That He may explain unto them that wherein they differ and that those who disbelieved may know that they were liars
And Our word unto a thing when We intend it is only that We say unto it Be and it is
And those who became fugitives for the cause of Allah after they had been oppressed We verily shall give them goodly lodging in the world and surely the reward of the Hereafter is greater if they but knew
Such as are steadfast and put their trust in Allah
And We sent not as Our messengers before thee other than men whom We inspired Ask the followers of the Remembrance if ye know not
With clear proofs and writings and We have revealed unto thee the Remembrance that thou mayst explain to mankind that which hath been revealed for them and that haply they may reflect
Are they who plan illdeeds then secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the doom will not come on them whence they know not
Or that He will not seize them in their going to and fro so that there be no escape for them
Or that He will not seize them with a gradual wasting
Lo thy Lord is indeed Full of Pity Merciful
Have they not observed all things that Allah hath created how their shadows incline to the right and to the left making prostration unto Allah and they are lowly
And unto Allah maketh prostration whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth of living creatures and the angels also and they are not proud
They fear their Lord above them and do what they are bidden
Allah hath said Choose not two gods
There is only One Allah
So of Me Me only be in awe
Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth and religion is His for ever
Will ye then fear any other than Allah
And whatever of comfort ye enjoy it is from Allah
Then when misfortune reacheth you unto Him ye cry for help
And afterward when He hath rid you of the misfortune behold a set of you attribute partners to their Lord
So as to deny that which We have given them
Then enjoy life while ye may for ye will come to know
And they assign a portion of that which We have given them unto what they know not
By Allah but ye will indeed be asked concerning all that ye used to invent
And they assign unto Allah daughters Be He Glorified and unto themselves what they desire
When if one of them receiveth tidings of the birth of a female his face remaineth darkened and he is wroth inwardly
He hideth himself from the folk because of the evil of that whereof he hath had tidings asking himself Shall he keep it in contempt or bury it beneath the dust
Verily evil is their judgment
For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil similitude and Allah s is the Sublime Similitude
He is the Mighty the Wise
If Allah were to take mankind to task for their wrongdoing he would not leave hereon a living creature but He reprieveth them to an appointed term and when their term cometh they cannot put it off an hour nor yet advance it
And they assign unto Allah that which they themselves dislike and their tongues expound the lie that the better portion will be theirs
Assuredly theirs will be the Fire and they will be abandoned
By Allah We verily sent messengers unto the nations before thee but the devil made their deeds fairseeming unto them
So he is their patron this day and theirs will be a painful doom
And We have revealed the Scripture unto thee only that thou mayst explain unto them that wherein they differ and as a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
Allah sendeth down water from the sky and therewith reviveth the earth after her death
Lo herein is indeed a portent for a folk who hear
And lo in the cattle there is a lesson for you
We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from betwixt the refuse and the blood pure milk palatable to the drinkers
And of the fruits of the datepalm and grapes whence ye derive strong drink and also good nourishment
Lo therein is indeed a portent for people who have sense
And thy Lord inspired the bee saying Choose thou habitations in the hills and in the trees and in that which they thatch
Then eat of all fruits and follow the ways of thy Lord made smooth for thee
There cometh forth from their bellies a drink divers of hues wherein is healing for mankind
Lo herein is indeed a portent for people who reflect
And Allah createth you then causeth you to die and among you is he who is brought back to the most abject stage of life so that he knoweth nothing after having had knowledge Lo
Allah is Knower Powerful
And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision
Now those who are more favoured will by no means hand over their provision to those slaves whom their right hands possess so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof
Is it then the grace of Allah that they deny
And Allah hath given you wives of your own kind and hath given you from your wives sons and grandsons and hath made provision of good things for you
Is it then in vanity that they believe and in the grace of Allah that they disbelieve
And they worship beside Allah that which owneth no provision whatsoever for them from the heavens or the earth nor have they whom they worship any power
So coin not similitudes for Allah
Lo Allah knoweth ye know not
Allah coineth a similitude on the one hand a mere chattel slave who hath control of nothing and on the other hand one on whom we have bestowed a fair provision from Us and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly
Are they equal
Praise be to Allah But most of them know not
And Allah coineth a similitude Two men one of them dumb having control of nothing and he is a burden on his owner whithersoever he directeth him to go he bringeth no good
Is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth a straight path of conduct
And unto Allah belongeth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth and the matter of the Hour of Doom is but as a twinkling of the eye or it is nearer still Lo
Allah is Able to do all things
And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers knowing nothing and gave you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye might give thanks
Have they not seen the birds obedient in midair
None holdeth them save Allah
Lo herein verily are portents for a people who believe
And Allah hath given you in your houses an abode and hath given you also of the hides of cattle houses which ye find light to carry on the day of migration and on the day of pitching camp and of their wool and their fur and their hair caparison and comfort for a while
And Allah hath given you of that which He hath created shelter from the sun and hath given you places of refuge in the mountains and hath given you coats to ward off the heat from you and coats of armour to save you from your own foolhardiness
Thus doth He perfect His favour unto you in order that ye may surrender unto Him
Then if they turn away thy duty O Muhammad is but plain conveyance of the message
They know the favour of Allah and then deny it
Most of them are ingrates
And bethink you of the day when we raise up of every nation a witness then there is no leave for disbelievers nor are they allowed to make amends
And when those who did wrong behold the doom it will not be made light for them nor will they be reprieved
And when those who ascribed partners to Allah behold those partners of theirs they will say Our Lord these are our partners unto whom we used to cry instead of Thee
But they will fling to them the saying Lo ye verily are liars
And they proffer unto Allah submission on that day and all that they used to invent hath failed them
For those who disbelieve and debar men from the way of Allah We add doom to doom because they wrought corruption
And bethink you of the day when We raise in every nation a witness against them of their own folk and We bring thee Muhammad as a witness against these
And We reveal the Scripture unto thee as an exposition of all things and a guidance and a mercy and good tidings for those who have surrendered to Allah
Lo Allah enjoineth justice and kindness and giving to kinsfolk and forbiddeth lewdness and abomination and wickedness
He exhorteth you in order that ye may take heed
Fulfil the covenant of Allah when ye have covenanted and break not your oaths after the asseveration of them and after ye have made Allah surety over you Lo
Allah knoweth what ye do
And be not like unto her who unravelleth the thread after she hath made it strong to thin filaments making your oaths a deceit between you because of a nation being more numerous than another nation
Allah only trieth you thereby and He verily will explain to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein ye differed
Had Allah willed He could have made you all one nation but He sendeth whom He will astray and guideth whom He will and ye will indeed be asked of what ye used to do
Make not your oaths a deceit between you lest a foot should slip after being firmly planted and ye should taste evil forasmuch as ye debarred men from the way of Allah and yours should be an awful doom
And purchase not a small gain at the price of Allah s covenant
Lo that which Allah hath is better for you if ye did but know
That which ye have wasteth away and that which Allah hath remaineth
And verily We shall pay those who are steadfast a recompense in proportion to the best of what they used to do
Whosoever doeth right whether male or female and is a believer him verily we shall quicken with good life and We shall pay them a recompense in proportion to the best of what they used to do
And when thou recitest the Qur an seek refuge in Allah from Satan the outcast
Lo he hath no power over those who believe and put trust in their Lord
His power is only over those who make a friend of him and those who ascribe partners unto Him Allah
And when We put a revelation in place of another revelation and Allah knoweth best what He revealeth they say Lo thou art but inventing
Most of them know not
Say The holy Spirit hath delivered it from thy Lord with truth that it may confirm the faith of those who believe and as guidance and good tidings for those who have surrendered to Allah
And We know well that they say Only a man teacheth him
The speech of him at whom they falsely hint is outlandish and this is clear Arabic speech
Lo those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah Allah guideth them not and theirs will be a painful doom
Only they invent falsehood who believe not Allah s revelations and only they are the liars
Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief save him who is forced thereto and whose heart is still content with the Faith but whoso findeth ease in disbelief On them is wrath from Allah
Theirs will be an awful doom
That is because they have chosen the life of the world rather than the Hereafter and because Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk
Such are they whose hearts and ears and eyes Allah hath sealed
And such are the heedless
Assuredly in the Hereafter they are the losers
Then lo thy Lord for those who became fugitives after they had been persecuted and then fought and were steadfast lo thy Lord afterward is for them indeed Forgiving Merciful
On the Day when every soul will come pleading for itself and every soul will be repaid what it did and they will not be wronged
Allah coineth a similitude a township that dwelt secure and well content its provision coming to it in abundance from every side but it disbelieved in Allah s favours so Allah made it experience the garb of dearth and fear because of what they used to do
And verily there had come unto them a messenger from among them but they had denied him and so the torment seized them while they were wrongdoers
So eat of the lawful and good food which Allah hath provided for you and thank the bounty of your Lord if it is Him ye serve
He hath forbidden for you only carrion and blood and swineflesh and that which hath been immolated in the name of any other than Allah but he who is driven thereto neither craving nor transgressing lo then Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And speak not concerning that which your own tongues qualify as clean or unclean the falsehood This is lawful and this is forbidden so that ye invent a lie against Allah
Lo those who invent a lie against Allah will not succeed
A brief enjoyment will be theirs and theirs a painful doom
And unto those who are Jews We have forbidden that which We have already related unto thee
And We wronged them not but they were wont to wrong themselves
Then lo thy Lord for those who do evil in ignorance and afterward repent and amend lo for them thy Lord is afterward indeed Forgiving Merciful
Lo Abraham was a nation obedient to Allah by nature upright and he was not of the idolaters
Thankful for His bounties He chose him and He guided him unto a straight path
And We gave him good in the world and in the Hereafter he is among the righteous
And afterward We inspired thee Muhammad saying Follow the religion of Abraham as one by nature upright
He was not of the idolaters
The Sabbath was appointed only for those who differed concerning it and lo thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
Call unto the way of thy Lord with wisdom and fair exhortation and reason with them in the better way
Lo thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way and He is Best Aware of those who go aright
If ye punish then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted
But if ye endure patiently verily it is better for the patient
Endure thou patiently O Muhammad
Thine endurance is only by the help of Allah
Grieve not for them and be not in distress because of that which they devise
Lo Allah is with those who keep their duty unto Him and those who are doers of good
Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from the Inviolable Place of Worship to the Far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed that We might show him of Our tokens Lo
He only He is the Hearer the Seer
We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We appointed it a guidance for the children of Israel saying Choose no guardian beside Me
They were the seed of those whom We carried in the ship along with Noah
Lo he was a grateful slave
And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture Ye verily will work corruption in the earth twice and ye will become great tyrants
So when the time for the first of the two came We roused against you slaves of Ours of great might who ravaged your country and it was a threat performed
Then we gave you once again your turn against them and We aided you with wealth and children and made you more in soldiery
Saying If ye do good ye do good for your own souls and if ye do evil it is for them in like manner
So when the time for the second of the judgments came We roused against you others of Our slaves to ravage you and to enter the Temple even as they entered it the first time and to lay waste all that they conquered with an utter wasting
It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you but if ye repeat the crime We shall repeat the punishment and We have appointed hell a dungeon for the disbelievers
Lo this Qur an guideth unto that which is straightest and giveth tidings unto the believers who do good works that theirs will be a great reward
And that those who believe not in the Hereafter for them We have prepared a painful doom
Man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good for man was ever hasty
And We appoint the night and the day two portents
Then We make dark the portent of the night and We make the portent of the day sightgiving that ye may seek bounty from your Lord and that ye may know the computation of the years and the reckoning and everything have We expounded with a clear expounding
And every man s augury have We fastened to his own neck and We shall bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open
And it will be said unto him Read thy Book
Thy soul sufficeth as reckoner against thee this day
Whosoever goeth right it is only for the good of his own soul that he goeth right and whosoever erreth erreth only to its hurt
No laden soul can bear another s load We never punish until we have sent a messenger
And when We would destroy a township We send commandment to its folk who live at ease and afterward they commit abomination therein and so the Word of doom hath effect for it and we annihilate it with complete annihilation
How many generations have We destroyed since Noah
And Allah sufficeth as Knower and Beholder of the sins of His slaves
Whoso desireth that life which hasteneth away We hasten for him therein what We will for whom We please
And afterward We have appointed for him hell he will endure the heat thereof condemned rejected
And whoso desireth the Hereafter and striveth for it with the effort necessary being a believer for such their effort findeth favour with their Lord
Each do We supply both these and those from the bounty of thy Lord
And the bounty of thy Lord can never be walled up
See how We prefer one of them above another and verily the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment
Set not up with Allah any other god O man lest thou sit down reproved forsaken
Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none save Him and that ye show kindness to parents
If one of them or both of them attain old age with thee say not Fie unto them nor repulse them but speak unto them a gracious word
And lower unto them the wing of submission through mercy and say My Lord
Have mercy on them both as they did care for me when I was little
Your Lord is Best Aware of what is in your minds
If ye are righteous then lo He was ever Forgiving unto those who turn unto Him
Give the kinsman his due and the needy and the wayfarer and squander not thy wealth in wantonness
Lo the squanderers were ever brothers of the devils and the devil was ever an ingrate to his Lord
But if thou turn away from them seeking mercy from thy Lord for which thou hopest then speak unto them a reasonable word
And let not thy hand be chained to thy neck nor open it with a complete opening lest thou sit down rebuked denuded
Lo thy Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will and straiteneth it for whom He will
Lo He was ever Knower Seer of His slaves
Slay not your children fearing a fall to poverty We shall provide for them and for you
Lo the slaying of them is great sin
And come not near unto adultery
Lo it is an abomination and an evil way
And slay not the life which Allah hath forbidden save with right
Whoso is slain wrongfully We have given power unto his heir but let him not commit excess in slaying
Lo he will be helped
Come not near the wealth of the orphan save with that which is better till he come to strength and keep the covenant
Lo of the covenant it will be asked
Fill the measure when ye measure and weigh with a right balance that is meet and better in the end
O man follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge
Lo the hearing and the sight and the heart of each of these it will be asked
And walk not in the earth exultant
Lo thou canst not rend the earth nor canst thou stretch to the height of the hills
The evil of all that is hateful in the sight of thy Lord
This is part of that wisdom wherewith thy Lord hath inspired thee O Muhammad
And set not up with Allah any other god lest thou be cast into hell reproved abandoned
Hath your Lord then distinguished you O men of Makka by giving you sons and hath chosen for Himself females from among the angels
Lo verily ye speak an awful word
We verily have displayed Our warnings in this Qur an that they may take heed but it increaseth them in naught save aversion
Say O Muhammad to the disbelievers If there were other gods along with Him as they say then had they sought a way against the Lord of the Throne
Glorified is He and High Exalted above what they say
The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein praise Him and there is not a thing but hymneth His praise but ye understand not their praise Lo
He is ever Clement Forgiving
And when thou recitest the Qur an we place between thee and those who believe not in the Hereafter a hidden barrier
And We place upon their hearts veils lest they should understand it and in their ears a deafness and when thou makest mention of thy Lord alone in the Qur an they turn their backs in aversion
We are Best Aware of what they wish to hear when they give ear to thee and when they take secret counsel when the evildoers say Ye follow but a man bewitched
See what similitudes they coin for thee and thus are all astray and cannot find a road
And they say When we are bones and fragments shall we forsooth be raised up as a new creation
Say Be ye stones or iron
Or some created thing that is yet greater in your thoughts
Then they will say Who shall bring us back to life
Say He Who created you at the first
Then will they shake their heads at thee and say When will it be
Say It will perhaps be soon
A day when He will call you and ye will answer with His praise and ye will think that ye have tarried but a little while
Tell My bondmen to speak that which is kindlier
Lo the devil soweth discord among them
Lo the devil is for man an open foe
Your Lord is Best Aware of you
If He will He will have mercy on you or if He will He will punish you
We have not sent thee O Muhammad as a warden over them
And thy Lord is Best Aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth
And we preferred some of the prophets above others and unto David We gave the Psalms
Say Cry unto those saints and angels whom ye assume to be gods beside Him yet they have no power to rid you of misfortune nor to change
Those unto whom they cry seek the way of approach to their Lord which of them shall be the nearest they hope for His mercy and they fear His doom
Lo the doom of thy Lord is to be shunned
There is not a township but We shall destroy it ere the Day of Resurrection or punish it with dire punishment
That is set forth in the Book of Our decrees
Naught hindereth Us from sending portents save that the folk of old denied them
And We gave Thamud the shecamel a clear portent save to warn
And it was a warning when we told thee Lo thy Lord encompasseth mankind and We appointed the sight which We showed thee as an ordeal for mankind and likewise the Accursed Tree in the Qur an
We warn them but it increaseth them in naught save gross impiety
And when We said unto the angels Fall down prostrate before Adam and they fell prostrate all save Iblis he said Shall I fall prostrate before that which Thou hast created of clay
He said Seest Thou this creature whom Thou hast honoured above me if Thou give me grace until the Day of Resurrection I verily will seize his seed save but a few
He said Go and whosoever of them followeth thee lo hell will be your payment ample payment
And excite any of them whom thou canst with thy voice and urge thy horse and foot against them and be a partner in their wealth and children and promise them
Satan promiseth them only to deceive
Lo My faithful bondmen over them thou hast no power and thy Lord sufficeth as their guardian
O mankind your Lord is He Who driveth for you the ship upon the sea that ye may seek of His bounty
Lo He was ever Merciful toward you
And when harm toucheth you upon the sea all unto whom ye cry for succour fail save Him alone but when He bringeth you safe to land ye turn away for man was ever thankless
Feel ye then secure that He will not cause a slope of the land to engulf you or send a sandstorm upon you and then ye will find that ye have no protector
Or feel ye secure that He will not return you to that plight a second time and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you for your thanklessness and then ye will not find therein that ye have any avenger against Us
Verily we have honoured the Children of Adam We carry them on the land and the sea and have made provision of good things for them and have preferred them above many of those whom We created with a marked preferment
On the day when We shall summon all men with their record whoso is given his book in his right hand such will read their book and they will not be wronged a shred
Whoso is blind here will be blind in the Hereafter and yet further from the road
And they indeed strove hard to beguile thee Muhammad away from that wherewith We have inspired thee that thou shouldst invent other than it against Us and then would they have accepted thee as a friend
And if We had not made thee wholly firm thou mightest almost have inclined unto them a little
Then had we made thee taste a double punishment of living and a double punishment of dying then hadst thou found no helper against Us
And they indeed wished to scare thee from the land that they might drive thee forth from thence and then they would have stayed there but a little after thee
Such was Our method in the case of those whom We sent before thee to mankind and thou wilt not find for Our method aught of power to change
Establish worship at the going down of the sun until the dark of night and the recital of the Qur an at dawn
Lo the recital of the Qur an at dawn is ever witnessed
And some part of the night awake for it a largess for thee
It may be that thy Lord will raise thee to a praised estate
And say My Lord
Cause me to come in with a firm incoming and to go out with a firm outgoing
And give me from Thy presence a sustaining Power
And say Truth hath come and falsehood hath vanished away
Lo falsehood is ever bound to vanish
And We reveal of the Qur an that which is a healing and a mercy for believers though it increase the evildoers in naught save ruin
And when We make life pleasant unto man he turneth away and is averse and when ill toucheth him he is in despair
Say Each one doth according to his rule of conduct and thy Lord is Best Aware of him whose way is right
They are asking thee concerning the Spirit
Say The Spirit is by command of my Lord and of knowledge ye have been vouchsafed but little
And if We willed We could withdraw that which We have revealed unto thee then wouldst thou find no guardian for thee against Us in respect thereof
It is naught save mercy from thy Lord Lo
His kindness unto thee was ever great
Say Verily though mankind and the jinn should assemble to produce the like of this Qur an they could not produce the like thereof though they were helpers one of another
And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Qur an all kind of similitudes but most of mankind refuse aught save disbelief
And they say We will not put faith in thee till thou cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us
Or thou have a garden of datepalms and grapes and cause rivers to gush forth therein abundantly
Or thou cause the heaven to fall upon us piecemeal as thou hast pretended or bring Allah and the angels as a warrant
Or thou have a house of gold or thou ascend up into heaven and even then we will put no faith in thine ascension till thou bring down for us a book that we can read
Say O Muhammad My Lord be Glorified
Am I aught save a mortal messenger
And naught prevented mankind from believing when the guidance came unto them save that they said Hath Allah sent a mortal as His messenger
Say If there were in the earth angels walking secure We had sent down for them from heaven an angel as messenger
Say Allah sufficeth for a witness between me and you
Lo He is Knower Seer of His slaves
And he whom Allah guideth he is led aright while as for him whom He sendeth astray for them thou wilt find no protecting friends beside Him and We shall assemble them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces blind dumb and deaf their habitation will be hell whenever it abateth We increase the flame for them
That is their reward because they disbelieved Our revelations and said When we are bones and fragments shall we forsooth be raised up as a new creation
Have they not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is Able to create the like of them and hath appointed for them an end whereof there is no doubt
But the wrongdoers refuse aught save disbelief
Say unto them If ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord ye would surely hold them back for fear of spending for man was ever grudging
And verily We gave unto Moses nine tokens clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty
Do but ask the Children of Israel how he came unto them then Pharaoh said unto him Lo
I deem thee one bewitched O Moses
He said In truth thou knowest that none sent down these portents save the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs and lo for my part I deem thee lost O Pharaoh
And he wished to scare them from the land but We drowned him and those with him all together
And We said unto the Children of Israel after him Dwell in the land but when the promise of the Hereafter cometh to pass We shall bring you as a crowd gathered out of various nations
With truth have We sent it down and with truth hath it descended
And We have sent thee as naught else save a bearer of good tidings and a warner
And it is a Qur an that We have divided that thou mayst recite it unto mankind at intervals and We have revealed it by successive revelation
Say Believe therein or believe not lo those who were given knowledge before it when it is read unto them fall down prostrate on their faces adoring
Saying Glory to our Lord
Verily the promise of our Lord must be fulfilled
They fall down on their faces weeping and it increaseth humility in them
Say unto mankind Cry unto Allah or cry unto the Beneficent unto whichsoever ye cry it is the same
His are the most beautiful names
And thou Muhammad be not loudvoiced in thy worship nor yet silent therein but follow a way between
And say Praise be to Allah Who hath not taken unto Himself a son and Who hath no partner in the Sovereignty nor hath He any protecting friend through dependence
And magnify Him with all magnificence
Praise be to Allah Who hath revealed the Scripture unto His slave and hath not placed therein any crookedness
But hath made it straight to give warning of stern punishment from Him and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be a fair reward
Wherein they will abide for ever
And to warn those who say Allah hath chosen a son
A thing whereof they have no knowledge nor had their fathers Dreadful is the word that cometh out of their mouths
They speak naught but a lie
Yet it may be if they believe not in this statement that thou Muhammad wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps
Lo We have placed all that is on the earth as an ornament thereof that We may try them which of them is best in conduct
And lo We shall make all that is thereon a barren mound
Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription are a wonder among Our portents
When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave and said Our Lord
Give us mercy from Thy presence and shape for us right conduct in our plight
Then We sealed up their hearing in the Cave for a number of years
And afterward We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties would best calculate the time that they had tarried
We narrate unto thee their story with truth
Lo they were young men who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance
And We made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth
We cry unto no Allah beside Him for then should we utter an enormity
These our people have chosen other gods beside Him though they bring no clear warrant vouchsafed to them
And who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah
And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah then seek refuge in the Cave your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will prepare for you a pillow in your plight
And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right and when it set go past them on the left and they were in the cleft thereof
That was one of the portents of Allah
He whom Allah guideth he indeed is led aright and he whom He sendeth astray for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend
And thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep and We caused them to turn over to the right and the left and their dog stretching out his paws on the threshold
If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight and hadst been filled with awe of them
And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another
A speaker from among them said How long have ye tarried
They said We have tarried a day or some part of a day Others said Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried
Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city and let him see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof
Let him be courteous and let no man know of you
For they if they should come to know of you will stone you or turn you back to their religion then ye will never prosper
And in like manner We disclosed them to the people of the city that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that as for the Hour there is no doubt concerning it
When the people of the city disputed of their case among themselves they said Build over them a building their Lord knoweth best concerning them
Those who won their point said We verily shall build a place of worship over them
Some will say They were three their dog the fourth and some say Five their dog the sixth guessing at random and some say Seven and their dog the eighth
Say O Muhammad My Lord is Best Aware of their number
None knoweth them save a few
So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them
And say not of anything Lo I shall do that tomorrow
Except if Allah will
And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest and say It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this
And it is said they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine
Say Allah is Best Aware how long they tarried
His is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth
How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing
They have no protecting friend beside Him and He maketh none to share in His government
And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord
There is none who can change His words and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him
Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and evening seeking His Countenance and let not thine eyes overlook them desiring the pomp of the life of the world and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been abandoned
Say It is the truth from the Lord of you all
Then whosoever will let him believe and whosoever will let him disbelieve Lo
We have prepared for disbelievers Fire Its tent encloseth them
If they ask for showers they will be showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces
Calamitous the drink and ill the restingplace
Lo as for those who believe and do good works Lo We suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost
As for such theirs will be Gardens of Eden wherein rivers flow beneath them therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery reclining upon throne therein
Blest the reward and fair the restingplace
Coin for them a similitude Two men unto one of whom We had assigned two gardens of grapes and We had surrounded both with datepalms and had put between them tillage
Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof
And We caused a river to gush forth therein
And he had fruit
And he said unto his comrade when he spake with him I am more than thee in wealth and stronger in respect of men
And he went into his garden while he thus wronged himself He said I think not that all this will ever perish
I think not that the Hour will ever come and if indeed I am brought back unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort
His comrade when he thus spake with him exclaimed Disbelievest thou in Him Who created thee of dust then of a drop of seed and then fashioned thee a man
But He is Allah my Lord and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner
If only when thou enteredst thy garden thou hadst said That which Allah willeth will come to pass
There is no strength save in Allah
Though thou seest me as less than thee in wealth and children
Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden and will send on it a bolt from heaven and some morning it will be a smooth hillside
Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst not make search for it
And his fruit was beset with destruction
Then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent upon it when now it was all ruined on its trellises and to say Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord
And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah nor could he save himself
In this case is protection only from Allah the True He is Best for reward and best for consequence
And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter
Allah is able to do all things
Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world
But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord s sight for reward and better in respect of hope
And bethink you of the Day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth emerging and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind
And they are set before thy Lord in ranks and it is said unto them Now verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first
But ye thought that We had set no tryst for you
And the Book is placed and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is therein and they say What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a great thing but hath counted it And they find all that they did confronting them and thy Lord wrongeth noone
And remember when We said unto the angels Fall prostrate before Adam and they fell prostrate all save Iblis
He was of the jinn so he rebelled against his Lord s command
Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead of Me when they are an enemy unto you
Calamitous is the exchange for evildoers
I made them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth nor their own creation nor choose I misleaders for My helpers
And be mindful of the Day when He will say Call those partners of Mine whom ye pretended
Then they will cry unto them but they will not hear their prayer and We shall set a gulf of doom between them
And the guilty behold the Fire and know that they are about to fall therein and they find no way of escape thence
And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Qur an all manner of similitudes but man is more than anything contentious
And naught hindereth mankind from believing when the guidance cometh unto them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord unless it be that they wish that the judgment of the men of old should come upon them or that they should be confronted with the Doom
We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners
Those who disbelieve contend with falsehood in order to refute the Truth thereby
And they take Our revelations and that wherewith they are threatened as a jest
And who doth greater wrong than he who hath been reminded of the revelations of his Lord yet turneth away from them and forgetteth what his hands send forward to the Judgment
Lo on their hearts We have placed coverings so that they understand not and in their ears a deafness
And though thou call them to the guidance in that case they can never be led aright
Thy Lord is the Forgiver Full of Mercy
If He took them to task now for what they earn He would hasten on the doom for them but theirs is an appointed term from which they will find no escape
And all those townships We destroyed them when they did wrong and We appointed a fixed time for their destruction
And when Moses said unto his servant I will not give up until I reach the point where the two rivers meet though I march on for ages
And when they reached the point where the two met they forgot their fish and it took its way into the waters being free
And when they had gone further he said unto his servant Bring us our breakfast
Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey
He said Didst thou see when we took refuge on the rock and I forgot the fish and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it it took its way into the waters by a marvel
He said This is that which we have been seeking
So they retraced their steps again
Then found they one of Our slaves unto whom We had given mercy from Us and had taught him knowledge from Our presence
Moses said unto him May I follow thee to the end that thou mayst teach me right conduct of that which thou hast been taught
He said Lo thou canst not bear with me
How canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any knowledge
He said Allah willing thou shalt find me patient and I shall not in aught gainsay thee
He said Well if thou go with me ask me not concerning aught till I myself make mention of it unto thee
So they twain set out till when they were in the ship he made a hole therein
Moses said Hast thou made a hole therein to drown the folk thereof
Thou verily hast done a dreadful thing
He said Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me
Moses said Be not wroth with me that I forgot and be not hard upon me for my fault
So they twain journeyed on till when they met a lad he slew him Moses said What
Hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man
Verily thou hast done a horrid thing
He said Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me
Moses said If I ask thee after this concerning aught keep not company with me
Thou hast received an excuse from me
So they twain journeyed on till when they came unto the folk of a certain township they asked its folk for food but they refused to make them guests
And they found therein a wall upon the point of falling into ruin and he repaired it
Moses said If thou hadst wished thou couldst have taken payment for it
He said This is the parting between thee and me
I will announce unto thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience
As for the ship it belonged to poor people working on the river and I wished to mar it for there was a king behind them who is taking every ship by force
And as for the lad his parents were believers and we feared lest he should oppress them by rebellion and disbelief
And we intended that their Lord should change him for them for one better in purity and nearer to mercy
And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them and their father had been righteous and thy Lord intended that they should come to their full strength and should bring forth their treasure as a mercy from their Lord and I did it not upon my own command Such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear
They will ask thee of Dhu lQarneyn
Say I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him
Lo We made him strong in the land and gave him unto every thing a road
And he followed a road
Till when he reached the settingplace of the sun he found it setting in a muddy spring and found a people thereabout
We said O Dhu lQarneyn
Either punish or show them kindness
He said As for him who doeth wrong we shall punish him and then he will be brought back unto his Lord Who will punish him with awful punishment
But as for him who believeth and doeth right good will be his reward and We shall speak unto him a mild command
Then he followed a road
Till when he reached the risingplace of the sun he found it rising on a people for whom We had appointed no shelter therefrom
So it was
And We knew all concerning him
Then he followed a road
Till when he came between the two mountains he found upon their hither side a folk that scarce could understand a saying
They said O Dhu lQarneyn
Lo Gog and Magog are spoiling the land
So may we pay thee tribute on condition that thou set a barrier between us and them
He said That wherein my Lord hath established me is better than your tribute
Do but help me with strength of men I will set between you and them a bank
Give me pieces of iron till when he had levelled up the gap between the cliffs he said Blow till when he had made it a fire he said Bring me molten copper to pour thereon
And Gog and Magog were not able to surmount nor could they pierce it
He said This is a mercy from my Lord but when the promise of my Lord cometh to pass He will lay it low for the promise of my Lord is true
And on that day we shall let some of them surge against others and the Trumpet will be blown
Then We shall gather them together in one gathering
On that day we shall present hell to the disbelievers plain to view
Those whose eyes were hoodwinked from My reminder and who could not bear to hear
Do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose My bondmen as protecting friends beside Me
Lo We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers
Say Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works
Those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world and yet they reckon that they do good work
Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord and in the meeting with Him
Therefor their works are vain and on the Day of Resurrection We assign no weight to them
That is their reward hell because they disbelieved and made a jest of Our revelations and Our messengers
Lo those who believe and do good works theirs are the Gardens of Paradise for welcome
Wherein they will abide with no desire to be removed from thence
Say Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord verily the sea would be used up before the words of my Lord were exhausted even though We brought the like thereof to help
Say I am only a mortal like you
My Lord inspireth in me that your Allah is only One Allah
And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord let him do righteous work and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord

A mention of the mercy of thy Lord unto His servant Zachariah
When he cried unto his Lord a cry in secret
Saying My Lord
Lo the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey hair and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee my Lord
Lo I fear my kinsfolk after me since my wife is barren
Oh give me from Thy presence a successor
Who shall inherit of me and inherit also of the house of Jacob
And make him my Lord acceptable unto Thee
It was said unto him O Zachariah
Lo We bring thee tidings of a son whose name is John we have given the same name to none before him
He said My Lord
How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached infirm old age
He said So it will be Thy Lord saith It is easy for Me even as I created thee before when thou wast naught
He said My Lord
Appoint for me some token
He said Thy token is that thou with no bodily defect shalt not speak unto mankind three nights
Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary and signified to them Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night
And it was said unto his son O John
Hold fast the Scripture
And we gave him wisdom when a child
And compassion from Our presence and purity and he was devout
And dutiful toward his parents And he was not arrogant rebellious
Peace on him the day he was born and the day he dieth and the day he shall be raised alive
And make mention of Mary in the Scripture when she had withdrawn from her people to a chamber looking East
And had chosen seclusion from them
Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man
She said Lo I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee if thou art Allahfearing
He said I am only a messenger of thy Lord that I may bestow on thee a faultless son
She said How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me neither have I been unchaste
He said So it will be Thy Lord saith It is easy for Me
And it will be that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us and it is a thing ordained
And she conceived him and she withdrew with him to a far place
And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palmtree
She said Oh would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught forgotten
Then one cried unto her from below her saying Grieve not Thy Lord hath placed a rivulet beneath thee
And shake the trunk of the palmtree toward thee thou wilt cause ripe dates to fall upon thee
So eat and drink and be consoled
And if thou meetest any mortal say Lo I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent and may not speak this day to any mortal
Then she brought him to her own folk carrying him
They said O Mary
Thou hast come with an amazing thing
O sister of Aaron
Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot
Then she pointed to him
They said How can we talk to one who is in the cradle a young boy
He spake Lo I am the slave of Allah
He hath given me the Scripture and hath appointed me a Prophet
And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be and hath enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive
And hath made me dutiful toward her who bore me and hath not made me arrogant unblest
Peace on me the day I was born and the day I die and the day I shall be raised alive
Such was Jesus son of Mary this is a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt
It befitteth not the Majesty of Allah that He should take unto Himself a son
Glory be to Him
When He decreeth a thing He saith unto it only Be and it is
And lo Allah is my Lord and your Lord
So serve Him
That is the right path
The sects among them differ but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of an awful Day
See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us yet the evildoers are today in error manifest
And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided
Now they are in a state of carelessness and they believe not
Lo We only We inherit the earth and all who are thereon and unto Us they are returned
And make mention O Muhammad in the Scripture of Abraham
Lo he was a saint a prophet
When he said unto his father O my father
Why worshippest thou that which heareth not nor seeth nor can in aught avail thee
O my father
Lo there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came not unto thee
So follow me and I will lead thee on a right path
O my father
Serve not the devil
Lo the devil is a rebel unto the Beneficent
O my father
Lo I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee so that thou become a comrade of the devil
He said Rejectest thou my gods O Abraham
If thou cease not I shall surely stone thee
Depart from me a long while
He said Peace be unto thee
I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee
Lo He was ever gracious unto me
I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside Allah and I shall pray unto my Lord
It may be that in prayer unto my Lord I shall not be unblest
So when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were worshipping beside Allah We gave him Isaac and Jacob
Each of them We made a prophet
And we gave them of Our mercy and assigned to them a high and true renown
And make mention in the Scripture of Moses
Lo he was chosen and he was a messenger of Allah a prophet
We called him from the right slope of the Mount and brought him nigh in communion
And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron a prophet likewise
And make mention in the Scripture of Ishmael
Lo he was a keeper of his promise and he was a messenger of Allah a prophet
He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving and was acceptable in the sight of his Lord
And make mention in the Scripture of Idris
Lo he was a saint a prophet
And We raised him to high station
These are they unto whom Allah showed favour from among the prophets of the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried in the ship with Noah and of the seed of Abraham and Israel and from among those whom We guided and chose
When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them they fell down adoring and weeping
Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined worship and have followed lusts
But they will meet deception
Save him who shall repent and believe and do right
Such will enter the Garden and they will not be wronged in aught
Gardens of Eden which the Beneficent hath promised to His slaves in the unseen Lo
His promise is ever sure of fulfilment
They hear therein no idle talk but only Peace and therein they have food for morn and evening
Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to inherit
We angels come not down save by commandment of thy Lord
Unto Him belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those two and thy Lord was never forgetful
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
Therefor worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service
Knowest thou one that can be named along with Him
And man saith When I am dead shall I forsooth be brought forth alive
Doth not man remember that We created him before when he was naught
And by thy Lord verily We shall assemble them and the devils then We shall bring them crouching around hell
Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most stubborn in rebellion to the Beneficent
And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein
There is not one of you but shall approach it
That is a fixed ordinance of thy Lord
Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil and leave the evildoers crouching there
And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them those who disbelieve say unto those who believe Which of the two parties yours or ours is better in position and more imposing as an army
How many a generation have We destroyed before them who were more imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming
Say As for him who is in error the Beneficent will verily prolong his span of life until when they behold that which they were promised whether it be punishment in the world or the Hour of doom they will know who is worse in position and who is weaker as an army
Allah increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright and the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord s sight for reward and better for resort
Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith Assuredly I shall be given wealth and children
Hath he perused the Unseen or hath he made a pact with the Beneficent
Nay but We shall record that which he saith and prolong for him a span of torment
And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake and he will come unto Us alone without his wealth and children
And they have chosen other gods beside Allah that they may be a power for them
Nay but they will deny their worship of them and become opponents unto them
Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion
So make no haste against them O Muhammad
We do but number unto them a sum of days
On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent a goodly company
And drive the guilty unto hell a weary herd
They will have no power of intercession save him who hath made a covenant with his Lord
And they say The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son
Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing
Whereby almost the heavens are torn and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins
That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son
When it is not meet for the Majesty of the Beneficent that He should choose a son
There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave
Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with right numbering
And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection alone
Lo those who believe and do good works the Beneficent will appoint for them love
And We make this Scripture easy in thy tongue O Muhammad only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off evil and warn therewith the froward folk
And how many a generation before them have We destroyed
Canst thou Muhammad see a single man of them or hear from them the slightest sound
Ta
Ha
We have not revealed unto thee Muhammad this Qur an that thou shouldst be distressed
But as a reminder unto him who feareth
A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens
The Beneficent One Who is established on the Throne
Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth and whatsoever is between them and whatsoever is beneath the sod
And if thou speakest aloud then lo
He knoweth the secret thought and that which is yet more hidden
Allah
There is no Allah save Him
His are the most beautiful names
Hath there come unto thee the story of Moses
When he saw a fire and said unto his folk Lo Wait
I see a fire afar off
Peradventure I may bring you a brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire
And when he reached it he was called by name O Moses
Lo
I even I am thy Lord So take off thy shoes for lo thou art in the holy valley of Tuwa
And I have chosen thee so hearken unto that which is inspired
Lo
I even I am Allah There is no Allah save Me
So serve Me and establish worship for My remembrance
Lo the Hour is surely coming
But I will to keep it hidden that every soul may be rewarded for that which it striveth to achieve
Therefor let not him turn thee aside from the thought of it who believeth not therein but followeth his own desire lest thou perish
And what is that in thy right hand O Moses
He said This is my staff whereon I lean and wherewith I bear down branches for my sheep and wherein I find other uses
He said Cast it down O Moses
So he cast it down and lo it was a serpent gliding
He said Grasp it and fear not
We shall return it to its former state
And thrust thy hand within thine armpit it will come forth white without hurt That will be another token
That We may show thee some of Our greater portents
Go thou unto Pharaoh
Lo he hath transgressed the bounds
Moses said My Lord relieve my mind
And ease my task for me
And loose a knot from my tongue
That they may understand my saying
Appoint for me a henchman from my folk
Aaron my brother
Confirm my strength with him
And let him share my task
That we may glorify Thee much
And much remember Thee
Lo Thou art ever Seeing us
He said Thou art granted thy request O Moses
And indeed another time already We have shown thee favour
When we inspired in thy mother that which is inspired
Saying Throw him into the ark and throw it into the river then the river shall throw it on to the bank and there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him shall take him
And I endued thee with love from Me that thou mightest be trained according to My will
When thy sister went and said Shall I show you one who will nurse him and we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not sorrow
And thou didst kill a man and We delivered thee from great distress and tried thee with a heavy trial
And thou didst tarry years among the folk of Midian
Then camest thou hither by My providence O Moses
And I have attached thee to Myself
Go thou and thy brother with My tokens and be not faint in remembrance of Me
Go both of you unto Pharaoh
Lo he hath transgressed the bounds
And speak unto him a gentle word that peradventure he may heed or fear
They said Our Lord
Lo we fear that he may be beforehand with us or that he may play the tyrant
Lo I am with you twain Hearing and Seeing
So go ye unto him and say Lo we are two messengers of thy Lord
So let the children of Israel go with us and torment them not
We bring thee a token from thy Lord
And peace will be for him who followeth right guidance
Lo it hath been revealed unto us that the doom will be for him who denieth and turneth away
Pharaoh said Who then is the Lord of you twain O Moses
He said Our Lord is He Who gave unto everything its nature then guided it aright
He said What then is the state of the generations of old
He said The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a Record
My Lord neither erreth nor forgetteth
Who hath appointed the earth as a bed and hath threaded roads for you therein and hath sent down water from the sky and thereby We have brought forth divers kinds of vegetation
Saying Eat ye and feed your cattle
Lo herein verily are portents for men of thought
Thereof We created you and thereunto We return you and thence We bring you forth a second time
And We verily did show him all Our tokens but he denied them and refused
He said Hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic O Moses
But we surely can produce for thee magic the like thereof so appoint a tryst between us and you which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep at a place convenient to us both
Moses said Your tryst shall be the day of the feast and let the people assemble when the sun hath risen high
Then Pharaoh went and gathered his strength then came to the appointed tryst
Moses said unto them Woe unto you
Invent not a lie against Allah lest He extirpate you by some punishment
He who lieth faileth miserably
Then they debated one with another what they must do and they kept their counsel secret
They said Lo these are two wizards who would drive you out from your country by their magic and destroy your best traditions
So arrange your plan and come in battle line
Whoso is uppermost this day will be indeed successful
They said O Moses
Either throw first or let us be the first to throw
He said Nay do ye throw
Then lo their cords and their staves by their magic appeared to him as though they ran
And Moses conceived a fear in his mind
We said Fear not Lo thou art the higher
Throw that which is in thy right hand
It will eat up that which they have made
Lo that which they have made is but a wizard s artifice and a wizard shall not be successful to whatever point of skill he may attain
Then the wizards were all flung down prostrate crying We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses
Pharaoh said Ye put faith in him before I give you leave
Lo he is your chief who taught you magic
Now surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately and I shall crucify you on the trunks of palm trees and ye shall know for certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment
They said We choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto us and above Him Who created us
So decree what thou wilt decree
Thou wilt end for us only this life of the world
Lo we believe in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and the magic unto which thou didst force us
Allah is better and more lasting
Lo whoso cometh guilty unto his Lord verily for him is hell
There he will neither die nor live
But whoso cometh unto Him a believer having done good works for such are the high stations
Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide for ever
That is the reward of him who groweth
And verily We inspired Moses saying Take away My slaves by night and strike for them a dry path in the sea fearing not to be overtaken neither being afraid of the sea
Then Pharaoh followed them with his hosts and there covered them that which did cover them of the sea
And Pharaoh led his folk astray he did not guide them
O Children of Israel
We delivered you from your enemy and we made a covenant with you on the holy mountain s side and sent down on you the manna and the quails
Saying Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you and transgress not in respect thereof lest My wrath come upon you and he on whom My wrath cometh he is lost indeed
And lo verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and doeth good and afterward walketh aright
And it was said What hath made thee hasten from thy folk O Moses
He said They are close upon my track
I hastened unto Thee my Lord that Thou mightest be well pleased
He said Lo We have tried thy folk in thine absence and AsSamiri hath misled them
Then Moses went back unto his folk angry and sad He said O my people
Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise
Did the time appointed then appear too long for you or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you that ye broke tryst with me
They said We broke not tryst with thee of our own will but we were laden with burdens of ornaments of the folk then cast them in the fire for thus AsSamiri proposed
Then he produced for them a calf of saffron hue which gave forth a lowing sound
And they cried This is your god and the god of Moses but he hath forgotten
See they not then that it returneth no saying unto them and possesseth for them neither hurt nor use
And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand O my people
Ye are but being seduced therewith for lo your Lord is the Beneficent so follow me and obey my order
They said We shall by no means cease to be its votaries till Moses return unto us
He Moses said O Aaron
What held thee back when thou didst see them gone astray
That thou followedst me not
Hast thou then disobeyed my order
He said O son of my mother
Clutch not my beard nor my head
I feared lest thou shouldst say Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel and hast not waited for my word
Moses said And what hast thou to say O Samiri
He said I perceived what they perceive not so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger and then threw it in
Thus my soul commended to me
Moses said Then go and lo in this life it is for thee to say Touch me not and lo there is for thee a tryst thou canst not break
Now look upon thy god of which thou hast remained a votary
Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea
Your Allah is only Allah than Whom there is no other Allah
He embraceth all things in His knowledge
Thus relate We unto thee Muhammad some tidings of that which happened of old and We have given thee from Our presence a reminder
Whoso turneth away from it he verily will bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection
Abiding under it an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection
The day when the Trumpet is blown On that day we assemble the guilty whiteeyed with terror
Murmuring among themselves Ye have tarried but ten days
We are Best Aware of what they utter when their best in conduct say Ye have tarried but a day
They will ask thee of the mountains on that day
Say My Lord will break them into scattered dust
And leave it as an empty plain
Wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness
On that day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not and voices are hushed for the Beneficent and thou hearest but a faint murmur
On that day no intercession availeth save that of him unto whom the Beneficent hath given leave and whose word He accepteth
He knoweth all that is before them and all that is behind them while they cannot compass it in knowledge
And faces humble themselves before the Living the Eternal And he who beareth a burden of wrongdoing is indeed a failure on that day
And he who hath done some good works being a believer he feareth not injustice nor begrudging of his wage
Thus we have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic and have displayed therein certain threats that peradventure they may keep from evil or that it may cause them to take heed
Then exalted be Allah the True King
And hasten not O Muhammad with the Qur an ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee and say My Lord
Increase me in knowledge
And verily We made a covenant of old with Adam but he forgot and We found no constancy in him
And when We said unto the angels Fall prostrate before Adam they fell prostrate all save Iblis he refused
Therefor we said O Adam
This is an enemy unto thee and unto thy wife so let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou come to toil
It is vouchsafed unto thee that thou hungerest not therein nor art naked
And that thou thirstest not therein nor art exposed to the sun s heat
But the devil whispered to him saying O Adam
Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away
Then they twain ate thereof so that their shame became apparent unto them and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden
And Adam disobeyed his Lord so went astray
Then his Lord chose him and relented toward him and guided him
He said Go down hence both of you one of you a foe unto the other
But when there come unto you from Me a guidance then whoso followeth My guidance he will not go astray nor come to grief
But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me his will be a narrow life and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection
He will say My Lord
Wherefor hast Thou gathered me hither blind when I was wont to see
He will say So it must be
Our revelations came unto thee but thou didst forget them
In like manner thou art forgotten this Day
Thus do We reward him who is prodigal and believeth not the revelations of his Lord and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting
Is it not a guidance for them to know how many a generation We destroyed before them amid whose dwellings they walk
Lo therein verily are signs for men of thought
And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord and a term already fixed the judgment would have been inevitable in this world
Therefor O Muhammad bear with what they say and celebrate the praise of thy Lord ere the rising of the sun and ere the going down thereof And glorify Him some hours of the night and at the two ends of the day that thou mayst find acceptance
And strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoy the flower of the life of the world that We may try them thereby
The provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting
And enjoin upon thy people worship and be constant therein
We ask not of thee a provision We provided for thee
And the sequel is for righteousness
And they say If only he would bring us a miracle from his Lord
Hath there not come unto them the proof of what is in the former scriptures
And if we had destroyed them with some punishment before it they would assuredly have said Our Lord
If only Thou hadst sent unto us a messenger so that we might have followed Thy revelations before we were thus humbled and disgraced
Say Each is awaiting so await ye
Ye will come to know who are the owners of the path of equity and who is right
Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind while they turn away in heedlessness
Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen to it while they play
With hearts preoccupied
And they confer in secret The wrongdoers say Is this other than a mortal like you
Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see it
He saith My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth
He is the Hearer the Knower
Nay say they these are but muddled dreams nay he hath but invented it nay he is but a poet
Let him bring us a portent even as those of old who were Allah s messengers were sent with portents
Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them though We sent them portents would they then believe
And We sent not as Our messengers before thee other than men whom We inspired
Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not
We gave them not bodies that would not eat food nor were they immortals
Then we fulfilled the promise unto them
So we delivered them and whom We would and We destroyed the prodigals
Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder
Have ye then no sense
How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered and raised up after them another folk
And when they felt Our might behold them fleeing from it
But it was said unto them Flee not but return to that existence which emasculated you and to your dwellings that ye may be questioned
They cried Alas for us we were wrongdoers
And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn extinct
We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play
If We had wished to find a pastime We could have found it in Our presence if We ever did
Nay but We hurl the true against the false and it doth break its head and lo it vanisheth
And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe unto Him
Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth
And those who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him nor do they weary
They glorify Him night and day they flag not
Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead
If there were therein gods beside Allah then verily both the heavens and the earth had been disordered
Glorified be Allah the Lord of the Throne from all that they ascribe unto Him
He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth but they will be questioned
Or have they chosen other gods beside Him say Bring your proof of their godhead
This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me but most of them know not the Truth and so they are averse
And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him saying There is no Allah save Me Allah so worship Me
And they say The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son
Be He Glorified
Nay but those whom they call sons are honoured slaves
They speak not until He hath spoken and they act by His command
He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them and they cannot intercede except for him whom He accepteth and they quake for awe of Him
And one of them who should say Lo I am a god beside Him that one We should repay with hell
Thus We Repay wrongdoers
Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece then We parted them and we made every living thing of water
Will they not then believe
And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them and We have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way
And we have made the sky a roof withheld from them
Yet they turn away from its portents
And He it is Who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon
They float each in an orbit
We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee
What if thou diest can they be immortal
Every soul must taste of death and We try you with evil and with good for ordeal
And unto Us ye will be returned
And when those who disbelieve behold thee they but choose thee out for mockery saying Is this he who maketh mention of your gods
And they would deny all mention of the Beneficent
Man is made of haste
I shall show you My portents but ask Me not to hasten
And they say When will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful
If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not be able to drive off the fire from their faces and from their backs and they will not be helped
Nay but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them and they will be unable to repel it neither will they be reprieved
Messengers before thee indeed were mocked but that whereat they mocked surrounded those who scoffed at them
Say Who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the Beneficent
Nay but they turn away from mention of their Lord
Or have they gods who can shield them from Us
They cannot help themselves nor can they be defended from Us
Nay but We gave these and their fathers ease until life grew long for them
See they not how we aim to the land reducing it of its outlying parts
Can they then be the victors
Say O Muhammad unto mankind I warn you only by the Inspiration
But the deaf hear not the call when they are warned
And if a breath of thy Lord s punishment were to touch them they assuredly would say Alas for us
Lo we were wrongdoers
And We set a just balance for the Day of Resurrection so that no soul is wronged in aught
Though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard seed We bring it
And We suffice for reckoners
And We verily gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion of right and wrong and a light and a Reminder for those who keep from evil
Those who fear their Lord in secret and who dread the Hour of doom
This is a blessed Reminder that we have revealed Will ye then reject it
And We verily gave Abraham of old his proper course and We were Aware of him
When he said unto his father and his folk What are these images unto which ye pay devotion
They said We found our fathers worshippers of them
He said Verily ye and your fathers were in plain error
They said Bringest thou unto us the truth or art thou some jester
He said Nay but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth Who created them and I am of those who testify unto that
And by Allah I shall circumvent your idols after ye have gone away and turned your backs
Then he reduced them to fragments all save the chief of them that haply they might have recourse to it
They said Who hath done this to our gods
Surely it must be some evildoer
They said We heard a youth make mention of them who is called Abraham
They said Then bring him hither before the people s eyes that they may testify
They said Is it thou who hast done this to our gods O Abraham
He said But this their chief hath done it
So question them if they can speak
Then gathered they apart and said Lo ye yourselves are the wrongdoers
And they were utterly confounded and they said Well thou knowest that these speak not
He said Worship ye then instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all nor harm you
Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of Allah
Have ye then no sense
They cried Burn him and stand by your gods if ye will be doing
We said O fire be coolness and peace for Abraham
And they wished to set a snare for him but We made them the greater losers
And We rescued him and Lot and brought them to the land which We have blessed for all peoples
And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob as a grandson Each of them We made righteous
And We made them chiefs who guide by Our command and We inspired in them the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of alms and they were worshippers of Us alone
And unto Lot we gave judgment and knowledge and We delivered him from the community that did abominations
Lo they were folk of evil lewd
And We brought him in unto Our mercy
Lo he was of the righteous
And Noah when he cried of old We heard his prayer and saved him and his household from the great affliction
And delivered him from the people who denied Our revelations
Lo they were folk of evil therefor did We drown them all
And David and Solomon when they gave judgment concerning the field when people s sheep had strayed and browsed therein by night and We were witnesses to their judgment
And We made Solomon to understand the case and unto each of them We gave judgment and knowledge
And we subdued the hills and the birds to hymn His praise along with David
We were the doers thereof
And We taught him the art of making garments of mail to protect you in your daring
Are ye then thankful
And unto Solomon We subdued the wind in its raging
It set by his command toward the land which We had blessed
And of everything We are Aware
And of the evil ones subdued We unto him some who dived for pearls for him and did other work and We were warders unto them
And Job when he cried unto his Lord saying Lo adversity afflicteth me and Thou art Most Merciful of all who show mercy
Then We heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he suffered and We gave him his household that he had lost and the like thereof along with them a mercy from Our store and a remembrance for the worshippers
And mention Ishmael and Idris and Dhu lKifl
All were of the steadfast
And We brought them in unto Our mercy
Lo they are among the righteous
And mention Dhu nNun when he went off in anger and deemed that We had no power over him but he cried out in the darkness saying There is no Allah save Thee
Be Thou Glorified
Lo I have been a wrongdoer
Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish
Thus we save believers
And Zachariah when he cried unto his Lord My Lord
Leave me not childless though Thou art the Best of inheritors
Then We heard his prayer and bestowed upon him John and adjusted his wife to bear a child for him
Lo they used to vie one with the other in good deeds and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear and were submissive unto Us
And she who was chaste therefor We breathed into her something of Our Spirit and made her and her son a token for all peoples
Lo this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord so worship Me
And they have broken their religion into fragments among them yet all are returning unto Us
Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer there will be no rejection of his effort
Lo We record it for him
And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed that they shall not return
Until when Gog and Magog are let loose and they hasten out of every mound
And the True Promise draweth nigh then behold them staring wide in terror the eyes of those who disbelieve
They say Alas for us
We lived in forgetfulness of this
Ah but we were wrongdoers
Lo ye idolaters and that which ye worship beside Allah are fuel of hell
Thereunto ye will come
If these had been gods they would not have come thither but all will abide therein
Therein wailing is their portion and therein they hear not
Lo those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from Us they will be far removed from thence
They will not hear the slightest sound thereof while they abide in that which their souls desire
The Supreme Horror will not grieve them and the angels will welcome them saying This is your Day which ye were promised
The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written scroll
As We began the first creation We shall repeat it
It is a promise binding upon Us
Lo We are to perform it
And verily we have written in the Scripture after the Reminder My righteous slaves will inherit the earth
Lo there is a plain statement for folk who are devout
We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples
Say It is only inspired in me that your Allah is One Allah
Will ye then surrender unto Him
But if they are averse then say I have warned you all alike although I know not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised
Lo He knoweth that which is said openly and that which ye conceal
And I know not but that this may be a trial for you and enjoyment for a while
He saith My Lord
Judge Thou with truth
Our Lord is the Beneficent Whose help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe unto Him
O mankind
Fear your Lord
Lo the earthquake of the Hour of Doom is a tremendous thing
On the day when ye behold it every nursing mother will forget her nursling and every pregnant one will be delivered of her burden and thou Muhammad wilt see mankind as drunken yet they will not be drunken but the Doom of Allah will be strong upon them
Among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge and followeth each froward devil
For him it is decreed that whoso taketh him for friend he verily will mislead him and will guide him to the punishment of the Flame
O mankind if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection then lo We have created you from dust then from a drop of seed then from a clot then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless that We may make it clear for you
And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time and afterward We bring you forth as infants then give you growth that ye attain your full strength
And among you there is he who dieth young and among you there is he who is brought back to the most abject time of life so that after knowledge he knoweth naught
And thou Muhammad seest the earth barren but when We send down water thereon it doth thrill and swell and put forth every lovely kind of growth
That is because Allah He is the Truth and because He quickeneth the dead and because He is Able to do all things
And because the Hour will come there is no doubt thereof and because Allah will raise those who are in the graves
And among mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light
Turning away in pride to beguile men from the way of Allah
For him in this world is ignominy and on the Day of Resurrection We make him taste the doom of burning
And unto him it will be said This is for that which thy two hands have sent before and because Allah is no oppressor of His slaves
And among mankind is he who worshippeth Allah upon a narrow marge so that if good befalleth him he is content therewith but if a trial befalleth him he falleth away utterly
He loseth both the world and the Hereafter
That is the sheer loss
He calleth beside Allah unto that which hurteth him not nor benefiteth him
That is the far error
He calleth unto him whose harm is nearer than his benefit verily an evil patron and verily an evil friend
Lo Allah causeth those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow
Lo Allah doth what He intendeth
Whoso is wont to think through envy that Allah will not give him Muhammad victory in the world and the Hereafter and is enraged at the thought of his victory let him stretch a rope up to the roof of his dwelling and let him hang himself Then let him see whether his strategy dispelleth that whereat he rageth
Thus We reveal it as plain revelations and verily Allah guideth whom He will
Lo those who believe this revelation and those who are Jews and the Sabaeans and the Christians and the Magians and the idolaters Lo Allah will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection
Lo Allah is Witness over all things
Hast thou not seen that unto Allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars and the hills and the trees and the beasts and many of mankind while there are many unto whom the doom is justly due
He whom Allah scorneth there is none to give him honour
Lo Allah doeth what He will
These twain the believers and the disbelievers are two opponents who contend concerning their Lord
But as for those who disbelieve garments of fire will be cut out for them boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads
Whereby that which is in their bellies and their skins too will be melted
And for them are hooked rods of iron
Whenever in their anguish they would go forth from thence they are driven back therein and it is said unto them Taste the doom of burning
Lo Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will be allowed armlets of gold and pearls and their raiment therein will be silk
They are guided unto gentle speech they are guided unto the path of the Glorious One
Lo those who disbelieve and bar men from the way of Allah and from the Inviolable Place of Worship which We have appointed for mankind together the dweller therein and the nomad whosoever seeketh wrongful partiality therein him We shall cause to taste a painful doom
And remember when We prepared for Abraham the place of the holy House saying Ascribe thou no thing as partner unto Me and purify My House for those who make the round thereof and those who stand and those who bow and make prostration
And proclaim unto mankind the pilgrimage They will come unto thee on foot and on every lean camel they will come from every deep ravine
That they may witness things that are of benefit to them and mention the name of Allah on appointed days over the beast of cattle that He hath bestowed upon them
Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor unfortunate
Then let them make an end of their unkemptness and pay their vows and go around the ancient House
That is the command
And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah it will be well for him in the sight of his Lord
The cattle are lawful unto you save that which hath been told you
So shun the filth of idols and shun lying speech
Turning unto Allah only not ascribing partners unto Him for whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had snatched him or the wind had blown him to a faroff place
That is the command
And whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to Allah it surely is from devotion of the hearts
Therein are benefits for you for an appointed term and afterward they are brought for sacrifice unto the ancient House
And for every nation have We appointed a ritual that they may mention the name of Allah over the beast of cattle that He hath given them for food and your god is One God therefor surrender unto Him
And give good tidings O Muhammad to the humble
Whose hearts fear when Allah is mentioned and the patient of whatever may befall them and those who establish worship and who spend of that We have bestowed on them
And the camels We have appointed them among the ceremonies of Allah
Therein ye have much good
So mention the name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines
Then when their flanks fall dead eat thereof and feed the beggar and the suppliant
Thus have We made them subject unto you that haply ye may give thanks
Their flesh and their food reach not Allah but the devotion from you reacheth Him
Thus have We made them subject unto you that ye may magnify Allah that He hath guided you
And give good tidings O Muhammad to the good
Lo Allah defendeth those who are true
Lo Allah loveth not each treacherous ingrate
Sanction is given unto those who fight because they have been wronged and Allah is indeed Able to give them victory
Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said Our Lord is Allah For had it not been for Allah s repelling some men by means of others cloisters and churches and oratories and mosques wherein the name of Allah is oft mentioned would assuredly have been pulled down
Verily Allah helpeth one who helpeth Him
Lo Allah is Strong Almighty
Those who if We give them power in the land establish worship and pay the poordue and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity
And Allah s is the sequel of events
If they deny thee Muhammad even so the folk of Noah and the tribes of A ad and Thamud before thee denied Our messengers
And the folk of Abraham and the folk of Lot
And the dwellers in Midian
And Moses was denied but I indulged the disbelievers a long while then I seized them and how terrible was My abhorrence
How many a township have We destroyed while it was sinful so that it lieth to this day in ruins and how many a deserted well and lofty tower
Have they not travelled in the land and have they hearts wherewith to feel and ears wherewith to hear
For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind but it is the hearts which are within the bosoms that grow blind
And they will bid thee hasten on the Doom and Allah faileth not His promise but lo a Day with Allah is as a thousand years of what ye reckon
And how many a township did I suffer long though it was sinful Then I grasped it
Unto Me is the return
Say O mankind
I am only a plain warner unto you
Those who believe and do good works for them is pardon and a rich provision
While those who strive to thwart Our revelations such are rightful owners of the Fire
Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited the message Satan proposed opposition in respect of that which he recited thereof
But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth
Then Allah establisheth His revelations
Allah is Knower Wise
That He may make that which the devil proposeth a temptation for those in whose hearts is a disease and those whose hearts are hardened Lo the evildoers are in open schism
And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from thy Lord so that they may believe therein and their hearts may submit humbly unto Him Lo
Allah verily is guiding those who believe unto a right path
And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the Hour come upon them unawares or there come unto them the doom of a disastrous day
The Sovereignty on that day will be Allah s He will judge between them
Then those who believed and did good works will be in Gardens of Delight
While those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations for them will be a shameful doom
Those who fled their homes for the cause of Allah and then were slain or died Allah verily will provide for them a good provision Lo
Allah He verily is Best of all who make provision
Assuredly He will cause them to enter by an entry that they will love
Lo Allah verily is Knower Indulgent
That is so
And whoso hath retaliated with the like of that which he was made to suffer and then hath again been wronged Allah will succour him
Lo Allah verily is Mild Forgiving
That is because Allah maketh the night to pass into the day and maketh the day to pass into the night and because Allah is Hearer Seer
That is because Allah He is the True and that whereon they call instead of Him it is the false and because Allah He is the High the Great
Seest thou not how Allah sendeth down water from the sky and then the earth becometh green upon the morrow
Lo Allah is Subtile Aware
Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth
Lo Allah He verily is the Absolute the Owner of Praise
Hast thou not seen how Allah hath made all that is in the earth subservient unto you
And the ship runneth upon the sea by His command and He holdeth back the heaven from falling on the earth unless by His leave
Lo Allah is for mankind Full of Pity Merciful
And He it is Who gave you life then He will cause you to die and then will give you life again
Lo man is verily an ingrate
Unto each nation have We given sacred rites which they are to perform so let them not dispute with thee of the matter but summon thou unto thy Lord
Lo thou indeed followest right guidance
And if they wrangle with thee say Allah is Best Aware of what ye do
Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein ye used to differ
Hast thou not known that Allah knoweth all that is in the heaven and the earth
Lo it is in a record
Lo that is easy for Allah
And they worship instead of Allah that for which He hath sent down no warrant and that whereof they have no knowledge
For evildoers there is no helper
And when Our revelations are recited unto them thou knowest the denial in the faces of those who disbelieve they all but attack those who recite Our revelations unto them
Say Shall I proclaim unto you worse than that
The Fire
Allah hath promised it for those who disbelieve
A hapless journey s end
O mankind
A similitude is coined so pay ye heed to it Lo those on whom ye call beside Allah will never create a fly though they combine together for the purpose
And if the fly took something from them they could not rescue it from it
So weak are both the seeker and the sought
They measure not Allah His rightful measure
Lo Allah is Strong Almighty
Allah chooseth from the angels messengers and also from mankind
Lo Allah is Hearer Seer
He knoweth all that is before them and all that is behind them and unto Allah all things are returned A
O ye who believe
Bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your Lord and do good that haply ye may prosper
And strive for Allah with the endeavour which is His right
He hath chosen you and hath not laid upon you in religion any hardship the faith of your father Abraham is yours
He hath named you Muslims of old time and in this Scripture that the messenger may be a witness against you and that ye may be witnesses against mankind
So establish worship pay the poordue and hold fast to Allah
He is your Protecting friend
A blessed Patron and a blessed Helper
Successful indeed are the believers
Who are humble in their prayers
And who shun vain conversation
And who are payers of the poordue
And who guard their modesty
Save from their wives or the slaves that their right hands possess for then they are not blameworthy
But whoso craveth beyond that such are transgressors
And who are shepherds of their pledge and their covenant
And who pay heed to their prayers
These are the heirs
Who will inherit paradise
There they will abide
Verily We created man from a product of wet earth
Then placed him as a drop of seed in a safe lodging
Then fashioned We the drop a clot then fashioned We the clot a little lump then fashioned We the little lump bones then clothed the bones with flesh and then produced it as another creation
So blessed be Allah the Best of creators
Then lo after that ye surely die
Then lo on the Day of Resurrection ye are raised again
And We have created above you seven paths and We are never unmindful of creation
And we send down from the sky water in measure and We give it lodging in the earth and lo
We are Able to withdraw it
Then We produce for you therewith gardens of datepalms and grapes wherein is much fruit for you and whereof ye eat
And a tree that springeth forth from Mount Sinai that groweth oil and relish for the eaters
And lo in the cattle there is verily a lesson for you
We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies and many uses have ye in them and of them do ye eat
And on them and on the ship ye are carried
And We verily sent Noah unto his folk and he said O my people
Serve Allah
Ye have no other Allah save Him
Will ye not ward off evil
But the chieftains of his folk who disbelieved said This is only a mortal like you who would make himself superior to you
Had Allah willed He surely could have sent down angels
We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old
He is only a man in whom is a madness so watch him for a while
He said My Lord
Help me because they deny me
Then We inspired in him saying Make the ship under Our eyes and Our inspiration
Then when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water introduce therein of every kind two spouses and thy household save him thereof against whom the Word hath already gone forth
And plead not with Me on behalf of those who have done wrong
Lo they will be drowned
And when thou art on board the ship thou and whoso is with thee then say Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk
And say My Lord
Cause me to land at a blessed landingplace for Thou art Best of all who bring to land
Lo herein verily are portents for lo
We are ever putting mankind to the test
Then after them We brought forth another generation
And we sent among them a messenger of their own saying Serve Allah Ye have no other Allah save Him
Will ye not ward off evil
And the chieftains of his folk who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter and whom We had made soft in the life of the world said This is only a mortal like you who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink
If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves then lo ye surely would be losers
Doth he promise you that you when ye are dead and have become dust and bones will again be brought forth
Begone begone with that which ye are promised
There is naught but our life of the world we die and we live and we shall not be raised again
He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah
We are not going to put faith in him
He said My Lord
Help me because they deny me
He said In a little while they surely will become repentant
So the Awful Cry overtook them rightfully and We made them like as wreckage that a torrent hurleth
A far removal for wrongdoing folk
Then after them We brought forth other generations
No nation can outstrip its term nor yet postpone it
Then We sent our messengers one after another
Whenever its messenger came unto a nation they denied him so We caused them to follow one another to disaster and We made them bywords
A far removal for folk who believe not
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our tokens and a clear warrant
Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs but they scorned them and they were despotic folk
And they said Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves and whose folk are servile unto us
So they denied them and became of those who were destroyed
And We verily gave Moses the Scripture that haply they might go aright
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a portent and We gave them refuge on a height a place of flocks and watersprings
O ye messengers
Eat of the good things and do right
Lo I am Aware of what ye do
And lo this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord so keep your duty unto Me
But they mankind have broken their religion among them into sects each group rejoicing in its tenets
So leave them in their error till a time
Think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them
We hasten unto them with good things
Nay but they perceive not
Lo those who go in awe for fear of their Lord
And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord
And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord
And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are about to return unto their Lord
These race for the good things and they shall win them in the race
And we task not any soul beyond its scope and with Us is a Record which speaketh the truth and they will not be wronged
Nay but their hearts are in ignorance of this Qur an and they have other works besides which they are doing
Till when We grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment behold they supplicate
Supplicate not this day
Assuredly ye will not be helped by Us
My revelations were recited unto you but ye used to turn back on your heels
In scorn thereof Nightly did ye rave together
Have they not pondered the Word or hath that come unto them which came not unto their fathers of old
Or know they not their messenger and so reject him
Or say they There is a madness in him
Nay but he bringeth them the Truth and most of them are haters of the Truth
And if the Truth had followed their desires verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein had been corrupted
Nay We have brought them their Reminder but from their Reminder they now turn away
Or dost thou ask of them O Muhammad any tribute
But the bounty of thy Lord is better for He is Best of all who make provision
And lo thou summonest them indeed unto a straight path
And lo those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed astray from the path
Though We had mercy on them and relieved them of the harm afflicting them they still would wander blindly on in their contumacy
Already have We grasped them with punishment but they humble not themselves unto their Lord nor do they pray
Until when We open for them the gate of extreme punishment behold they are aghast thereat
He it is Who hath created for you ears and eyes and hearts
Small thanks give ye
And He it is Who hath sown you broadcast in the earth and unto Him ye will be gathered
And He it is Who giveth life and causeth death and His is the difference of night and day
Have ye then no sense
Nay but they say the like of that which said the men of old
They say When we are dead and have become mere dust and bones shall we then forsooth be raised again
We were already promised this we and our forefathers
Lo this is naught but fables of the men of old
Say Unto Whom belongeth the earth and whosoever is therein if ye have knowledge
They will say Unto Allah
Say Will ye not then remember
Say Who is Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Tremendous Throne
They will say Unto Allah all that belongeth
Say Will ye not then keep duty unto Him
Say In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and He protecteth while against Him there is no protection if ye have knowledge
They will say Unto Allah all that belongeth
Say How then are ye bewitched
Nay but We have brought them the Truth and lo they are liars
Allah hath not chosen any son nor is there any god along with Him else would each god have assuredly championed that which he created and some of them would assuredly have overcome others
Glorified be Allah above all that they allege
Knower of the Invisible and the Visible and Exalted be He over all that they ascribe as partners unto Him
Say My Lord
If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised
My Lord then set me not among the wrongdoing folk
And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them
Repel evil with that which is better
We are Best Aware of that which they allege
And say My Lord
I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones
And I seek refuge in Thee my Lord lest they be present with me
Until when death cometh unto one of them he saith My Lord
Send me back
That I may do right in that which I have left behind
But nay
It is but a word that he speaketh and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are raised
And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that day nor will they ask of one another
Then those whose scales are heavy they are the successful
And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls in hell abiding
The fire burneth their faces and they are glum therein
It will be said Were not My revelations recited unto you and then ye used to deny them
They will say Our Lord
Our evil fortune conquered us and we were erring folk
Our Lord
Oh bring us forth from hence
If we return to evil then indeed we shall be wrongdoers
He saith Begone therein and speak not unto Me
Lo there was a party of My slaves who said Our Lord
We believe therefor forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of all who show mercy
But ye chose them for a laughingstock until they caused you to forget remembrance of Me while ye laughed at them
Lo I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast in that they even they are the triumphant
He will say How long tarried ye in the earth counting by years
They will say We tarried by a day or part of a day
Ask of those who keep count
He will say Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew
Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught and that ye would not be returned unto Us
Now Allah be Exalted the True King
There is no Allah save Him the Lord of the Throne of Grace
He who crieth unto any other god along with Allah hath no proof thereof His reckoning is only with his Lord
Lo disbelievers will not be successful
And O Muhammad say My Lord
Forgive and have mercy for Thou art Best of all who show mercy
Here is a surah which We have revealed and enjoined and wherein We have revealed plain tokens that haply ye may take heed
The adulterer and the adulteress scourge ye each one of them with a hundred stripes
And let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to Allah if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day
And let a party of believers witness their punishment
The adulterer shall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress and the adulteress none shall marry save an adulterer or an idolater
All that is forbidden unto believers
And those who accuse honourable women but bring not four witnesses scourge them with eighty stripes and never afterward accept their testimony They indeed are evildoers
Save those who afterward repent and make amends
For such lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
As for those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses except themselves let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies swearing by Allah that he is of those who speak the truth
And yet a fifth invoking the curse of Allah on him if he is of those who lie
And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bear witness before Allah four times that the thing he saith is indeed false
And a fifth time that the wrath of Allah be upon her if he speaketh truth
And had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you and that Allah is Clement Wise ye had been undone
Lo they who spread the slander are a gang among you
Deem it not a bad thing for you nay it is good for you
Unto every man of them will be paid that which he hath earned of the sin and as for him among them who had the greater share therein his will be an awful doom
Why did not the believers men and women when ye heard it think good of their own own folk and say It is a manifest untruth
Why did they not produce four witnesses
Since they produce not witnesses they verily are liars in the sight of Allah
Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you in the world and the Hereafter an awful doom had overtaken you for that whereof ye murmured
When ye welcomed it with your tongues and uttered with your mouths that whereof ye had no knowledge ye counted it a trifle
In the sight of Allah it is very great
Wherefor when ye heard it said ye not It is not for us to speak of this
Glory be to Thee O Allah
This is awful calumny
Allah admonisheth you that ye repeat not the like thereof ever if ye are in truth believers
And He expoundeth unto you the revelations
Allah is Knower Wise
Lo those who love that slander should be spread concerning those who believe theirs will be a painful punishment in the world and the Hereafter
Allah knoweth Ye know not
Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you and that Allah is Clement Merciful ye had been undone
O ye who believe
Follow not the footsteps of the devil
Unto whomsoever followeth the footsteps of the devil lo he commandeth filthiness and wrong
Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you not one of you would ever have grown pure
But Allah causeth whom He will to grow
And Allah is Hearer Knower
And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear not to give to the near of kin and to the needy and to fugitives for the cause of Allah
Let them forgive and show indulgence
Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Lo as for those who traduce virtuous believing women who are careless cursed are they in the world and the Hereafter
Theirs will be an awful doom
On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet testify against them as to what they used to do
On that day Allah will pay them their just due and they will know that Allah He is the Manifest Truth
Vile women are for vile men and vile men for vile women
Good women are for good men and good men for good women such are innocent of that which people say For them is pardon and a bountiful provision
O ye who believe
Enter not houses other than your own without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof
That is better for you that ye may be heedful
And if ye find noone therein still enter not until permission hath been given
And if it be said unto you Go away again then go away for it is purer for you
Allah knoweth what ye do
It is no sin for you to enter uninhabited houses wherein is comfort for you
Allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide
Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest
That is purer for them
Lo Allah is aware of what they do
And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent and to draw their veils over their bosoms and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands or fathers or husbands fathers or their sons or their husbands sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or sisters sons or their women or their slaves or male attendants who lack vigour or children who know naught of women s nakedness And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment
And turn unto Allah together O believers in order that ye may succeed
And marry such of you as are solitary and the pious of your slaves and maidservants
If they be poor Allah will enrich them of His bounty
Allah is of ample means Aware
And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste till Allah give them independence by His grace
And such of your slaves as seek a writing of emancipation write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them and bestow upon them of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you
Force not your slavegirls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world if they would preserve their chastity
And if one force them then unto them after their compulsion lo Allah will be Forgiving Merciful
And verily We have sent down for you revelations that make plain and the example of those who passed away before you An admonition unto those who ward off evil
Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth
The similitude of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp The lamp is in a glass
The glass is as it were a shining star This lamp is kindled from a blessed tree an olive neither of the East nor of the West whose oil would almost glow forth of itself though no fire touched it
Light upon light
Allah guideth unto His light whom He will
And Allah speaketh to mankind in allegories for Allah is Knower of all things
This lamp is found in houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted and that His name shall be remembered therein
Therein do offer praise to Him at morn and evening
Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remembrance of Allah and constancy in prayer and paying to the poor their due who fear a day when hearts and eyeballs will be overturned
That Allah may reward them with the best of what they did and increase reward for them of His bounty
Allah giveth blessings without stint to whom He will
As for those who disbelieve their deeds are as a mirage in a desert The thirsty one supposeth it to be water till he cometh unto it and findeth it naught and findeth in the place thereof Allah Who payeth him his due and Allah is swift at reckoning
Or as darkness on a vast abysmal sea
There covereth him a wave above which is a wave above which is a cloud Layer upon layer of darkness
When he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it
And he for whom Allah hath not appointed light for him there is no light
Hast thou not seen that Allah He it is Whom all who are in the heavens and the earth praise and the birds in their flight
Of each He knoweth verily the worship and the praise and Allah is Aware of what they do
And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and unto Allah is the journeying
Hast thou not seen how Allah wafteth the clouds then gathereth them then maketh them layers and thou seest the rain come forth from between them He sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail and smiteth therewith whom He will and averteth it from whom He will The flashing of His lightning all but snatcheth away the sight
Allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night
Lo herein is indeed a lesson for those who see
Allah hath created every animal of water
Of them is a kind that goeth upon its belly and a kind that goeth upon two legs and a kind that goeth upon four
Allah createth what He will
Lo Allah is Able to do all things
Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them
Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path
And they say We believe in Allah and the messenger and we obey then after that a faction of them turn away
Such are not believers
And when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them lo a faction of them are averse
But if right had been with them they would have come unto him willingly
Is there in their hearts a disease or have they doubts or fear they lest Allah and His messenger should wrong them in judgment
Nay but such are evildoers
The saying of all true believers when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them is only that they say We hear and we obey
And such are the successful
He who obeyeth Allah and His messenger and feareth Allah and keepeth duty unto Him such indeed are the victorious
They swear by Allah solemnly that if thou order them they will go forth
Say Swear not known obedience is better Lo
Allah is Informed of what ye do
Say Obey Allah and obey the messenger
But if ye turn away then it is for him to do only that wherewith he hath been charged and for you to do only that wherewith ye have been charged
If ye obey him ye will go aright
But the messenger hath no other charge than to convey the message plainly
Allah hath promised such of you as believe and do good work that He will surely make them to succeed the present rulers in the earth even as He caused those who were before them to succeed others and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He hath approved for them and will give them in exchange safety after their fear
They serve Me They ascribe no thing as partner unto Me
Those who disbelieve henceforth they are the miscreants
Establish worship and pay the poordue and obey the messenger that haply ye may find mercy
Think not that the disbelievers can escape in the land
Fire will be their home a hapless journey s end
O ye who believe
Let your slaves and those of you who have not come to puberty ask leave of you at three times before they come into your presence Before the prayer of dawn and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon and after the prayer of night
Three times of privacy for you
It is no sin for them or for you at other times when some of you go round attendant upon others if they come into your presence without leave
Thus Allah maketh clear the revelations for you
Allah is Knower Wise
And when the children among you come to puberty then let them ask leave even as those before them used to ask it
Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for you
Allah is Knower Wise
As for women past childbearing who have no hope of marriage it is no sin for them if they discard their outer clothing in such a way as not to show adornment
But to refrain is better for them
Allah is Hearer Knower
No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your fathers brothers or the houses of your fathers sisters or the houses of your mothers brothers or the houses of your mothers sisters or from that whereof ye hold the keys or from the house of a friend
No sin shall it be for you whether ye eat together or apart
But when ye enter houses salute one another with a greeting from Allah blessed and sweet
Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for you that haply ye may understand
They only are the true believers who believe in Allah and His messenger and when they are with him on some common errand go not away until they have asked leave of him
Lo those who ask leave of thee those are they who believe in Allah and His messenger
So if they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs give leave to whom thou wilt of them and ask for them forgiveness of Allah
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of another
Allah knoweth those of you who steal away hiding themselves
And let those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall them
Lo verily unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth
He knoweth your condition And He knoweth the Day when they are returned unto Him so that He may inform them of what they did
Allah is Knower of all things
Blessed is He Who hath revealed unto His slave the Criterion of right and wrong that he may be a warner to the peoples
He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth He hath chosen no son nor hath He any partner in the Sovereignty
He hath created everything and hath meted out for it a measure
Yet they choose beside Him other gods who create naught but are themselves created and possess not hurt nor profit for themselves and possess not death nor life nor power to raise the dead
Those who disbelieve say This is naught but a lie that he hath invented and other folk have helped him with it so that they have produced a slander and a lie
And they say Fables of the men of old which he hath had written down so that they are dictated to him morn and evening
Say unto them O Muhammad He who knoweth the secret of the heavens and the earth hath revealed it
Lo He ever is Forgiving Merciful
And they say What aileth this messenger of Allah that he eateth food and walketh in the markets
Why is not an angel sent down unto him to be a warner with him
Or why is not treasure thrown down unto him or why hath he not a paradise from whence to eat
And the evildoers say Ye are but following a man bewitched
See how they coin similitudes for thee so that they are all astray and cannot find a road
Blessed is He Who if He will will assign thee better than all that Gardens underneath which rivers flow and will assign thee mansions
Nay but they deny the coming of the Hour and for those who deny the coming of the Hour We have prepared a flame
When it seeth them from afar they hear the crackling and the roar thereof
And when they are flung into a narrow place thereof chained together they pray for destruction there
Pray not that day for one destruction but pray for many destructions
Say Is that doom better or the Garden of Immortality which is promised unto those who ward off evil It will be their reward and journey s end
Therein abiding they have all that they desire
It is for thy Lord a promise that must be fulfilled
And on the day when He will assemble them and that which they worship instead of Allah and will say Was it ye who misled these my slaves or did they themselves wander from the way
They will say Be Thou Glorified it was not for us to choose any protecting friends beside thee but Thou didst give them and their fathers ease till they forgot the warning and became lost folk
Thus they will give you the lie regarding what ye say then ye can neither avert the doom nor obtain help
And whoso among you doeth wrong We shall make him taste great torment
We never sent before thee any messengers but lo they verily ate food and walked in the markets
And We have appointed some of you a test for others Will ye be steadfast
And thy Lord is ever Seer
And those who look not for a meeting with Us say Why are angels not sent down unto us and Why do we not see our Lord
Assuredly they think too highly of themselves and are scornful with great pride
On the day when they behold the angels on that day there will be no good tidings for the guilty and they will cry A forbidding ban
And We shall turn unto the work they did and make it scattered motes
Those who have earned the Garden on that day will be better in their home and happier in their place of noonday rest
A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder and the angels will be sent down a grand descent
The Sovereignty on that day will be the True Sovereignty belonging to the Beneficent One and it will be a hard day for disbelievers
On the day when the wrongdoer gnaweth his hands he will say Ah would that I had chosen a way together with the messenger of Allah
Alas for me
Ah would that I had never taken such an one for friend
He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me
Satan was ever man s deserter in the hour of need
And the messenger saith O my Lord
Lo mine own folk make this Qur an of no account
Even so have We appointed unto every prophet an opponent from among the guilty but Allah sufficeth for a Guide and Helper
And those who disbelieve say Why is the Qur an not revealed unto him all at once
It is revealed thus that We may strengthen thy heart therewith and We have arranged it in right order
And they bring thee no similitude but We bring thee the Truth as against it and better than their similitude as argument
Those who will be gathered on their faces unto hell such are worse in plight and further from the right road
We verily gave Moses the Scripture and placed with him his brother Aaron as henchman
Then We said Go together unto the folk who have denied Our revelations
Then We destroyed them a complete destruction
And Noah s folk when they denied the messengers We drowned them and made of them a portent for mankind
We have prepared a painful doom for evildoers
And the tribes of A ad and Thamud and the dwellers in ArRass and many generations in between
Each of them We warned by examples and each of them We brought to utter ruin
And indeed they have passed by the township whereon was rained the fatal rain
Can it be that they have not seen it
Nay but they hope for no resurrection
And when they see thee O Muhammad they treat thee only as a jest saying Is this he whom Allah sendeth as a messenger
He would have led us far away from our gods if we had not been staunch to them
They will know when they behold the doom who is more astray as to the road
Hast thou seen him who chooseth for his god his own lust
Wouldst thou then be guardian over him
Or deemest thou that most of them hear or understand
They are but as the cattle nay but they are farther astray
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord hath spread the shade And if He willed He could have made it still then We have made the sun its pilot
Then We withdraw it unto Us a gradual withdrawal
And He it is Who maketh night a covering for you and sleep repose and maketh day a resurrection
And He it is Who sendeth the winds glad tidings heralding His mercy and We send down purifying water from the sky
That We may give life thereby to a dead land and We give many beasts and men that We have created to drink thereof
And verily We have repeated it among them that they may remember but most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude
If We willed We could raise up a warner in every village
So obey not the disbelievers but strive against them herewith with a great endeavour
And He it is Who hath given independence to the two seas though they meet one palatable sweet and the other saltish bitter and hath set a bar and a forbidding ban between them
And He it is Who hath created man from water and hath appointed for him kindred by blood and kindred by marriage for thy Lord is ever Powerful
Yet they worship instead of Allah that which can neither benefit them nor hurt them
The disbeliever was ever a partisan against his Lord
And We have sent thee O Muhammad only as a bearer of good tidings and a warner
Say I ask of you no reward for this save that whoso will may choose a way unto his Lord
And trust thou in the Living One Who dieth not and hymn His praise
He sufficeth as the Knower of His bondmen s sins
Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days then He mounted the Throne
The Beneficent
Ask anyone informed concerning Him
And when it is said unto them Prostrate to the Beneficent they say And what is the Beneficent
Are we to prostrate to whatever thou Muhammad biddest us
And it increaseth aversion in them
Blessed be He Who hath placed in the heaven mansions of the stars and hath placed therein a great lamp and a moon giving light
And He it is Who hath appointed night and day in succession for him who desireth to remember or desireth thankfulness
The faithful slaves of the Beneficent are they who walk upon the earth modestly and when the foolish ones address them answer Peace
And who spend the night before their Lord prostrate and standing
And who say Our Lord
Avert from us the doom of hell lo the doom thereof is anguish
Lo it is wretched as abode and station
And those who when they spend are neither prodigal nor grudging and there is ever a firm station between the two
And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in course of justice nor commit adultery and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty
The doom will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection and he will abide therein disdained for ever
Save him who repenteth and believeth and doth righteous work as for such Allah will change their evil deeds to good deeds
Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
And whosoever repenteth and doeth good he verily repenteth toward Allah with true repentance
And those who will not witness vanity but when they pass near senseless play pass by with dignity
And those who when they are reminded of the revelations of their Lord fall not deaf and blind thereat
And who say Our Lord
Vouchsafe us comfort of our wives and of our offspring and make us patterns for all those who ward off evil
They will be awarded the high place forasmuch as they were steadfast and they will meet therein with welcome and the ward of peace
Abiding there for ever
Happy is it as abode and station
Say O Muhammad unto the disbelievers My Lord would not concern Himself with you but for your prayer
But now ye have denied the Truth therefor there will be judgment
Ta
Sin
Mim
These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain
It may be that thou tormentest thyself O Muhammad because they believe not
If We will We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it
Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One but they turn away from it
Now they have denied the Truth but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff
Have they not seen the earth how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein
Lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
And lo thy Lord He is indeed the Mighty the Merciful
And when thy Lord called Moses saying Go unto the wrongdoing folk
The folk of Pharaoh
Will they not ward off evil
He said My Lord
Lo I fear that they will deny me
And I shall be embarrassed and my tongue will not speak plainly therefor send for Aaron to help me
And they have a crime against me so I fear that they will kill me
He said Nay verily
So go ye twain with Our tokens
Lo We shall be with you Hearing
And come together unto Pharaoh and say Lo we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds
Saying Let the Children of Israel go with us
Pharaoh said unto Moses Did we not rear thee among us as a child
And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us
And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst and thou wast one of the ingrates
He said I did it then when I was of those who are astray
Then I fled from you when I feared you and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me of the number of those sent by Him
And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel
Pharaoh said And what is the Lord of the Worlds
Moses said Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if ye had but sure belief
Pharaoh said unto those around him Hear ye not
He said Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers
Pharaoh said Lo your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman
He said Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them if ye did but understand
Pharaoh said If thou choosest a god other than me I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners
He said Even though I show thee something plain
Pharaoh said Produce it then if thou art of the truthful
Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest
And he drew forth his hand and lo it was white to the beholders
Pharaoh said unto the chiefs about him Lo this is verily a knowing wizard
Who would drive you out of your land by his magic
Now what counsel ye
They said Put him off him and his brother and send into the cities summoners
Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard
So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed
And it was said unto the people Are ye also gathering
They said Aye so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners
And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners
He said Aye and ye will then surely be of those brought near to me
Moses said unto them Throw what ye are going to throw
Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said By Pharaoh s might lo we verily are the winners
Then Moses threw his staff and lo it swallowed that which they did falsely show
And the wizards were flung prostrate
Crying We believe in the Lord of the Worlds
The Lord of Moses and Aaron
Pharaoh said Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave
Lo he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic
But verily ye shall come to know
Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately and verily I will crucify you every one
They said It is no hurt for lo unto our Lord we shall return
Lo we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers
And We inspired Moses saying Take away My slaves by night for ye will be pursued
Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners
Who said Lo these indeed are but a little troop
And lo they are offenders against us
And lo we are a ready host
Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings
And treasures and a fair estate
Thus were those things taken from them and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them
And they overtook them at sunrise
And when the two hosts saw each other those with Moses said Lo we are indeed caught
He said Nay verily for lo my Lord is with me
He will guide me
Then We inspired Moses saying Smite the sea with thy staff
And it parted and each part was as a mountain vast
Then brought We near the others to that place
And We saved Moses and those with him every one
And We drowned the others
Lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
And lo thy Lord He is indeed the Mighty the Merciful
Recite unto them the story of Abraham
When he said unto his father and his folk What worship ye
They said We worship idols and are ever devoted unto them
He said Do they hear you when ye cry
Or do they benefit or harm you
They said Nay but we found our fathers acting on this wise
He said See now that which ye worship
Ye and your forefathers
Lo they are all an enemy unto me save the Lord of the Worlds
Who created me and He doth guide me
And Who feedeth me and watereth me
And when I sicken then He healeth me
And Who causeth me to die then giveth me life again
And Who I ardently hope will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment
My Lord
Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous
And give unto me a good report in later generations
And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight
And forgive my father
Lo he is of those who err
And abase me not on the day when they are raised
The day when wealth and sons avail not any man
Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart
And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off evil
And hell will appear plainly to the erring
And it will be said unto them Where is all that ye used to worship
Instead of Allah
Can they help you or help themselves
Then will they be hurled therein they and the seducers
And the hosts of Iblis together
And they will say when they are quarrelling therein
By Allah of a truth we were in error manifest
When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds
It was but the guilty who misled us
Now we have no intercessors
Nor any loving friend
Oh that we had another turn on earth that we might be of the believers
Lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
And lo thy Lord He is indeed the Mighty the Merciful
Noah s folk denied the messengers of Allah
When their brother Noah said unto them Will ye not ward off evil
Lo I am a faithful messenger unto you
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
And I ask of you no wage therefor my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
They said Shall we put faith in thee when the lowest of the people follow thee
He said And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing in the past
Lo their reckoning is my Lord s concern if ye but knew
And I am not here to repulse believers
I am only a plain warner
They said If thou cease not O Noah thou wilt surely be among those stoned to death
He said My Lord
Lo my own folk deny me
Therefor judge Thou between us a conclusive judgment and save me and those believers who are with me
And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship
Then afterward We drowned the others
Lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
And lo thy Lord He is indeed the Mighty the Merciful
The tribe of A ad denied the messengers of Allah
When their brother Hud said unto them Will ye not ward off evil
Lo I am a faithful messenger unto you
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
And I ask of you no wage therefor my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds
Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight
And seek ye out strongholds that haply ye may last for ever
And if ye seize by force seize ye as tyrants
Rather keep your duty to Allah and obey me
Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with the good things that ye know
Hath aided you with cattle and sons
And gardens and watersprings
Lo I fear for you the retribution of an awful day
They said It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who preach
This is but a fable of the men of old
And we shall not be doomed
And they denied him therefor We destroyed them
Lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
And lo thy Lord He is indeed the Mighty the Merciful
The tribe of Thamud denied the messengers of Allah
When their brother Salih said unto them Will ye not ward off evil
Lo I am a faithful messenger unto you
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
And I ask of you no wage therefor my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds
Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us
In gardens and watersprings
And tilled fields and heavysheathed palmtrees
Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain being skilful
Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me
And obey not the command of the prodigal
Who spread corruption in the earth and reform not
They said Thou art but one of the bewitched
Thou art but a mortal like us
So bring some token if thou art of the truthful
He said Behold this shecamel
She hath the right to drink at the well and ye have the right to drink each on an appointed day
And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful day
But they hamstrung her and then were penitent
So the retribution came on them
Lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
And lo thy Lord He is indeed the Mighty the Merciful
The folk of Lot denied the messengers of Allah
When their brother Lot said unto them Will ye not ward off evil
Lo I am a faithful messenger unto you
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
And I ask of you no wage therefor my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds
What Of all creatures do ye come unto the males
And leave the wives your Lord created for you
Nay but ye are froward folk
They said If thou cease not O Lot thou wilt soon be of the outcast
He said I am in truth of those who hate your conduct
My Lord
Save me and my household from what they do
So We saved him and his household every one
Save an old woman among those who stayed behind
Then afterward We destroyed the others
And We rained on them a rain
And dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned
Lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
And lo thy Lord He is indeed the Mighty the Merciful
The dwellers in the wood of Midian denied the messengers of Allah
When Shu eyb said unto them Will ye not ward off evil
Lo I am a faithful messenger unto you
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
And I ask of you no wage for it my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds
Give full measure and be not of those who give less than the due
And weigh with the true balance
Wrong not mankind in their goods and do not evil making mischief in the earth
And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old
They said Thou art but one of the bewitched
Thou art but a mortal like us and lo we deem thee of the liars
Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us if thou art of the truthful
He said My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do
But they denied him so there came on them the retribution of the day of gloom
Lo it was the retribution of an awful day
Lo herein is indeed a portent yet most of them are not believers
And lo thy Lord He is indeed the Mighty the Merciful
And lo it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds
Which the True Spirit hath brought down
Upon thy heart that thou mayst be one of the warners
In plain Arabic speech
And lo it is in the Scriptures of the men of old
Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it
And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs
And he had read it unto them they would not have believed in it
Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty
They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom
So that it will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not
Then they will say Are we to be reprieved
Would they now hasten on Our doom
Hast thou then seen if We content them for long years
And then cometh that which they were promised
How that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them
And We destroyed no township but it had its warners
For reminder for We never were oppressors
The devils did not bring it down
It is not meet for them nor is it in their power
Lo verily they are banished from the hearing
Therefor invoke not with Allah another god lest thou be one of the doomed
And warn thy tribe of near kindred
And lower thy wing in kindness unto those believers who follow thee
And if they thy kinsfolk disobey thee say Lo I am innocent of what they do
And put thy trust in the Mighty the Merciful
Who seeth thee when thou standest up to pray
And seeth thine abasement among those who fall prostrate in worship
Lo He only He is the Hearer the Knower
Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend
They descend on every sinful false one
They listen eagerly but most of them are liars
As for poets the erring follow them
Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley
And how they say that which they do not
Save those who believe and do good works and remember Allah much and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged
Those who do wrong will come to know by what a great reverse they will be overturned

These are revelations of the Qur an and a Scripture that maketh plain
A guidance and good tidings for believers
Who establish worship and pay the poordue and are sure of the Hereafter
Lo as for those who believe not in the Hereafter We have made their works fairseeming unto them so that they are all astray
Those are they for whom is the worst of punishment and in the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers
Lo as for thee Muhammad thou verily receivest the Qur an from the presence of One Wise Aware
Remember when Moses said unto his household Lo
I spy afar off a fire I will bring you tidings thence or bring to you a borrowed flame that ye may warm yourselves
But when he reached it he was called saying Blessed is Whosoever is in the fire and Whosoever is round about it
And Glorified be Allah the Lord of the Worlds
O Moses
Lo it is I Allah the Mighty the Wise
And throw down thy staff
But when he saw it writhing as it were a demon he turned to flee headlong but it was said unto him O Moses
Fear not the emissaries fear not in My presence
Save him who hath done wrong and afterward hath changed evil for good And lo
And put thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white but unhurt
This will be one among nine tokens unto Pharaoh and his people Lo they were ever evilliving folk
But when Our tokens came unto them plain to see they said This is mere magic
And they denied them though their souls acknowledged them for spite and arrogance
Then see the nature of the consequence for the wrongdoers
And We verily gave knowledge unto David and Solomon and they said Praise be to Allah Who hath preferred us above many of His believing slaves
And Solomon was David s heir And he said O mankind
Lo we have been taught the language of birds and have been given abundance of all things
This surely is evident favour
And there were gathered together unto Solomon his armies of the jinn and humankind and of the birds and they were set in battle order
Till when they reached the Valley of the Ants an ant exclaimed O ants
Enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his armies crush you unperceiving
And Solomon smiled laughing at her speech and said My Lord arouse me to be thankful for Thy favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents and to do good that shall be pleasing unto Thee and include me in the number of Thy righteous slaves
And he sought among the birds and said How is it that I see not the hoopoe or is he among the absent
I verily will punish him with hard punishment or I verily will slay him or he verily shall bring me a plain excuse
But he was not long in coming and he said I have found out a thing that thou apprehendest not and I come unto thee from Sheba with sure tidings
Lo I found a woman ruling over them and she hath been given abundance of all things and hers is a mighty throne
I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah and Satan maketh their works fairseeming unto them and debarreth them from the way of Truth so that they go not aright
So that they worship not Allah Who bringeth forth the hidden in the heavens and the earth and knoweth what ye hide and what ye proclaim
Allah there is no Allah save Him the Lord of the Tremendous Throne
Solomon said We shall see whether thou speakest truth or whether thou art of the liars
Go with this my letter and throw it down unto them then turn away and see what answer they return
The Queen of Sheba said when she received the letter O chieftains
Lo there hath been thrown unto me a noble letter
Lo it is from Solomon and lo it is In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful
Exalt not yourselves against me but come unto me as those who surrender
She said O chieftains
Pronounce for me in my case
I decide no case till ye are present with me
They said We are lords of might and lords of great prowess but it is for thee to command so consider what thou wilt command
She said Lo kings when they enter a township ruin it and make the honour of its people shame
Thus will they do
But lo I am going to send a present unto them and to see with what answer the messengers return
So when the envoy came unto Solomon the King said What Would ye help me with wealth
But that which Allah hath given me is better than that which He hath given you
Nay it is ye and not I who exult in your gift
Return unto them
We verily shall come unto them with hosts that they cannot resist and we shall drive them out from thence with shame and they will be abased
He said O chiefs
Which of you will bring me her throne before they come unto me surrendering
A stalwart of the jinn said I will bring it thee before thou canst rise from thy place
Lo I verily am strong and trusty for such work
One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said I will bring it thee before thy gaze returneth unto thee
And when he saw it set in his presence Solomon said This is of the bounty of my Lord that He may try me whether I give thanks or am ungrateful
Whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for the good of his own soul and whosoever is ungrateful is ungrateful only to his own soul s hurt For lo my Lord is Absolute in independence Bountiful
He said Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will go aright or be of those not rightly guided
So when she came it was said unto her Is thy throne like this
She said It is as though it were the very one
And Solomon said We were given the knowledge before her and we had surrendered to Allah
And all that she was wont to worship instead of Allah hindered her for she came of disbelieving folk
It was said unto her Enter the hall
And when she saw it she deemed it a pool and bared her legs
Solomon said Lo it is a hall made smooth of glass
She said My Lord
Lo
I have wronged myself and I surrender with Solomon unto Allah the Lord of the Worlds
And We verily sent unto Thamud their brother Salih saying Worship Allah
And lo they then became two parties quarrelling
He said O my people
Why will ye hasten on the evil rather than the good
Why will ye not ask pardon of Allah that ye may receive mercy
They said We augur evil of thee and those with thee
He said Your evil augury is with Allah
Nay but ye are folk that are being tested
And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and reformed not
They said Swear one to another by Allah that we verily will attack him and his household by night and afterward we will surely say unto his friend We witnessed not the destruction of his household And lo we are truthtellers
So they plotted a plot and We plotted a plot while they perceived not
Then see the nature of the consequence of their plotting for lo
We destroyed them and their people every one
See yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong
Lo herein is indeed a portent for a people who have knowledge
And we saved those who believed and used to ward off evil
And Lot when he said unto his folk Will ye commit abomination knowingly
Must ye needs lust after men instead of women
Nay but ye are folk who act senselessly
But the answer of his folk was naught save that they said Expel the household of Lot from your township for they forsooth are folk who would keep clean
Then We saved him and his household save his wife We destined her to be of those who stayed behind
And We rained a rain upon them
Dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned
Say O Muhammad Praise be to Allah and peace be on His slaves whom He hath chosen
Is Allah best or all that ye ascribe as partners unto Him
Is not He best Who created the heavens and the earth and sendeth down for you water from the sky wherewith We cause to spring forth joyous orchards whose trees it never hath been yours to cause to grow
Is there any Allah beside Allah
Nay but they are folk who ascribe equals unto Him
Is not He best Who made the earth a fixed abode and placed rivers in the folds thereof and placed firm hills therein and hath set a barrier between the two seas
Is there any Allah beside Allah
Nay but most of them know not
Is not He best Who answereth the wronged one when he crieth unto Him and removeth the evil and hath made you viceroys of the earth
Is there any Allah beside Allah
Little do they reflect
Is not He best Who guideth you in the darkness of the land and the sea He Who sendeth the winds as heralds of His mercy
Is there any Allah beside Allah
High Exalted be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner unto Him
Is not He best Who produceth creation then reproduceth it and Who provideth for you from the heaven and the earth
Is there any Allah beside Allah
Say Bring your proof if ye are truthful
Say O Muhammad None in the heavens and the earth knoweth the Unseen save Allah and they know not when they will be raised again
Nay but doth their knowledge reach to the Hereafter
Nay for they are in doubt concerning it Nay for they cannot see it
Yet those who disbelieve say When we have become dust like our fathers shall we verily be brought forth again
We were promised this forsooth we and our fathers
All this is naught but fables of the men of old
Say unto them O Muhammad Travel in the land and see the nature of the sequel for the guilty
And grieve thou not for them nor be in distress because of what they plot against thee
And they say When will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful
Say It may be that a part of that which ye would hasten on is close behind you
Lo thy Lord is full of bounty for mankind but most of them do not give thanks
Lo thy Lord knoweth surely all that their bosoms hide and all that they proclaim
And there is nothing hidden in the heaven or the earth but it is in a clear Record
Lo this Qur an narrateth unto the Children of Israel most of that concerning which they differ
And lo it is a guidance and a mercy for believers
Lo thy Lord will judge between them of His wisdom and He is the Mighty the Wise
Therefor O Muhammad put thy trust in Allah for thou standest on the plain Truth
Lo thou canst not make the dead to hear nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee
Nor canst thou lead the blind out of their error
Thou canst make none to hear save those who believe Our revelations and who have surrendered
And when the word is fulfilled concerning them We shall bring forth a beast of the earth to speak unto them because mankind had not faith in Our revelations
And remind them of the Day when We shall gather out of every nation a host of those who denied Our revelations and they will be set in array
Till when they come before their Lord He will say Did ye deny My revelations when ye could not compass them in knowledge or what was it that ye did
And the Word will be fulfilled concerning them because they have done wrong and they will not speak
Have they not seen how We have appointed the night that they may rest therein and the day sightgiving
Lo therein verily are portents for a people who believe
And remind them of the Day when the Trumpet will be blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth will start in fear save him whom Allah willeth And all come unto Him humbled
And thou seest the hills thou deemest solid flying with the flight of clouds the doing of Allah Who perfecteth all things Lo
He is Informed of what ye do
Whoso bringeth a good deed will have better than its worth and such are safe from fear that Day
And whoso bringeth an illdeed such will be flung down on their faces in the Fire Are ye rewarded aught save what ye did
Say I Muhammad am commanded only to serve the Lord of this land which He hath hallowed and unto Whom all things belong
And I am commanded to be of those who surrender unto Him
And to recite the Qur an
And whoso goeth right goeth right only for the good of his own soul and as for him who goeth astray Unto him say Lo I am only a warner
And say Praise be to Allah Who will show you His portents so that ye shall know them
And thy Lord is not unaware of what ye mortals do
Ta
Sin
Mim
These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain
We narrate unto thee somewhat of the story of Moses and Pharaoh with truth for folk who believe
Lo Pharaoh exalted himself in the earth and made its people castes
A tribe among them he oppressed killing their sons and sparing their women
Lo he was of those who work corruption
And We desired to show favour unto those who were oppressed in the earth and to make them examples and to make them the inheritors
And to establish them in the earth and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that which they feared from them
And We inspired the mother of Moses saying Suckle him and when thou fearest for him then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve
Lo
We shall bring him back unto thee and shall make him one of Our messengers
And the family of Pharaoh took him up that he might become for them an enemy and a sorrow Lo
Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinning
And the wife of Pharaoh said He will be a consolation for me and for thee
Kill him not
Peradventure he may be of use to us or we may choose him for a son
And they perceived not
And the heart of the mother of Moses became void and she would have betrayed him if We had not fortified her heart that she might be of the believers
And she said unto his sister Trace him
So she observed him from afar and they perceived not
And We had before forbidden fostermothers for him so she said Shall I show you a household who will rear him for you and take care of him
So We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieve and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true
But most of them know not
And when he reached his full strength and was ripe We gave him wisdom and knowledge
Thus do We reward the good
And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk and he found therein two men fighting one of his own caste and the other of his enemies and he who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his enemies
So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him
He said This is of the devil s doing
Lo he is an enemy a mere misleader
He said My Lord Lo
I have wronged my soul so forgive me
Then He forgave him
Lo
He is the Forgiving the Merciful
He said My Lord
Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me I will nevermore be a supporter of the guilty
And morning found him in the city fearing vigilant when behold he who had appealed to him the day before cried out to him for help
Moses said unto him Lo thou art indeed a mere hothead
And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both he said O Moses
Wouldst thou kill me as thou didst kill a person yesterday
Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant in the land thou wouldst not be of the reformers
And a man came from the uttermost part of the city running He said O Moses
Lo the chiefs take counsel against thee to slay thee therefor escape
Lo
I am of those who give thee good advice
So he escaped from thence fearing vigilant He said My Lord
Deliver me from the wrongdoing folk
And when he turned his face toward Midian he said Peradventure my Lord will guide me in the right road
And when he came unto the water of Midian he found there a whole tribe of men watering
And he found apart from them two women keeping back their flocks He said What aileth you
The two said We cannot give our flocks to drink till the shepherds return from the water and our father is a very old man
So he watered their flock for them Then he turned aside into the shade and said My Lord
I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest down for me
Then there came unto him one of the two women walking shyly She said Lo my father biddeth thee that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou didst water the flock for us
Then when he came unto him and told him the whole story he said Fear not
Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk
One of the two women said O my father
Hire him For the best man that thou canst hire in the strong the trustworthy
He said Lo I fain would marry thee to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for the term of eight pilgrimages
Then if thou completest ten it will be of thine own accord for I would not make it hard for thee
Allah willing thou wilt find me of the righteous
He said That is settled between thee and me
Whichever of the two terms I fulfil there will be no injustice to me and Allah is Surety over what we say
Then when Moses had fulfilled the term and was travelling with his housefolk he saw in the distance a fire and said unto his housefolk Bide ye here
Lo
I see in the distance a fire peradventure I shall bring you tidings thence or a brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves
And when he reached it he was called from the right side of the valley in the blessed field from the tree O Moses Lo
I even I am Allah the Lord of the Worlds
Throw down thy staff
And when he saw it writhing as it had been a demon he turned to flee headlong and it was said unto him O Moses
Draw nigh and fear not
Lo thou art of those who are secure
Thrust thy hand into the bosom of thy robe it will come forth white without hurt
And guard thy heart from fear
Then these shall be two proofs from your Lord unto Pharaoh and his chiefs
Lo they are evilliving folk
He said My Lord Lo
I killed a man among them and I fear that they will kill me
My brother Aaron is more eloquent than me in speech
Therefor send him with me as a helper to confirm me
Lo I fear that they will give the lie to me
He said We will strengthen thine arm with thy brother and We will give unto you both power so that they cannot reach you for Our portents
Ye twain and those who follow you will be the winners
But when Moses came unto them with Our clear tokens they said This is naught but invented magic
We never heard of this among our fathers of old
And Moses said My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance from His presence and whose will be the sequel of the Home of bliss
Lo wrongdoers will not be successful
And Pharaoh said O chiefs
I know not that ye have a god other than me so kindle for me a fire O Haman to bake the mud and set up for me a lofty tower in order that I may survey the god of Moses and lo
I deem him of the liars
And he and his hosts were haughty in the land without right and deemed that they would never be brought back to Us
Therefor We seized him and his hosts and abandoned them unto the sea
Behold the nature of the consequence for evildoers
And We made them patterns that invite unto the Fire and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped
And We made a curse to follow them in this world and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the hateful
And We verily gave the Scripture unto Moses after We had destroyed the generations of old clear testimonies for mankind and a guidance and a mercy that haply they might reflect
And thou Muhammad wast not on the western side of the Mount when We expounded unto Moses the commandment and thou wast not among those present
But We brought forth generations and their lives dragged on for them
And thou wast not a dweller in Midian reciting unto them Our revelations but We kept sending messengers to men
And thou was not beside the Mount when We did call but the knowledge of it is a mercy from thy Lord that thou mayst warn a folk unto whom no warner came before thee that haply they may give heed
Otherwise if disaster should afflict them because of that which their own hands have sent before them they might say Our Lord
Why sentest Thou no messenger unto us that we might have followed Thy revelations and been of the believers
But when there came unto them the Truth from Our presence they said Why is he not given the like of what was given unto Moses
Did they not disbelieve in that which was given unto Moses of old
They say Two magics that support each other and they say Lo in both we are disbelievers
Say unto them O Muhammad Then bring a scripture from the presence of Allah that giveth clearer guidance than these two that I may follow it if ye are truthful
And if they answer thee not then know that what they follow is their lusts
And who goeth farther astray than he who followeth his lust without guidance from Allah
Lo Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
And now verily We have caused the Word to reach them that haply they may give heed
Those unto whom We gave the Scripture before it they believe in it
And when it is recited unto them they say We believe in it
Lo it is the Truth from our Lord
Lo even before it we were of those who surrender unto Him
These will be given their reward twice over because they are steadfast and repel evil with good and spend of that wherewith We have provided them
And when they hear vanity they withdraw from it and say Unto us our works and unto you your works
Peace be unto you
We desire not the ignorant
Lo thou O Muhammad guidest not whom thou lovest but Allah guideth whom He will
And He is Best Aware of those who walk aright
And they say If we were to follow the Guidance with thee we should be torn out of our land
Have We not established for them a sure sanctuary whereunto the produce of all things is brought in trade a provision from Our presence
But most of them know not
And how many a community have We destroyed that was thankless for its means of livelihood
And yonder are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them save a little
And We even We were the inheritors
And never did thy Lord destroy the townships till He had raised up in their mother town a messenger reciting unto them Our revelations
And never did We destroy the townships unless the folk thereof were evildoers
And whatsoever ye have been given is a comfort of the life of the world and an ornament thereof and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting
Have ye then no sense
Is he whom We have promised a fair promise which he will find true like him whom We suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned
On the day when He will call unto them and say Where are My partners whom ye imagined
Those concerning whom the Word will have come true will say Our Lord
These are they whom we led astray
We led them astray even as we ourselves were astray
We declare our innocence before Thee us they never worshipped
And it will be said Cry unto your socalled partners of Allah
And they will cry unto them and they will give no answer unto them and they will see the Doom
Ah if they had but been guided
And on the Day when He will call unto them and say What answer gave ye to the messengers
On that day all tidings will be dimmed for them nor will they ask one of another
But as for him who shall repent and believe and do right he haply may be one of the successful
Thy Lord bringeth to pass what He willeth and chooseth
They have never any choice
Glorified be Allah and Exalted above all that they associate with Him
And thy Lord knoweth what their breasts conceal and what they publish
And He is Allah there is no Allah save Him
His is all praise in the former and the latter state and His is the command and unto Him ye will be brought back
Say Have ye thought if Allah made night everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection who is a god beside Allah who could bring you light
Will ye not then hear
Say Have ye thought if Allah made day everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection who is a god beside Allah who could bring you night wherein ye rest
Will ye not then see
Of His mercy hath He appointed for you night and day that therein ye may rest and that ye may seek His bounty and that haply ye may be thankful
And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say Where are My partners whom ye pretended
And We shall take out from every nation a witness and We shall say Bring your proof
Then they will know that Allah hath the Truth and all that they invented will have failed them
Now Korah was of Moses folk but he oppressed them and We gave him so much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of mighty men
When his own folk said unto him Exult not lo
Allah loveth not the exultant
But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which Allah hath given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world and be thou kind even as Allah hath been kind to thee and seek not corruption in the earth lo Allah loveth not corrupters
He said I have been given it only on account of knowledge I possess
Knew he not that Allah had destroyed already of the generations before him men who were mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following
The guilty are not questioned of their sins
Then went he forth before his people in his pomp
Those who were desirous of the life of the world said Ah would that we had the like of what hath been given unto Korah
Lo he is lord of rare good fortune
But those who had been given knowledge said Woe unto you
The reward of Allah for him who believeth and doeth right is better and only the steadfast will obtain it
So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwellingplace
Then he had no host to help him against Allah nor was he of those who can save themselves
And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying Ah welladay Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and straiteneth it for whom He will
If Allah had not been gracious unto us He would have caused it to swallow us also
Ah welladay the disbelievers never prosper
As for that Abode of the Hereafter We assign it unto those who seek not oppression in the earth nor yet corruption
The sequel is for those who ward off evil
Whoso bringeth a good deed he will have better than the same while as for him who bringeth an illdeed those who do illdeeds will be requited only what they did
Lo He Who hath given thee the Qur an for a law will surely bring thee home again
Say My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in error manifest
Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee but it is a mercy from thy Lord so never be a helper to the disbelievers
And let them not divert thee from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down unto thee but call mankind unto thy Lord and be not of those who ascribe partners unto Him
And cry not unto any other god along with Allah
There is no Allah save Him
Everything will perish save His countenance
His is the command and unto Him ye will be brought back
Alif
Lam
Mim
Do men imagine that they will be left at ease because they say We believe and will not be tested with affliction
Lo We tested those who were before you
Thus Allah knoweth those who are sincere and knoweth those who feign
Or do those who do illdeeds imagine that they can outstrip Us
Evil for them is that which they decide
Whoso looketh forward to the meeting with Allah let him know that Allah s reckoning is surely nigh and He is the Hearer the Knower
And whosoever striveth striveth only for himself for lo
Allah is altogether Independent of His creatures
And as for those who believe and do good works We shall remit from them their evil deeds and shall repay them the best that they did
We have enjoined on man kindness to parents but if they strive to make thee join with Me that of which thou hast no knowledge then obey them not
Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what ye used to do
And as for those who believe and do good works We verily shall make them enter in among the righteous
Of mankind is he who saith We believe in Allah but if he be made to suffer for the sake of Allah he mistaketh the persecution of mankind for Allah s punishment and then if victory cometh from thy Lord will say Lo we were with you all the while
Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the bosoms of His creatures
Verily Allah knoweth those who believe and verily He knoweth the hypocrites
Those who disbelieve say unto those who believe Follow our way of religion and we verily will bear your sins for you
They cannot bear aught of their sins
Lo they verily are liars
But they verily will bear their own loads and other loads beside their own and they verily will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which they invented
And verily we sent Noah as Our messenger unto his folk and he continued with them for a thousand years save fifty years and the flood engulfed them for they were wrongdoers
And We rescued him and those with him in the ship and made of it a portent for the peoples
And Abraham
Remember when he said unto his folk Serve Allah and keep your duty unto Him that is better for you if ye did but know
Ye serve instead of Allah only idols and ye only invent a lie
Lo those whom ye serve instead of Allah own no provision for you
So seek your provision from Allah and serve Him and give thanks unto Him for unto Him ye will be brought back
But if ye deny then nations have denied before you
The messenger is only to convey the message plainly
See they not how Allah produceth creation then reproduceth it
Lo for Allah that is easy
Say O Muhammad Travel in the land and see how He originated creation then Allah bringeth forth the later growth Lo
Allah is Able to do all things
He punisheth whom He will and showeth mercy unto whom He will and unto Him ye will be turned
Ye cannot escape from Him in the earth or in the sky and beside Allah there is for you no friend or helper
Those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and in their Meeting with Him such have no hope of My mercy
For such there is a painful doom
But the answer of his folk was only that they said Kill him or Burn him
Then Allah saved him from the Fire
Lo herein verily are portents for folk who believe
He said Ye have chosen only idols instead of Allah
The love between you is only in the life of the world
Then on the Day of Resurrection ye will deny each other and curse each other and your abode will be the Fire and ye will have no helpers
And Lot believed him and said Lo
I am a fugitive unto my Lord Lo
He only He is the Mighty the Wise
And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob and We established the prophethood and the Scripture among his seed and We gave him his reward in the world and lo in the Hereafter he verily is among the righteous
And Lot
Remember when he said unto his folk Lo ye commit lewdness such as no creature did before you
For come ye not in unto males and cut ye not the road for travellers and commit ye not abomination in your meetings
But the answer of his folk was only that they said Bring Allah s doom upon us if thou art a truthteller
He said My Lord
Give me victory over folk who work corruption
And when Our messengers brought Abraham the good news they said Lo we are about to destroy the people of that township for its people are wrongdoers
He said Lo
Lot is there
They said We are best aware of who is there
We are to deliver him and his household all save his wife who is of those who stay behind
And when Our messengers came unto Lot he was troubled upon their account for he could not protect them but they said Fear not nor grieve Lo we are to deliver thee and thy household all save thy wife who is of those who stay behind
Lo We are about to bring down upon the folk of this township a fury from the sky because they are evillivers
And verily of that We have left a clear sign for people who have sense
And unto Midian We sent Shu eyb their brother
He said O my people
Serve Allah and look forward to the Last Day and do not evil making mischief in the earth
But they denied him and the dreadful earthquake took them and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling place
And the tribes of A ad and Thamud
Their fate is manifest unto you from their ruined and deserted dwellings
Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them and so debarred them from the Way though they were keen observers
And Korah Pharaoh and Haman
Moses came unto them with clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty but they were boastful in the land And they were not winners in the race
So We took each one in his sin of them was he on whom We sent a hurricane and of them was he who was overtaken by the Awful Cry and of them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow and of them was he whom We drowned
It was not for Allah to wrong them but they wronged themselves
The likeness of those who choose other patrons than Allah is as the likeness of the spider when she taketh unto herself a house and lo the frailest of all houses is the spider s house if they but knew
Lo Allah knoweth what thing they invoke instead of Him
He is the Mighty the Wise
As for these similitudes We coin them for mankind but none will grasp their meaning save the wise
Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth
Lo therein is indeed a portent for believers
Recite that which hath been inspired in thee of the Scripture and establish worship
Lo worship preserveth from lewdness and iniquity but verily remembrance of Allah is more important
And Allah knoweth what ye do
And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be in a way that is better save with such of them as do wrong and say We believe in that which hath been revealed unto us and revealed unto you our Allah and your Allah is One and unto Him we surrender
In like manner We have revealed unto thee the Scripture and those unto whom We gave the Scripture aforetime will believe therein and of these also there are some who believe therein
And none deny Our revelations save the disbelievers
And thou O Muhammad wast not a reader of any scripture before it nor didst thou write it with thy right hand for then might those have doubted who follow falsehood
But it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge and none deny Our revelations save wrongdoers
And they say Why are not portents sent down upon him from his Lord
Say Portents are with Allah only and I am but a plain warner
Is it not enough for them that We have sent down unto thee the Scripture which is read unto them
Lo herein verily is mercy and a reminder for folk who believe
Say unto them O Muhammad Allah sufficeth for witness between me and you
He knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth
And those who believe in vanity and disbelieve in Allah they it is who are the losers
They bid thee hasten on the doom of Allah
And if a term had not been appointed the doom would assuredly have come unto them ere now
And verily it will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not
They bid thee hasten on the doom when lo hell verily will encompass the disbelievers
On the day when the doom will overwhelm them from above them and from underneath their feet and He will say Taste what ye used to do
O my bondmen who believe
Lo My earth is spacious
Therefor serve Me only
Every soul will taste of death
Then unto Us ye will be returned
Those who believe and do good works them verily We shall house in lofty dwellings of the Garden underneath which rivers flow
There they will dwell secure
How sweet the guerdon of the toilers
Who persevere and put their trust in their Lord
And how many an animal there is that beareth not its own provision
Allah provideth for it and for you
He is the Hearer the Knower
And if thou wert to ask them Who created the heavens and the earth and constrained the sun and the moon to their appointed work they would say Allah
How then are they turned away
Allah maketh the provision wide for whom He will of His bondmen and straiteneth it for whom He will
Lo Allah is Aware of all things
And if thou wert to ask them Who causeth water to come down from the sky and therewith reviveth the earth after its death they verily would say Allah
Say Praise be to Allah
But most of them have no sense
This life of the world is but a pastime and a game
Lo the home of the Hereafter that is Life if they but knew
And when they mount upon the ships they pray to Allah making their faith pure for Him only but when He bringeth them safe to land behold they ascribe partners unto Him
That they may disbelieve in that which We have given them and that they may take their ease
But they will come to know
Have they not seen that We have appointed a sanctuary immune from violence while mankind are ravaged all around them
Do they then believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the bounty of Allah
Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah or denieth the truth when it cometh unto him
Is not there a home in hell for disbelievers
As for those who strive in Us We surely guide them to Our paths and lo
Allah is with the good
Alif
Lam
Mim
The Romans have been defeated
In the nearer land and they after their defeat will be victorious
Within ten years Allah s is the command in the former case and in the latter and in that day believers will rejoice
In Allah s help to victory
He helpeth to victory whom He will
He is the Mighty the Merciful
It is a promise of Allah
Allah faileth not His promise but most of mankind know not
They know only some appearance of the life of the world and are heedless of the Hereafter
Have they not pondered upon themselves Allah created not the heavens and the earth and that which is between them save with truth and for a destined end
But truly many of mankind are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord
Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them
They were stronger than these in power and they dug the earth and built upon it more than these have built
Messengers of their own came unto them with clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty
Surely Allah wronged them not but they did wrong themselves
Then evil was the consequence to those who dealt in evil because they denied the revelations of Allah and made a mock of them
Allah produceth creation then He reproduceth it then unto Him ye will be returned
And in the day when the Hour riseth the unrighteous will despair
There will be none to intercede for them of those whom they made equal with Allah
And they will reject their partners whom they ascribed unto Him
In the day when the Hour cometh in that day they will be sundered
As for those who believed and did good works they will be made happy in a Garden
But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations and denied the meeting of the Hereafter such will be brought to doom
So glory be to Allah when ye enter the night and when ye enter the morning
Unto Him be praise in the heavens and the earth and at the sun s decline and in the noonday
He bringeth forth the living from the dead and He bringeth forth the dead from the living and He reviveth the earth after her death
And even so will ye be brought forth
And of His signs is this He created you of dust and behold you human beings ranging widely
And of His signs is this He created for you helpmeets from yourselves that ye might find rest in them and He ordained between you love and mercy
Lo herein indeed are portents for folk who reflect
And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the difference of your languages and colours
Lo herein indeed are portents for men of knowledge
And of His signs is your slumber by night and by day and your seeking of His bounty
Lo herein indeed are portents for folk who heed
And of His signs is this He showeth you the lightning for a fear and for a hope and sendeth down water from the sky and thereby quickeneth the earth after her death
Lo herein indeed are portents for folk who understand
And of His signs is this The heavens and the earth stand fast by His command and afterward when He calleth you lo from the earth ye will emerge
Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth
All are obedient unto Him
He it is Who produceth creation then reproduceth it and it is easier for Him
His is the Sublime Similitude in the heavens and the earth
He is the Mighty the Wise
He coineth for you a similitude of yourselves Have ye from among those whom your right hands possess partners in the wealth We have bestowed upon you equal with you in respect thereof so that ye fear them as ye fear each other that ye ascribe unto Us partners out of that which We created
Thus We display the revelations for people who have sense
Nay but those who do wrong follow their own lusts without knowledge
Who is able to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray
For such there are no helpers
So set thy purpose O Muhammad for religion as a man by nature upright the nature framed of Allah in which He hath created man
There is no altering the laws of Allah s creation
That is the right religion but most men know not
Turning unto Him only and be careful of your duty unto Him and establish worship and be not of those who ascribe partners unto Him
Of those who split up their religion and became schismatics each sect exulting in its tenets
And when harm toucheth men they cry unto their Lord turning to Him in repentance then when they have tasted of His mercy behold some of them attribute partners to their Lord
So as to disbelieve in that which We have given them
Unto such it is said Enjoy yourselves awhile but ye will come to know
Or have We revealed unto them any warrant which speaketh of that which they associate with Him
And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy they rejoice therein but if an evil thing befall them as the consequence of their own deeds lo they are in despair
See they not that Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will and straiteneth it for whom He will
Lo herein indeed are portents for folk who believe
So give to the kinsman his due and to the needy and to the wayfarer
That is best for those who seek Allah s Countenance
And such are they who are successful
That which ye give in usury in order that it may increase on other people s property hath no increase with Allah but that which ye give in charity seeking Allah s Countenance hath increase manifold
Allah is He Who created you and then sustained you then causeth you to die then giveth life to you again
Is there any of your socalled partners of Allah that doeth aught of that
Praised and Exalted be He above what they associate with Him
Corruption doth appear on land and sea because of the evil which men s hands have done that He may make them taste a part of that which they have done in order that they may return
Say O Muhammad to the disbelievers Travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for those who were before you
Most of them were idolaters
So set thy purpose resolutely for the right religion before the inevitable day cometh from Allah
On that day mankind will be sundered
Whoso disbelieveth must then bear the consequences of his disbelief while those who do right make provision for themselves
That He may reward out of His bounty those who believe and do good works Lo
He loveth not the disbelievers in His guidance
And of His signs is this He sendeth herald winds to make you taste His mercy and that the ships may sail at His command and that ye may seek his favour and that haply ye may be thankful
Verily We sent before thee Muhammad messengers to their own folk
Then we took vengeance upon those who were guilty in regard to them
To help believers is ever incumbent upon Us
Allah is He Who sendeth the winds so that they raise clouds and spreadeth them along the sky as pleaseth Him and causeth them to break and thou seest the rain downpouring from within them
And when He maketh it to fall on whom He will of His bondmen lo they rejoice
Though before that even before it was sent down upon them they were in despair
Look therefore at the prints of Allah s mercy in creation how He quickeneth the earth after her death
Lo He verily is the Quickener of the Dead and He is Able to do all things
And if We sent a wind and they beheld it yellow they verily would still continue in their disbelief
For verily thou Muhammad canst not make the dead to hear nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee
Nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error
Thou canst make none to hear save those who believe in Our revelations so that they surrender unto Him
Allah is He Who shaped you out of weakness then appointed after weakness strength then after strength appointed weakness and grey hair
He createth what He will
He is the Knower the Mighty
And on the day when the Hour riseth the guilty will vow that they did tarry but an hour thus were they ever deceived
But those to whom knowledge and faith are given will say The truth is ye have tarried by Allah s decree until the Day of Resurrection
This is the Day of Resurrection but ye used not to know
In that day their excuses will not profit those who did injustice nor will they be allowed to make amends
Verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur an all kinds of similitudes and indeed if thou camest unto them with a miracle those who disbelieve would verily exclaim Ye are but tricksters
Thus doth Allah seal the hearts of those who know not
So have patience O Muhammad
Allah s promise is the very truth and let not those who have no certainty make thee impatient
Alif
Lam
Mim
These are revelations of the wise Scripture
A guidance and a mercy for the good
Those who establish worship and pay the poordue and have sure faith in the Hereafter
Such have guidance from their Lord
Such are the successful
And of mankind is he who payeth for mere pastime of discourse that he may mislead from Allah s way without knowledge and maketh it the butt of mockery
For such there is a shameful doom
And when Our revelations are recited unto him he turneth away in pride as if he heard them not as if there were a deafness in his ears
So give him tidings of a painful doom
Lo those who believe and do good works for them are the gardens of delight
Wherein they will abide
It is a promise of Allah in truth
He is the Mighty the Wise
He hath created the heavens without supports that ye can see and hath cast into the earth firm hills so that it quake not with you and He hath dispersed therein all kinds of beasts
And We send down water from the sky and We cause plants of every goodly kind to grow therein
This is the Creation of Allah
Now show me that which those ye worship beside Him have created
Nay but the wrongdoers are in error manifest
And verily We gave Luqman wisdom saying Give thanks unto Allah and whosoever giveth thanks he giveth thanks for the good of his soul
And whosoever refuseth Lo Allah is Absolute Owner of Praise
And remember when Luqman said unto his son when he was exhorting him O my dear son
Ascribe no partners unto Allah
Lo to ascribe partners unto Him is a tremendous wrong
And We have enjoined upon man concerning his partners His mother beareth him in weakness upon weakness and his weaning is in two years Give thanks unto Me and unto thy parents Unto Me is the journeying
But if they strive with thee to make thee ascribe unto Me as partner that of which thou hast no knowledge then obey them not
Consort with them in the world kindly and follow the path of him who repenteth unto Me
Then unto Me will be your return and I shall tell you what ye used to do
O my dear son
Lo though it be but the weight of a grain of mustardseed and though it be in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth Allah will bring it forth
Lo Allah is Subtile Aware
O my dear son
Establish worship and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity and persevere whatever may befall thee
Lo that is of the steadfast heart of things
Turn not thy cheek in scorn toward folk nor walk with pertness in the land
Lo Allah loveth not each braggart boaster
Be modest in thy bearing and subdue thy voice
Lo the harshest of all voices is the voice of the ass
See ye not how Allah hath made serviceable unto you whatsoever is in the skies and whatsoever is in the earth and hath loaded you with His favours both without and within
Yet of mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah without knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light
And if it be said unto them Follow that which Allah hath revealed they say Nay but we follow that wherein we found our fathers What
Even though the devil were inviting them unto the doom of flame
Whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good he verily hath grasped the firm handhold
Unto Allah belongeth the sequel of all things
And whosoever disbelieveth let not his disbelief afflict thee O Muhammad
Unto Us is their return and We shall tell them what they did Lo
Allah is Aware of what is in the breasts of men
We give them comfort for a little and then We drive them to a heavy doom
If thou shouldst ask them Who created the heavens and the earth they would answer Allah
Say Praise be to Allah
But most of them know not
Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth Lo
Allah He is the Absolute the Owner of Praise
And if all the trees in the earth were pens and the sea with seven more seas to help it were ink the words of Allah could not be exhausted
Lo Allah is Mighty Wise
Your creation and your raising from the dead are only as the creation and the raising of a single soul
Lo Allah is Hearer Knower
Hast thou not seen how Allah causeth the night to pass into the day and causeth the day to pass into the night and hath subdued the sun and the moon to do their work each running unto an appointed term and that Allah is Informed of what ye do
That is so because Allah He is the True and that which they invoke beside Him is the False and because Allah He is the Sublime the Great
Hast thou not seen how the ships glide on the sea by Allah s grace that He may show you of His wonders
Lo therein indeed are portents for every steadfast grateful heart
And if a wave enshroudeth them like awnings they cry unto Allah making their faith pure for Him only
But when He bringeth them safe to land some of them compromise
None denieth Our signs save every traitor ingrate
O mankind
Keep your duty to your Lord and fear a Day when the parent will not be able to avail the child in aught nor the child to avail the parent Lo
Allah s promise is the very truth
Let not the life of the world beguile you nor let the deceiver beguile you in regard to Allah
Allah With Him is knowledge of the Hour
He sendeth down the rain and knoweth that which is in the wombs
No soul knoweth what it will earn tomorrow and no soul knoweth in what land it will die
Lo Allah is Knower Aware
Alif
Lam
Mim
The revelation of the Scripture whereof there is no doubt is from the Lord of the Worlds
Or say they He hath invented it
Nay but it is the Truth from thy Lord that thou mayst warn a folk to whom no warner came before thee that haply they may walk aright
Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth and that which is between them in six Days
Then He mounted the Throne Ye have not beside Him a protecting friend or mediator
Will ye not then remember
He directeth the ordinance from the heaven unto the earth then it ascendeth unto Him in a Day whereof the measure is a thousand years of that ye reckon
Such is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible the Mighty the Merciful
Who made all things good which He created and He began the creation of man from clay
Then He made his seed from a draught of despised fluid
Then He fashioned him and breathed into him of His Spirit and appointed for you hearing and sight and hearts
Small thanks give ye
And they say When we are lost in the earth how can we then be recreated
Nay but they are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord
Say The angel of death who hath charge concerning you will gather you and afterward unto your Lord ye will be returned
Couldst thou but see when the guilty hang their heads before their Lord and say Our Lord
We have now seen and heard so send us back we will do right now we are sure
And if We had so willed We could have given every soul its guidance but the word from Me concerning evildoers took effect that I will fill hell with the jinn and mankind together
So taste the evil of your deeds Forasmuch as ye forgot the meeting of this your day lo
We forget you
Taste the doom of immortality because of what ye used to do
Only those believe in Our revelations who when they are reminded of them fall down prostrate and hymn the praise of their Lord and they are not scornful
Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope and spend of that We have bestowed on them
No soul knoweth what is kept hid for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do
Is he who is a believer like unto him who is an evilliver
They are not alike
But as for those who believe and do good works for them are the Gardens of Retreat a welcome in reward for what they used to do
And as for those who do evil their retreat is the Fire
Whenever they desire to issue forth from thence they are brought back thither Unto them it is said Taste the torment of the Fire which ye used to deny
And verily We make them taste the lower punishment before the greater that haply they may return
And who doth greater wrong than he who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord then turneth from them
Lo We shall requite the guilty
We verily gave Moses the Scripture so be not ye in doubt of his receiving it and We appointed it a guidance for the Children of Israel
And when they became steadfast and believed firmly in Our revelations We appointed from among them leaders who guided by Our command
Lo thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
Is it not a guidance for them to observe how many generations We destroyed before them amid whose dwelling places they do walk
Lo therein verily are portents
Will they not then heed
Have they not seen how We lead the water to the barren land and therewith bring forth crops whereof their cattle eat and they themselves
Will they not then see
And they say When cometh this victory of yours if ye are truthful
Say unto them On the day of the victory the faith of those who disbelieve and who then will believe will not avail them neither will they be reprieved
So withdraw from them O Muhammad and await the event
Lo they also are awaiting it
O Prophet
Keep thy duty to Allah and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites
Lo Allah is Knower Wise
And follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord
Lo Allah is Aware of what ye do
And put thy trust in Allah for Allah is sufficient as Trustee
Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body nor hath He made your wives whom ye declare to be your mothers your mothers nor hath He made those whom ye claim to be your sons your sons
This is but a saying of your mouths
But Allah saith the truth and He showeth the way
Proclaim their real parentage
That will be more equitable in the sight of Allah
And if ye know not their fathers then they are your brethren in the faith and your clients
And there is no sin for you in the mistakes that ye make unintentionally but what your hearts purpose that will be a sin for you
Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
The Prophet is closer to the believers than their selves and his wives are as their mothers
And the owners of kinship are closer one to another in the ordinance of Allah than other believers and the fugitives who fled from Mecca except that ye should do kindness to your friends
This is written in the Book of nature
And when We exacted a covenant from the prophets and from thee O Muhammad and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary
We took from them a solemn covenant
That He may ask the loyal of their loyalty And He hath prepared a painful doom for the unfaithful
O ye who believe
Remember Allah s favour unto you when there came against you hosts and We sent against them a great wind and hosts ye could not see
And Allah is ever Seer of what ye do
When they came upon you from above you and from below you and when eyes grew wild and hearts reached to the throats and ye were imagining vain thoughts concerning Allah
There were the believers sorely tried and shaken with a mighty shock
And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease were saying Allah and His messenger promised us naught but delusion
And when a party of them said O folk of Yathrib
There is no stand possible for you therefor turn back
And certain of them even sought permission of the Prophet saying Our homes lie open to the enemy
And they lay not open
They but wished to flee
If the enemy had entered from all sides and they had been exhorted to treachery they would have committed it and would have hesitated thereupon but little
And verily they had already sworn unto Allah that they would not turn their backs to the foe
An oath to Allah must be answered for
Say Flight will not avail you if ye flee from death or killing and then ye dwell in comfort but a little while
Say Who is he who can preserve you from Allah if He intendeth harm for you or intendeth mercy for you
They will not find that they have any friend or helper other than Allah
Allah already knoweth those of you who hinder and those who say unto their brethren Come ye hither unto us and they come not to the stress of battle save a little
Being sparing of their help to you believers
But when the fear cometh then thou Muhammad seest them regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who fainteth unto death
Then when the fear departeth they scald you with sharp tongues in their greed for wealth from the spoil
Such have not believed
Therefor Allah maketh their deeds fruitless
And that is easy for Allah
They hold that the clans have not retired for good and if the clans should advance again they would fain be in the desert with the wandering Arabs asking for the news of you and if they were among you they would not give battle save a little
Verily in the messenger of Allah ye have a good example for him who looketh unto Allah and the Last Day and remembereth Allah much
And when the true believers saw the clans they said This is that which Allah and His messenger promised us
Allah and His messenger are true
It did but confirm them in their faith and resignation
Of the believers are men who are true to that which they covenanted with Allah
Some of them have paid their vow by death in battle and some of them still are waiting and they have not altered in the least
That Allah may reward the true men for their truth and punish the hypocrites if He will or relent toward them if He will
Lo Allah is Forgiving Merciful
And Allah repulsed the disbelievers in their wrath they gained no good
Allah averted their attack from the believers
Allah is ever Strong Mighty
And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them down from their strongholds and cast panic into their hearts
Some ye slew and ye made captive some
And He caused you to inherit their land and their houses and their wealth and land ye have not trodden
Allah is ever Able to do all things
O Prophet
Say unto thy wives If ye desire the world s life and its adornment come I will content you and will release you with a fair release
But if ye desire Allah and His messenger and the abode of the Hereafter then lo Allah hath prepared for the good among you an immense reward
O ye wives of the Prophet
Whosoever of you committeth manifest lewdness the punishment for her will be doubled and that is easy for Allah
And whosoever of you is submissive unto Allah and His messenger and doeth right We shall give her her reward twice over and We have prepared for her a rich provision
O ye wives of the Prophet
Ye are not like any other women
If ye keep your duty to Allah then be not soft of speech lest he in whose heart is a disease aspire to you but utter customary speech
And stay in your houses
Bedizen not yourselves with the bedizenment of the Time of Ignorance
Be regular in prayer and pay the poordue and obey Allah and His messenger
Allah s wish is but to remove uncleanness far from you O Folk of the Household and cleanse you with a thorough cleansing
And bear in mind that which is recited in your houses of the revelations of Allah and wisdom
Lo Allah is Subtile Aware
Lo men who surrender unto Allah and women who surrender and men who believe and women who believe and men who obey and women who obey and men who speak the truth and women who speak the truth and men who persevere in righteousness and women who persevere and men who are humble and women who are humble and men who give alms and women who give alms and men who fast and women who fast and men who guard their modesty and women who guard their modesty and men who remember Allah much and women who remember Allah hath prepared for them forgiveness and a vast reward
And it becometh not a believing man or a believing woman when Allah and His messenger have decided an affair for them that they should after that claim any say in their affair and whoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger he verily goeth astray in error manifest
And when thou saidst unto him on whom Allah hath conferred favour and thou hast conferred favour Keep thy wife to thyself and fear Allah
And thou didst hide in thy mind that which Allah was to bring to light and thou didst fear mankind whereas Allah hath a better right that thou shouldst fear Him
So when Zeyd had performed that necessary formality of divorce from her We gave her unto thee in marriage so that henceforth there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons when the latter have performed the necessary formality of release from them
The commandment of Allah must be fulfilled
There is no reproach for the Prophet in that which Allah maketh his due
That was Allah s way with those who passed away of old and the commandment of Allah is certain destiny
Who delivered the messages of Allah and feared Him and feared none save Allah
Allah keepeth good account
Muhammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets and Allah is ever Aware of all things
O ye who believe
Remember Allah with much remembrance
And glorify Him early and late
He it is Who blesseth you and His angels bless you that He may bring you forth from darkness unto light and He is ever Merciful to the believers
Their salutation on the day when they shall meet Him will be Peace
And He hath prepared for them a goodly recompense
O Prophet Lo
We have sent thee as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner
And as a summoner unto Allah by His permission and as a lamp that giveth light
And announce unto the believers the good tidings that they will have great bounty from Allah
And incline not to the disbelievers and the hypocrites
Disregard their noxious talk and put thy trust in Allah
Allah is sufficient as Trustee
O ye who believe
If ye wed believing women and divorce them before ye have touched them then there is no period that ye should reckon
But content them and release them handsomely
O Prophet
Lo
We have made lawful unto thee thy wives unto whom thou hast paid their dowries and those whom thy right hand possesseth of those whom Allah hath given thee as spoils of war and the daughters of thine uncle on the father s side and the daughters of thine aunts on the father s side and the daughters of thine uncle on the mother s side and the daughters of thine aunts on the mother s side who emigrated with thee and a believing woman if she give herself unto the Prophet and the Prophet desire to ask her in marriage a privilege for thee only not for the rest of believers We are Aware of that which We enjoined upon them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess that thou mayst be free from blame for Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
Thou canst defer whom thou wilt of them and receive unto thee whom thou wilt and whomsoever thou desirest of those whom thou hast set aside temporarily it is no sin for thee to receive her again that is better that they may be comforted and not grieve and may all be pleased with what thou givest them Allah knoweth what is in your hearts O men and Allah is ever Forgiving Clement
It is not allowed thee to take other women henceforth nor that thou shouldst change them for other wives even though their beauty pleased thee save those whom thy right hand possesseth
And Allah is ever Watcher over all things
O Ye who believe
Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet for a meal without waiting for the proper time unless permission be granted you
But if ye are invited enter and when your meal is ended then disperse Linger not for conversation
Lo that would cause annoyance to the Prophet and he would be shy of asking you to go but Allah is not shy of the truth
And when ye ask of them the wives of the Prophet anything ask it of them from behind a curtain
That is purer for your hearts and for their hearts
And it is not for you to cause annoyance to the messenger of Allah nor that ye should ever marry his wives after him
Lo that in Allah s sight would be an enormity
Whether ye divulge a thing or keep it hidden lo Allah is ever Knower of all things
It is no sin for them thy wives to converse freely with their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or the sons of their sisters or of their own women or their slaves O women
Keep your duty to Allah Lo
Allah is ever Witness over all things
Lo Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet
O ye who believe
Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation
Lo those who malign Allah and His messenger Allah hath cursed them in the world and the Hereafter and hath prepared for them the doom of the disdained
And those who malign believing men and believing women undeservedly they bear the guilt of slander and manifest sin
O Prophet
Tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them when they go abroad
That will be better so that they may be recognised and not annoyed
Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease and the alarmists in the city do not cease We verily shall urge thee on against them then they will be your neighbours in it but a little while
Accursed they will be seized wherever found and slain with a fierce slaughter
That was the way of Allah in the case of those who passed away of old thou wilt not find for the way of Allah aught of power to change
Men ask thee of the Hour
Say The knowledge of it is with Allah only
What can convey the knowledge unto thee It may be that the Hour is nigh
Lo Allah hath cursed the disbelievers and hath prepared for them a flaming fire
Wherein they will abide for ever They will find then no protecting friend nor helper
On the day when their faces are turned over in the Fire they say Oh would that we had obeyed Allah and had obeyed His messenger
And they say Our Lord
Lo we obeyed our princes and great men and they misled us from the Way
Our Lord
Oh give them double torment and curse them with a mighty curse
O ye who believe
Be not as those who slandered Moses but Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged and he was well esteemed in Allah s sight
O ye who believe
Guard your duty to Allah and speak words straight to the point
He will adjust your works for you and will forgive you your sins
Whosoever obeyeth Allah and His messenger he verily hath gained a signal victory
Lo We offered the trust unto the heavens and the earth and the hills but they shrank from bearing it and were afraid of it
And man assumed it
Lo he hath proved a tyrant and a fool
So Allah punisheth hypocritical men and hypocritical women and idolatrous men and idolatrous women But Allah pardoneth believing men and believing women and Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
Praise be to Allah unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
His is the praise in the Hereafter and He is the Wise the Aware
He knoweth that which goeth into the earth and that which cometh forth from it and that descendeth from the heaven and that which ascendeth into it
He is the Merciful the Forgiving
Those who disbelieve say The Hour will never come unto us
Say Nay by my Lord but it is coming unto you surely
He is the Knower of the Unseen
Not an atom s weight or less than that or greater escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth but it is in a clear Record
That He may reward those who believe and do good works
For them is pardon and a rich provision
But those who strive against Our revelations challenging Us theirs will be a painful doom of wrath
Those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth and leadeth unto the path of the Mighty the Owner of Praise
Those who disbelieve say Shall we show you a man who will tell you that when ye have become dispersed in dust with most complete dispersal still even then ye will be created anew
Hath he invented a lie concerning Allah or is there in him a madness
Nay but those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are in torment and far error
Have they not observed what is before them and what is behind them of the sky and the earth
If We will We can make the earth swallow them or cause obliteration from the sky to fall on them
Lo herein surely is a portent for every slave who turneth to Allah repentant
And assuredly We gave David grace from Us saying O ye hills and birds echo his psalms of praise
And We made the iron supple unto him
Saying Make thou long coats of mail and measure the links thereof
And do ye right Lo
I am Seer of what ye do
And unto Solomon We gave the wind whereof the morning course was a month s journey and the evening course a month s journey and We caused the fount of copper to gush forth for him and We gave him certain of the jinn who worked before him by permission of his Lord
And such of them as deviated from Our command them We caused to taste the punishment of flaming Fire
They made for him what he willed synagogues and statues basins like wells and boilers built into the ground
Give thanks O House of David
Few of My bondmen are thankful
And when We decreed death for him nothing showed his death to them save a creeping creature of the earth which gnawed away his staff
And when he fell the jinn saw clearly how if they had known the Unseen they would not have continued in despised toil
There was indeed a sign for Sheba in their dwellingplace Two gardens on the right hand and the left as who should say Eat of the provision of your Lord and render thanks to Him
A fair land and an indulgent Lord
But they were froward so We sent on them the flood of Iram and in exchange for their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit the tamarisk and here and there a lotetree
This We awarded them because of their ingratitude
Punish We ever any save the ingrates
And We set between them and the towns which We had blessed towns easy to be seen and We made the stage between them easy saying Travel in them safely both by night and day
But they said Our Lord
Make the stage between our journeys longer And they wronged themselves therefore We made them bywords in the land and scattered them abroad a total scattering
Lo herein verily are portents for each steadfast grateful heart
And Satan indeed found his calculation true concerning them for they follow him all save a group of true believers
And he had no warrant whatsoever against them save that We would know him who believeth in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt thereof and thy Lord O Muhammad taketh note of all things
Say O Muhammad Call upon those whom ye set up beside Allah
They possess not an atom s weight either in the heavens or in the earth nor have they any share in either nor hath He an auxiliary among them
No intercession availeth with Him save for him whom He permitteth
Yet when fear is banished from their hearts they say What was it that your Lord said They say The Truth
And He is the Sublime the Great
Say Who giveth you provision from the sky and the earth
Say Allah Lo we or you assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest
Say Ye will not be asked of what we committed nor shall we be asked of what ye do
Say Our Lord will bring us all together then He will judge between us with truth
He is the Allknowing Judge
Say Show me those whom ye have joined unto Him as partners
Nay ye dare not
For He is Allah the Mighty the Wise
And We have not sent thee O Muhammad save as a bringer of good tidings and a warner unto all mankind but most of mankind know not
And they say When is this promise to be fulfilled if ye are truthful
Say O Muhammad Yours is the promise of a Day which ye cannot postpone nor hasten by an hour
And those who disbelieve say We believe not in this Qur an nor in that which was before it but oh if thou couldst see when the wrongdoers are brought up before their Lord how they cast the blame one to another how those who were despised in the earth say unto those who were proud But for you we should have been believers
Those who were proud say unto those who were despised Did we drive you away from the guidance after it had come unto you
Nay but ye were guilty
Those who were despised say unto those who were proud Nay but it was your scheming night and day when ye commanded us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals unto Him
And they are filled with remorse when they behold the doom and We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved
Are they requited aught save what they used to do
And We sent not unto any township a warner but its pampered ones declared Lo we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent
And they say We are more than you in wealth and children We are not the punished
Say O Muhammad Lo my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will and narroweth it for whom He will
But most of mankind know not
And it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near unto Us but he who believeth and doeth good he draweth near
As for such theirs will be twofold reward for what they did and they will dwell secure in lofty halls
And as for those who strive against Our revelations challenging they will be brought to the doom
Say Lo my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His bondmen and narroweth it for him
And whatsoever ye spend for good He replaceth it
And He is the Best of Providers
And on the day when He will gather them all together He will say unto the angels Did these worship you
They will say Be Thou Glorified
Thou alone art our Guardian not them
Nay but they worshipped the jinn most of them were believers in them
That day ye will possess no use nor hurt one for another
And We shall say unto those who did wrong Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny
And if Our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms they say This is naught else than a man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to worship and they say This is naught else than an invented lie
Those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them This is naught else than mere magic
And We have given them no scriptures which they study nor sent We unto them before thee any warner
Those before them denied and these have not attained a tithe of that which We bestowed on them of old yet they denied My messengers
How intense then was My abhorrence of them
Say unto them O Muhammad I exhort you unto one thing only that ye awake for Allah s sake by twos and singly and then reflect There is no madness in your comrade
He is naught else than a warner unto you in face of a terrific doom
Say Whatever reward I might have asked of you is yours
My reward is the affair of Allah only
He is Witness over all things
Say Lo my Lord hurleth the truth
He is the Knower of Things Hidden
Say The Truth hath come and falsehood showeth not its face and will not return
Say If I err I err only to my own loss and if I am rightly guided it is because of that which my Lord hath revealed unto me Lo
He is Hearer Nigh
Couldst thou but see when they are terrified with no escape and are seized from near at hand
And say We now believe therein
But how can they reach faith from afar off
When they disbelieved in it of yore They aim at the unseen from afar off
And a gulf is set between them and that which they desire as was done for people of their kind of old
Lo they were in hopeless doubt
Praise be to Allah the Creator of the heavens and the earth Who appointeth the angels messengers having wings two three and four
He multiplieth in creation what He will
Lo Allah is Able to do all things
That which Allah openeth unto mankind of mercy none can withhold it and that which He withholdeth none can release thereafter
He is the Mighty the Wise
O mankind
Remember Allah s grace toward you
Is there any creator other than Allah who provideth for you from the sky and the earth
There is no Allah save Him
Whither then are ye turned
And if they deny thee O Muhammad messengers of Allah were denied before thee
Unto Allah all things are brought back
O mankind
Lo the promise of Allah is true
So let not the life of the world beguile you and let not the avowed beguiler beguile you with regard to Allah
Lo the devil is an enemy for you so treat him as an enemy
He only summoneth his faction to be owners of the flaming Fire
Those who disbelieve theirs will be an awful doom and those who believe and do good works theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward
Is he the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it good other than Satan s dupe
Allah verily sendeth whom He will astray and guideth whom He will so let not thy soul expire in sighings for them Lo
Allah is Aware of what they do
And Allah it is Who sendeth the winds and they raise a cloud then We lead it unto a dead land and revive therewith the earth after its death
Such is the Resurrection
Whoso desireth power should know that all power belongeth to Allah
Unto Him good words ascend and the pious deed doth He exalt but those who plot iniquities theirs will be an awful doom and the plotting of such folk will come to naught
Allah created you from dust then from a little fluid then He made you pairs the male and female
No female beareth or bringeth forth save with His knowledge
And noone groweth old who groweth old nor is aught lessened of his life but it is recorded in a Book Lo that is easy for Allah
And the two seas are not alike this fresh sweet good to drink this other bitter salt
And from them both ye eat fresh meat and derive the ornament that ye wear
And thou seest the ship cleaving them with its prow that ye may seek of His bounty and that haply ye may give thanks
He maketh the night to pass into the day and He maketh the day to pass into the night
He hath subdued the sun and moon to service
Each runneth unto an appointed term
Such is Allah your Lord His is the Sovereignty and those unto whom ye pray instead of Him own not so much as the white spot on a datestone
If ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer and if they heard they could not grant it you
On the Day of Resurrection they will disown association with you
None can inform you like Him Who is Aware
O mankind
Ye are the poor in your relation to Allah
And Allah He is the Absolute the Owner of Praise
If He will He can be rid of you and bring instead of you some new creation
That is not a hard thing for Allah
And no burdened soul can bear another s burden and if one heavy laden crieth for help with his load naught of it will be lifted even though he unto whom he crieth be of kin
Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in secret and have established worship
He who groweth in goodness groweth only for himself he cannot by his merit redeem others
Unto Allah is the journeying
The blind man is not equal with the seer
Nor is darkness tantamount to light
Nor is the shadow equal with the sun s full heat
Nor are the living equal with the dead
Lo Allah maketh whom He will to hear
Thou canst not reach those who are in the graves
Thou art but a warner
Lo We have sent thee with the Truth a bearer of glad tidings and a warner and there is not a nation but a warner hath passed among them
And if they deny thee those before them also denied Their messengers came unto them with clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty and with the Psalms and the Scripture giving light
Then seized I those who disbelieved and how intense was My abhorrence
Hast thou not seen that Allah causeth water to fall from the sky and We produce therewith fruit of divers hues and among the hills are streaks white and red of divers hues and others ravenblack
And of men and beasts and cattle in like manner divers hues
The erudite among His bondmen fear Allah alone
Lo Allah is Mighty Forgiving
Lo those who read the Scripture of Allah and establish worship and spend of that which We have bestowed on them secretly and openly they look forward to imperishable gain
That He will pay them their wages and increase them of His grace
Lo He is Forgiving Responsive
As for that which We inspire in thee of the Scripture it is the Truth confirming that which was revealed before it
Lo Allah is indeed Observer Seer of His slaves
Then We gave the Scripture as inheritance unto those whom We elected of Our bondmen
But of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some who are lukewarm and of them are some who outstrip others through good deeds by Allah s leave
That is the great favour
Gardens of Eden They enter them wearing armlets of gold and pearl and their raiment therein is silk
And they say Praise be to Allah Who hath put grief away from us
Lo Our Lord is Forgiving Bountiful
Who of His grace hath installed us in the mansion of eternity where toil toucheth us not nor can weariness affect us
But as for those who disbelieve for them is fire of hell it taketh not complete effect upon them so that they can die nor is its torment lightened for them
Thus We punish every ingrate
And they cry for help there saying Our Lord
Release us we will do right not the wrong that we used to do
Did not We grant you a life long enough for him who reflected to reflect therein
And the warner came unto you
Now taste the flavour of your deeds for evildoers have no helper
Lo Allah is the Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth
Lo He is Aware of the secret of men s breasts
He it is Who hath made you regents in the earth so he who disbelieveth his disbelief be on his own head
Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers in their Lord s sight naught save abhorrence
Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers naught save loss
Say Have ye seen your partnergods to whom ye pray beside Allah
Show me what they created of the earth
Or have they any portion in the heavens
Or have We given them a scripture so they act on clear proof therefrom
Nay the evildoers promise one another only to deceive
Lo Allah graspeth the heavens and the earth that they deviate not and if they were to deviate there is not one that could grasp them after Him
Lo He is ever Clement Forgiving
And they swore by Allah their most binding oath that if a warner came unto them they would be more tractable than any of the nations yet when a warner came unto them it aroused in them naught save repugnance
Shown in their behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil and the evil plot encloseth but the men who make it
Then can they expect aught save the treatment of the folk of old
Thou wilt not find for Allah s way of treatment any substitute nor wilt thou find for Allah s way of treatment aught of power to change
Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them and they were mightier than these in power
Allah is not such that aught in the heavens or in the earth escapeth Him
Lo He is the Wise the Mighty
If Allah took mankind to task by that which they deserve He would not leave a living creature on the surface of the earth but He reprieveth them unto an appointed term and when their term cometh then verily they will know that Allah is ever Seer of His slaves
Ya Sin
By the wise Qur an
Lo thou art of those sent
On a straight path
A revelation of the Mighty the Merciful
That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned so they are heedless
Already hath the judgment for their infidelity proved true of most of them for they believe not
Lo We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins so that they are made stiffnecked
And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them and thus have covered them so that they see not
Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is alike for them for they believe not
Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the Beneficent in secret
To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward
We it is Who bring the dead to life We record that which they send before them and their footprints
And all things We have kept in a clear Register
Coin for them a similitude The people of the city when those sent from Allah came unto them
When We sent unto them twain and they denied them both so We reinforced them with a third and they said Lo we have been sent unto you
They said Ye are but mortals like unto us
The Beneficent hath naught revealed
Ye do but lie
They answered Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you
And our duty is but plain conveyance of the message
The people of the city said We augur ill of you
If ye desist not we shall surely stone you and grievous torture will befall you at our hands
They said Your evil augury be with you
Is it because ye are reminded of the truth
Nay but ye are froward folk
And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running He cried O my people
Follow those who have been sent
Follow those who ask of you no fee and who are rightly guided
For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me and unto Whom ye will be brought back
Shall I take other gods in place of Him when if the Beneficent should wish me any harm their intercession will avail me naught nor can they save
Then truly I should be in error manifest
Lo I have believed in your Lord so hear me
It was said unto him Enter paradise
He said Would that my people knew
With what munificence my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the honoured ones
We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven nor do We ever send
It was but one Shout and lo they were extinct
Ah the anguish for the bondmen
Never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them which indeed returned not unto them
But all without exception will be brought before Us
A token unto them is the dead earth
We revive it and We bring forth from it grain so that they eat thereof
And We have placed therein gardens of the datepalm and grapes and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein
That they may eat of the fruit thereof and their hands made it not
Will they not then give thanks
Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs of that which the earth groweth and of themselves and of that which they know not
A token unto them is night
We strip it of the day and lo they are in darkness
And the sun runneth on unto a restingplace for him
That is the measuring of the Mighty the Wise
And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palmleaf
It is not for the sun to overtake the moon nor doth the night outstrip the day
They float each in an orbit
And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship
And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride
And if We will We drown them and there is no help for them neither can they be saved
Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while
When it is said unto them Beware of that which is before you and that which is behind you that haply ye may find mercy they are heedless
Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them but they did turn away from it
And when it is said unto them Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided you those who disbelieve say unto those who believe Shall we feed those whom Allah if He willed would feed
Ye are in naught else than error manifest
And they say When will this promise be fulfilled if ye are truthful
They await but one Shout which will surprise them while they are disputing
Then they cannot make bequest nor can they return to their own folk
And the trumpet is blown and lo from the graves they hie unto their Lord
Crying Woe upon us
Who hath raised us from our place of sleep
This is that which the Beneficent did promise and the messengers spoke truth
It is but one Shout and behold them brought together before Us
This day no soul is wronged in aught nor are ye requited aught save what ye used to do
Lo those who merit paradise this day are happily employed
They and their wives in pleasant shade on thrones reclining
Theirs the fruit of their good deeds and theirs all that they ask
The word from a Merciful Lord for them is Peace
But avaunt ye O ye guilty this day
Did I not charge you O ye sons of Adam that ye worship not the devil Lo he is your open foe
But that ye worship Me
That was the right path
Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude
Had ye then no sense
This is hell which ye were promised if ye followed him
Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved
This day We seal up their mouths and their hands speak out to Us and their feet bear witness as to what they used to earn
And had We willed We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that they should struggle for the way
Then how could they have seen
And had We willed We verily could have fixed them in their place making them powerless to go forward or turn back
He whom we bring unto old age We reverse him in creation making him go back to weakness after strength
Have ye then no sense
And We have not taught him Muhammad poetry nor is it meet for him
This is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain
To warn whosoever liveth and that the word may be fulfilled against the disbelievers
Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the cattle so that they are their owners
And have subdued them unto them so that some of them they have for riding some for food
Benefits and divers drinks have they from them
Will they not then give thanks
And they have taken other gods beside Allah in order that they may be helped
It is not in their power to help them but they the worshippers are unto them a host in arms
So let not their speech grieve thee O Muhammad
Lo We know what they conceal and what proclaim
Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed
Yet lo he is an open opponent
And he hath coined for Us a similitude and hath forgotten the fact of his creation saying Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away
Say He will revive them Who produced them at the first for He is Knower of every creation
Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree and behold ye kindle from it
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of them
Aye that He is for He is the AllWise Creator
But His command when He intendeth a thing is only that He saith unto it Be and it is
Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things
Unto Him ye will be brought back
By those who set the ranks in battle order
And those who drive away the wicked with reproof
And those who read the Word for a reminder
Lo thy Lord is surely One
Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them and Lord of the sun s risings
Lo We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament the planets
With security from every froward devil
They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side
Outcast and theirs is a perpetual torment
Save him who snatcheth a fragment and there pursueth him a piercing flame
Then ask them O Muhammad Are they stronger as a creation or those others whom we have created
Lo We created them of plastic clay
Nay but thou dost marvel when they mock
And heed not when they are reminded
And seek to scoff when they behold a portent
And they say Lo this is mere magic
When we are dead and have become dust and bones shall we then forsooth be raised again
And our forefathers
Say O Muhammad Ye in truth and ye will be brought low
There is but one Shout and lo they behold
And say Ah woe for us
This is the Day of Judgment
This is the Day of Separation which ye used to deny
And it is said unto the angels Assemble those who did wrong together with their wives and what they used to worship
Instead of Allah and lead them to the path to hell
And stop them for they must be questioned
What aileth you that ye help not one another
Nay but this day they make full submission
And some of them draw near unto others mutually questioning
They say Lo ye used to come unto us imposing swearing that ye spoke the truth
They answer Nay but ye yourselves were not believers
We had no power over you but ye were wayward folk
Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us
Lo we are about to taste the doom
Thus we misled you
Lo we were ourselves astray
Then lo this day they both are sharers in the doom
Lo thus deal We with the guilty
For when it was said unto them There is no Allah save Allah they were scornful
And said Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet
Nay but he brought the Truth and he confirmed those sent before him
Lo now verily ye taste the painful doom
Ye are requited naught save what ye did
Save singleminded slaves of Allah
For them there is a known provision
Fruits
And they will be honoured
In the Gardens of delight
On couches facing one another
A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them
White delicious to the drinkers
Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby
And with them are those of modest gaze with lovely eyes
Pure as they were hidden eggs of the ostrich
And some of them draw near unto others mutually questioning
A speaker of them saith Lo I had a comrade
Who used to say Art thou in truth of those who put faith in his words
Can we when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones can we then verily be brought to book
He saith Will ye look
Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell
He saith By Allah thou verily didst all but cause my ruin
And had it not been for the favour of my Lord I too had been of those haled forth to doom
Are we then not to die
Saving our former death and are we not to be punished
Lo this is the supreme triumph
For the like of this then let the workers work
Is this better as a welcome or the tree of Zaqqum
Lo We have appointed it a torment for wrongdoers
Lo it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell
Its crop is as it were the heads of devils
And lo they verily must eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith
And afterward lo thereupon they have a drink of boiling water
And afterward lo their return is surely unto hell
They indeed found their fathers astray
But they make haste to follow in their footsteps
And verily most of the men of old went astray before them
And verily We sent among them warners
Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned
Save singleminded slaves of Allah
And Noah verily prayed unto Us and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer
And We saved him and his household from the great distress
And made his seed the survivors
And left for him among the later folk the salutation
Peace be unto Noah among the peoples
Lo thus do We reward the good
Lo he is one of Our believing slaves
Then We did drown the others
And lo of his persuasion verily was Abraham
When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart
When he said unto his father and his folk What is it that ye worship
Is it a falsehood gods beside Allah that ye desire
What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds
And he glanced a glance at the stars
Then said Lo I feel sick
And they turned their backs and went away from him
Then turned he to their gods and said Will ye not eat
What aileth you that ye speak not
Then he attacked them striking with his right hand
And his people came toward him hastening
He said Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve
When Allah hath created you and what ye make
They said Build for him a building and fling him in the redhotfire
And they designed a snare for him but We made them the undermost
And he said Lo
I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me
My Lord
Vouchsafe me of the righteous
So We gave him tidings of a gentle son
And when his son was old enough to walk with him Abraham said O my dear son I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee
So look what thinkest thou
He said O my father
Do that which thou art commanded
Allah willing thou shalt find me of the steadfast
Then when they had both surrendered to Allah and he had flung him down upon his face
We called unto him O Abraham
Thou hast already fulfilled the vision
Lo thus do We reward the good
Lo that verily was a clear test
Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim
And We left for him among the later folk the salutation
Peace be unto Abraham
Thus do We reward the good
Lo he is one of Our believing slaves
And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac a prophet of the righteous
And We blessed him and Isaac
And of their seed are some who do good and some who plainly wrong themselves
And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron
And saved them and their people from the great distress
And helped them so that they became the victors
And We gave them the clear Scripture
And showed them the right path
And We left for them among the later folk the salutation
Peace be unto Moses and Aaron
Lo thus do We reward the good
Lo they are two of Our believing slaves
And lo Elias was of those sent to warn
When he said unto his folk Will ye not ward off evil
Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators
Allah your Lord and Lord of your forefathers
But they denied him so they surely will be haled forth to the doom
Save singleminded slaves of Allah
And we left for him among the later folk the salutation
Peace be unto Elias
Lo thus do We reward the good
Lo he is one of our believing slaves
And lo Lot verily was of those sent to warn
When We saved him and his household every one
Save an old woman among those who stayed behind
Then We destroyed the others
And lo ye verily pass by the ruin of them in the morning
And at nighttime have ye then no sense
And lo Jonah verily was of those sent to warn
When he fled unto the laden ship
And then drew lots and was of those rejected
And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy
And had he not been one of those who glorify Allah
He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised
Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick
And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him
And We sent him to a hundred thousand folk or more
And they believed therefor We gave them comfort for a while
Now ask them O Muhammad Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have sons
Or created We the angels females while they were present
Lo it is of their falsehood that they say
Allah hath begotten
Allah verily they tell a lie
And again of their falsehood He hath preferred daughters to sons
What aileth you How judge ye
Will ye not then reflect
Or have ye a clear warrant
Then produce your writ if ye are truthful
And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought before Him
Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute unto Him
Save singleminded slaves of Allah
Lo verily ye and that which ye worship
Ye cannot excite anyone against Him
Save him who is to burn in hell
There is not one of us but hath his known position
Lo we even we are they who set the ranks
Lo we even we are they who hymn His praise
And indeed they used to say
If we had but a reminder from the men of old
We would be singleminded slaves of Allah
Yet now that it is come they disbelieve therein but they will come to know
And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent to warn
That they verily would be helped
And that Our host they verily would be the victors
So withdraw from them O Muhammad awhile
And watch for they will soon see
Would they hasten on Our doom
But when it cometh home to them then it will be a hapless morn for those who have been warned
Withdraw from them awhile
And watch for they will soon see
Glorified be thy Lord the Lord of Majesty from that which they attribute unto Him
And peace be unto those sent to warn
And praise be to Allah Lord of the Worlds
Sad
By the renowned Qur an
Nay but those who disbelieve are in false pride and schism
How many a generation We destroyed before them and they cried out when it was no longer the time for escape
And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come unto them and the disbelievers say This is a wizard a charlatan
Maketh he the gods One Allah
Lo that is an astounding thing
The chiefs among them go about exhorting Go and be staunch to your gods
Lo this is a thing designed
We have not heard of this in later religion
This is naught but an invention
Hath the reminder been unto him alone among us
Nay but they are in doubt concerning My reminder nay but they have not yet tasted My doom
Or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord the Mighty the Bestower
Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them theirs
Then let them ascend by ropes
A defeated host are all the factions that are there
The folk of Noah before them denied their messenger and so did the tribe of A ad and Pharaoh firmly planted
And the tribe of Thamud and the folk of Lot and the dwellers in the wood these were the factions
Not one of them but did deny the messengers therefor My doom was justified
These wait for but one Shout there will be no second thereto
They say Our Lord
Hasten on for us our fate before the Day of Reckoning
Bear with what they say and remember Our bondman David lord of might Lo he was ever turning in repentance toward Allah
Lo We subdued the hills to hymn the praises of their Lord with him at nightfall and sunrise
And the birds assembled all were turning unto Him
We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech
And hath the story of the litigants come unto thee
How they climbed the wall into the royal chamber
How they burst in upon David and he was afraid of them
They said Be not afraid
We are two litigants one of whom hath wronged the other therefor judge aright between us be not unjust and show us the fair way
Lo this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes while I had one ewe and he said Entrust it to me and he conquered me in speech
David said He hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe in addition to his ewes and lo many partners oppress one another save such as believe and do good works and they are few And David guessed that We had tried him and he sought forgiveness of his Lord and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented
So We forgave him that and lo he had access to Our presence and a happy journey s end
And it was said unto him O David Lo
We have set thee as a viceroy in the earth therefor judge aright between mankind and follow not desire that it beguile thee from the way of Allah
Lo those who wander from the way of Allah have an awful doom forasmuch as they forgot the Day of Reckoning
And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in vain
That is the opinion of those who disbelieve
And woe unto those who disbelieve from the Fire
Shall We treat those who believe and do good works as those who spread corruption in the earth or shall We treat the pious as the wicked
This is a Scripture that We have revealed unto thee full of blessing that they may ponder its revelations and that men of understanding may reflect
And We bestowed on David Solomon
How excellent a slave
Lo he was ever turning in repentance toward Allah
When there were shown to him at eventide lightfooted coursers
And he said Lo I have preferred the good things of the world to the remembrance of my Lord till they were taken out of sight behind the curtain
Then he said Bring them back to me and fell to slashing with his sword their legs and necks
And verily We tried Solomon and set upon his throne a mere body
Then did he repent
He said My Lord
Forgive me and bestow on me sovereignty such as shall not belong to any after me
Lo Thou art the Bestower
So We made the wind subservient unto him setting fair by his command whithersoever he intended
And the unruly every builder and diver made We subservient
And others linked together in chains
Saying This is Our gift so bestow thou or withhold without reckoning
And lo he hath favour with Us and a happy journey s end
And make mention O Muhammad of Our bondman Job when he cried unto his Lord saying Lo the devil doth afflict me with distress and torment
And it was said unto him Strike the ground with thy foot
This spring is a cool bath and a refreshing drink
And We bestowed on him again his household and therewith the like thereof a mercy from Us and a memorial for men of understanding
And it was said unto him Take in thine hand a branch and smite therewith and break not thine oath
Lo
We found him steadfast how excellent a slave
Lo he was ever turning in repentance to his Lord
And make mention of Our bondmen Abraham Isaac and Jacob men of parts and vision
Lo We purified them with a pure thought remembrance of the Home of the Hereafter
Lo in Our sight they are verily of the elect the excellent
And make mention of Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu lKifl
All are of the chosen
This is a reminder
And lo for those who ward off evil is a happy journey s end
Gardens of Eden whereof the gates are opened for them
Wherein reclining they call for plenteous fruit and cool drink that is therein
And with them are those of modest gaze companions
This it is that ye are promised for the Day of Reckoning
Lo this in truth is Our provision which will never waste away
This is for the righteous
And lo for the transgressors there with be an evil journey s end
Hell where they will burn an evil restingplace
Here is a boiling and an icecold draught so let them taste it
And other torment of the kind in pairs the two extremes
Here is an army rushing blindly with you
Those who are already in the Fire say No word of welcome for them
Lo they will roast at the Fire
They say Nay but you misleaders for you there is no word of welcome
Ye prepared this for us by your misleading
Now hapless is the plight
They say Our Lord
Whoever did prepare this for us oh give him double portion of the Fire
And they say What aileth us that we behold not men whom we were wont to count among the wicked
Did we take them wrongly for a laughingstock or have our eyes missed them
Lo that is very truth the wrangling of the dwellers in the Fire
Say unto them O Muhammad I am only a warner and there is no Allah save Allah the One the Absolute
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them the Mighty the Pardoning
Say It is tremendous tidings
Whence ye turn away
I had no knowledge of the Highest Chiefs when they disputed
It is revealed unto me only that I may be a plain warner
When thy Lord said unto the angels Lo I am about to create a mortal out of mire
And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit then fall down before him prostrate
The angels fell down prostrate every one
Saving Iblis he was scornful and became one of the disbelievers
He said O Iblis
What hindereth thee from falling prostrate before that which I have created with both My hands
Art thou too proud or art thou of the high exalted
He said I am better than him
Thou createdst me of fire whilst him Thou didst create of clay
He said Go forth from hence for lo thou art outcast
And lo My curse is on thee till the Day of Judgment
He said My Lord
Reprieve me till the day when they are raised
He said Lo thou art of those reprieved
Until the day of the time appointed
He said Then by Thy might I surely will beguile them every one
Save Thy singleminded slaves among them
He said The Truth is and the Truth I speak
That I shall fill hell with thee and with such of them as follow thee together
Say O Muhammad unto mankind I ask of you no fee for this and I am no simulating
Lo it is naught else than a reminder for all peoples
And ye will come in time to know the truth thereof
The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah the Mighty the Wise
Lo We have revealed the Scripture unto thee Muhammad with truth so worship Allah making religion pure for Him only
Surely pure religion is for Allah only
And those who choose protecting friends beside Him say We worship them only that they may bring us near unto Allah
Lo Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ
Lo Allah guideth not him who is a liar an ingrate
If Allah had willed to choose a son He could have chosen what He would of that which He hath created
Be He Glorified
He is Allah the One the Absolute
He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth
He maketh night to succeed day and He maketh day to succeed night and He constraineth the sun and the moon to give service each running on for an appointed term
Is not He the Mighty the Forgiver
He created you from one being then from that being He made its mate and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds
He created you in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation in a threefold gloom
Such is Allah your Lord
His is the Sovereignty
There is no Allah save Him
How then are ye turned away
If ye are thankless yet Allah is Independent of you though He is not pleased with thanklessness for His bondmen and if ye are thankful He is pleased therewith for you
No laden soul will bear another s load
Then unto your Lord is your return and He will tell you what ye used to do
Lo
He knoweth what is in the breasts of men
And when some hurt toucheth man he crieth unto his Lord turning unto Him repentant
Then when He granteth him a boon from Him he forgetteth that for which he cried unto Him before and setteth up rivals to Allah that he may beguile men from his way
Say O Muhammad unto such an one Take pleasure in thy disbelief a while
Lo thou art of the owners of the Fire
Is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night prostrate and standing bewaring of the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord to be accounted equal with a disbeliever
Say unto them O Muhammad Are those who know equal with those who know not
But only men of understanding will pay heed
Say O My bondmen who believe
Observe your duty to your Lord
For those who do good in this world there is good and Allah s earth is spacious
Verily the steadfast will be paid their wages without stint
Say O Muhammad Lo I am commanded to worship Allah making religion pure for Him only
And I am commanded to be the first of those who are muslims surrender unto Him
Say Lo if I should disobey my Lord I fear the doom of a tremendous Day
Say Allah I worship making my religion pure for Him only
Then worship what ye will beside Him
Say The losers will be those who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection
Ah that will be the manifest loss
They have an awning of fire above them and beneath them a dais of fire
With this doth Allah appal His bondmen
O My bondmen therefor fear Me
And those who put away false gods lest they should worship them and turn to Allah in repentance for them there are glad tidings
Therefor give good tidings O Muhammad to My bondmen
Who hear advice and follow the best thereof Such are those whom Allah guideth and such are men of understanding
Is he on whom the word of doom is fulfilled to be helped and canst thou O Muhammad rescue him who is in the Fire
But those who keep their duty to their Lord for them are lofty halls with lofty halls above them built for them beneath which rivers flow
It is a promise of Allah
Allah faileth not His promise
Hast thou not seen how Allah hath sent down water from the sky and hath caused it to penetrate the earth as watersprings and afterward thereby produceth crops of divers hues and afterward they wither and thou seest them turn yellow then He maketh them chaff Lo herein verily is a reminder for men of understanding
Is he whose bosom Allah hath expanded for AlIslam so that he followeth a light from his Lord as he who disbelieveth
Then woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of Allah
Such are in plain error
Allah hath now revealed the fairest of statements a Scripture consistent wherein promises of reward are paired with threats of punishment whereat doth creep the flesh of those who fear their Lord so that their flesh and their hearts soften to Allah s reminder
Such is Allah s guidance wherewith He guideth whom He will
And him whom Allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide
Is he then who will strike his face against the awful doom upon the Day of Resurrection as he who doeth right
And it will be said unto the wrongdoers Taste what ye used to earn
Those before them denied and so the doom came on them whence they knew not
Thus Allah made them taste humiliation in the life of the world and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be greater if they did but know
And verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur an all kinds of similitudes that haply they may reflect
A Lecture in Arabic containing no crookedness that haply they may ward off evil
Allah coineth a similitude A man in relation to whom are several partowners quarrelling and a man belonging wholly to one man
Are the two equal in similitude
Praise be to Allah But most of them know not
Lo thou wilt die and lo they will die
Then lo on the Day of Resurrection before your Lord ye will dispute
And who doth greater wrong than he who telleth a lie against Allah and denieth the truth when it reacheth him
Will not the home of disbelievers be in hell
And whoso bringeth the truth and believeth therein Such are the dutiful
They shall have what they will of their Lord s bounty
That is the reward of the good
That Allah will remit from them the worst of what they did and will pay them for reward the best they used to do
Will not Allah defend His slave
Yet they would frighten thee with those beside Him
He whom Allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide
And he whom Allah guideth for him there can be no misleader
Is not Allah Mighty Able to Requite the wrong
And verily if thou shouldst ask them Who created the heavens and the earth they will say Allah
Say Bethink you then of those ye worship beside Allah if Allah willed some hurt for me could they remove from me His hurt or if He willed some mercy for me could they restrain His mercy
Say Allah is my all
In Him do all the trusting put their trust
Say O my people
Act in your manner Lo
I too am acting Thus ye will come to know
Who it is unto whom cometh a doom that will abase him and on whom there falleth everlasting doom
Lo We have revealed unto thee Muhammad the Scripture for mankind with truth
Then whosoever goeth right it is for his soul and whosoever strayeth strayeth only to its hurt
And thou art not a warder over them
Allah receiveth men s souls at the time of their death and that soul which dieth not yet in its sleep
He keepeth that soul for which He hath ordained death and dismisseth the rest till an appointed term
Lo herein verily are portents for people who take thought
Or choose they intercessors other than Allah Say What
Even though they have power over nothing and have no intelligence
Say Unto Allah belongeth all intercession
His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
And afterward unto Him ye will be brought back
And when Allah alone is mentioned the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are repelled and when those whom they worship beside Him are mentioned behold they are glad
Say O Allah Creator of the heavens and the earth
Knower of the Invisible and the Visible Thou wilt judge between Thy slaves concerning that wherein they used to differ
And though those who do wrong possess all that is in the earth and therewith as much again they verily will seek to ransom themselves therewith on the Day of Resurrection from the awful doom and there will appear unto them from their Lord that wherewith they never reckoned
And the evils that they earned will appear unto them and that whereat they used to scoff will surround them
Now when hurt toucheth a man he crieth unto Us and afterward when We have granted him a boon from Us he saith Only by force of knowledge I obtained it
Nay but it is a test But most of them know not
Those before them said it yet all that they had earned availed them not
But the evils that they earned smote them and such of these as do wrong the evils that they earn will smite them they cannot escape
Know they not that Allah enlargeth providence for whom He will and straiteneth it for whom He will
Lo herein verily are portents for people who believe
Say O My slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt
Despair not of the mercy of Allah Who forgiveth all sins Lo
He is the Forgiving the Merciful
Turn unto your Lord repentant and surrender unto Him before there come unto you the doom when ye cannot be helped
And follow the better guidance of that which is revealed unto you from your Lord before the doom cometh on you suddenly when ye know not
Lest any soul should say Alas my grief that I was unmindful of Allah and I was indeed among the scoffers
Or should say If Allah had but guided me I should have been among the dutiful
Or should say when it seeth the doom Oh that I had but a second chance that I might be among the righteous
But now the answer will be Nay for My revelations came unto thee but thou didst deny them and wast scornful and wast among the disbelievers
And on the Day of Resurrection thou Muhammad seest those who lied concerning Allah with their faces blackened
Is not the home of the scorners in hell
And Allah delivereth those who ward off evil because of their deserts
Evil toucheth them not nor do they grieve
Allah is Creator of all things and He is Guardian over all things
His are the keys of the heavens and the earth and they who disbelieve the revelations of Allah such are they who are the losers
Say O Muhammad to the disbelievers Do ye bid me serve other than Allah O ye fools
And verily it hath been revealed unto thee as unto those before thee saying If thou ascribe a partner to Allah thy work will fail and thou indeed wilt be among the losers
Nay but Allah must thou serve and be among the thankful
And they esteem not Allah as He hath the right to be esteemed when the whole earth is His handful on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens are rolled in His right hand
Glorified is He and High Exalted from all that they ascribe as partner unto Him
And the trumpet is blown and all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth swoon away save him whom Allah willeth
Then it is blown a second time and behold them standing waiting
And the earth shineth with the light of her Lord and the Book is set up and the prophets and the witnesses are brought and it is judged between them with truth and they are not wronged
And each soul is paid in full for what it did
And He is Best Aware of what they do
And those who disbelieve are driven unto hell in troops till when they reach it and the gates thereof are opened and the warders thereof say unto them Came there not unto you messengers of your own reciting unto you the revelations of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this your Day they say Yea verily
But the word of doom of disbelievers is fulfilled
It is said unto them Enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein
Thus hapless is the journey s end of the scorners
And those who keep their duty to their Lord are driven unto the Garden in troops till when they reach it and the gates thereof are opened and the warders thereof say unto them Peace be unto you
Ye are good so enter ye the Garden of delight to dwell therein
They say Praise be to Allah Who hath fulfilled His promise unto us and hath made us inherit the land sojourning in the Garden where we will
So bounteous is the wage of workers
And thou O Muhammad seest the angels thronging round the Throne hymning the praises of their Lord
And they are judged aright And it is said Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds
Ha
Mim
The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah the Mighty the Knower
The Forgiver of sin the Accepter of repentance the Stern in punishment the Bountiful
There is no Allah save Him
Unto Him is the journeying
None argue concerning the revelations of Allah save those who disbelieve so let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive thee O Muhammad
The folk of Noah and the factions after them denied their messengers before these and every nation purposed to seize their messenger and argued falsely thinking thereby to refute the Truth Then I seized them and how awful was My punishment
Thus was the word of thy Lord concerning those who disbelieve fulfilled That they are owners of the Fire
Those who bear the Throne and all who are round about it hymn the praises of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who believe saying Our Lord
Thou comprehendest all things in mercy and knowledge therefor forgive those who repent and follow Thy way Ward off from them the punishment of hell
Our Lord
And make them enter the Gardens of Eden which thou hast promised them with such of their fathers and their wives and their descendants as do right Lo
Thou only Thou art the Mighty the Wise
And ward off from them illdeeds and he from whom Thou wardest off illdeeds that day him verily hast Thou taken into mercy
That is the supreme triumph
Lo on that day those who disbelieve are informed by proclamation Verily Allah s abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one of another when ye were called unto the faith but did refuse
They say Our Lord
Twice hast Thou made us die and twice hast Thou made us live
Now we confess our sins
Is there any way to go out
It is said unto them This is your plight because when Allah only was invoked ye disbelieved but when some partner was ascribed to Him ye were believing
But the command belongeth only to Allah the Sublime the Majestic
He it is Who showeth you His portents and sendeth down for you provision from the sky
None payeth heed save him who turneth unto Him repentant
Therefor O believers pray unto Allah making religion pure for Him only however much the disbelievers be averse
The Exalter of Ranks the Lord of the Throne
He causeth the Spirit of His command upon whom He will of His slaves that He may warn of the Day of Meeting
The day when they come forth nothing of them being hidden from Allah
Whose is the Sovereignty this day
It is Allah s the One the Almighty
This day is each soul requited that which it hath earned no wrong is done this day Lo
Allah is swift at reckoning
Warn them O Muhammad of the Day of the approaching doom when the hearts will be choking the throats when there will be no friend for the wrongdoers nor any intercessor who will be heard
He knoweth the traitor of the eyes and that which the bosoms hide
Allah judgeth with truth while those to whom they cry instead of Him judge not at all Lo
Allah He is the Hearer the Seer
Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who disbelieved before them
They were mightier than these in power and in the traces which they left behind them in the earth
Yet Allah seized them for their sins and they had no protector from Allah
That was because their messengers kept bringing them clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty but they disbelieved so Allah seized them Lo
He is Strong severe in punishment
And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant
Unto Pharaoh and Haman and Korah but they said A lying sorcerer
And when he brought them the Truth from Our presence they said Slay the sons of those who believe with him and spare their women
But the plot of disbelievers is in naught but error
And Pharaoh said Suffer me to kill Moses and let him cry unto his Lord Lo
I fear that he will alter your religion or that he will cause confusion in the land
Moses said Lo I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning
And a believing man of Pharaoh s family who hid his faith said Would ye kill a man because he saith My Lord is Allah and hath brought you clear proofs from your Lord
If he is lying then his lie is upon him and if he is truthful then some of that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you Lo
Allah guideth not one who is a prodigal a liar
O my people
Yours is the kingdom today ye being uppermost in the land
But who would save us from the wrath of Allah should it reach us
Pharaoh said I do but show you what I think and I do but guide you to wise policy
And he who believed said O my people
Lo I fear for you a fate like that of the factions of old
A plight like that of Noah s folk and A ad and Thamud and those after them and Allah willeth no injustice for His slaves
And O my people
Lo I fear for you a Day of Summoning
A day when ye will turn to flee having no preserver from Allah and he whom Allah sendeth astray for him there is no guide
And verily Joseph brought you of old clear proofs yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he brought you till when he died ye said Allah will not send any messenger after him
Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal a doubter
Those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah without any warrant that hath come unto them it is greatly hateful in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who believe
Thus doth Allah print on every arrogant disdainful heart
And Pharaoh said O Haman
Build for me a tower that haply I may reach the roads
The roads of the heavens and may look upon the god of Moses though verily I think him a liar
Thus was the evil that he did made fairseeming unto Pharaoh and he was debarred from the right way
The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin
And he who believed said O my people
Follow me I will show you the way of right conduct
O my people
Lo this life of the world is but a passing comfort and lo the Hereafter that is the enduring home
Whoso doeth an illdeed he will be repaid the like thereof while whoso doeth right whether male or female and is a believer all such will enter the Garden where they will be nourished without stint
And O my people
What aileth me that I call you unto deliverance when ye call me unto the Fire
Ye call me to disbelieve in Allah and ascribe unto Him as partners that whereof I have no knowledge while I call you unto the Mighty the Forgiver
Assuredly that whereunto ye call me hath no claim in the world or in the Hereafter and our return will be unto Allah and the prodigals will be owners of the Fire
And ye will remember what I say unto you
I confide my cause unto Allah Lo
Allah is Seer of His slaves
So Allah warded off from him the evils which they plotted while a dreadful doom encompassed Pharaoh s folk
The Fire they are exposed to it morning and evening and on the day when the Hour upriseth it is said Cause Pharaoh s folk to enter the most awful doom
And when they wrangle in the Fire the weak say unto those who were proud Lo we were a following unto you will ye therefor rid us of a portion of the Fire
Those who were proud say Lo we are all together herein
Lo Allah hath judged between His slaves
And those in the Fire say unto the guards of hell Entreat your Lord that He relieve us of a day of the torment
They say Came not your messengers unto you with clear proofs
They say Yea verily
They say Then do ye pray although the prayer of disbelievers is in vain
Lo We verily do help Our messengers and those who believe in the life of the world and on the day when the witnesses arise
The day when their excuse availeth not the evildoers and theirs is the curse and theirs the ill abode
And We verily gave Moses the guidance and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit the Scripture
A guide and a reminder for men of understanding
Then have patience O Muhammad
Lo the promise of Allah is true
And ask forgiveness of thy sin and hymn the praise of thy Lord at fall of night and in the early hours
Lo those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah without a warrant having come unto them there is naught else in their breasts save pride which they will never attain
So take thou refuge in Allah
Lo
He only He is the Hearer the Seer
Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind but most of mankind know not
And the blind man and the seer are not equal neither are those who believe and do good works equal with the evildoer
Little do ye reflect
Lo the Hour is surely coming there is no doubt thereof yet most of mankind believe not
And your Lord hath said Pray unto Me and I will hear your prayer
Lo those who scorn My service they will enter hell disgraced
Allah it is Who hath appointed for you night that ye may rest therein and day for seeing Lo
Allah is a Lord of bounty for mankind yet most of mankind give not thanks
Such is Allah your Lord the Creator of all things There is no Allah save Him
How then are ye perverted
Thus are they perverted who deny the revelations of Allah
Allah it is Who appointed for you the earth for a dwellingplace and the sky for a canopy and fashioned you and perfected your shapes and hath provided you with good things
Such is Allah your Lord
Then blessed be Allah the Lord of the Worlds
He is the Living One There is no Allah save Him
So pray unto Him making religion pure for Him only
Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds
Say O Muhammad I am forbidden to worship those unto whom ye cry beside Allah since there have come unto me clear proofs from my Lord and I am commanded to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds
He it is Who created you from dust then from a drop of seed then from a clot then bringeth you forth as a child then ordaineth that ye attain full strength and afterward that ye become old men though some among you die before and that ye reach an appointed term that haply ye may understand
He it is Who quickeneth and giveth death
When He ordaineth a thing He saith unto it only Be and it is
Hast thou not seen those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah how they are turned away
Those who deny the Scripture and that wherewith We send Our messengers
But they will come to know
When carcans are about their necks and chains They are dragged
Through boiling waters then they are thrust into the Fire
Then it is said unto them Where are all that ye used to make partners in the Sovereignty
Beside Allah
They say They have failed us but we used not to pray to anything before
Thus doth Allah send astray the disbelievers in His guidance
And it is said unto them This is because ye exulted in the earth without right and because ye were petulant
Enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein
Evil is the habitation of the scornful
Then have patience O Muhammad
Lo the promise of Allah is true
And whether we let thee see a part of that which We promise them or whether We cause thee to die still unto Us they will be brought back
Verily We sent messengers before thee among them those of whom We have told thee and some of whom We have not told thee and it was not given to any messenger that he should bring a portent save by Allah s leave but when Allah s commandment cometh the cause is judged aright and the followers of vanity will then be lost
Allah it is Who hath appointed for you cattle that ye may ride on some of them and eat of some
Many benefits ye have from them and that ye may satisfy by their means a need that is in your breasts and may be borne upon them as upon the ship
And He showeth you His tokens
Which then of the tokens of Allah do ye deny
Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those before them
They were more numerous than these and mightier in power and in the traces which they left behind them in the earth
But all that they used to earn availed them not
And when their messengers brought them clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty they exulted in the knowledge they themselves possessed And that which they were wont to mock befell them
Then when they saw Our doom they said We believe in Allah only and reject all that we used to associate with Him
But their faith could not avail them when they saw Our doom
This is Allah s law which hath ever taken course for His bondmen
And then the disbelievers will be ruined
Ha
Mim
A revelation from the Beneficent the Merciful
A Scripture whereof the verses are expounded a Lecture in Arabic for people who have knowledge
Good tidings and a warning
But most of them turn away so that they hear not
And they say Our hearts are protected from that unto which thou O Muhammad callest us and in our ears there is a deafness and between us and thee there is a veil
Act then Lo we also shall be acting
Say unto them O Muhammad I am only a mortal like you
It is inspired in me that your Allah is One Allah therefor take the straight path unto Him and seek forgiveness of Him
And woe unto the idolaters
Who give not the poordue and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter
Lo as for those who believe and do good works for them is a reward enduring
Say O Muhammad unto the idolaters Disbelieve ye verily in Him Who created the earth in two Days and ascribe ye unto Him rivals
He and none else is the Lord of the Worlds
He placed therein firm hills rising above it and blessed it and measured therein its sustenance in four Days alike for all who ask
Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke and said unto it and unto the earth Come both of you willingly or loth
They said We come obedient
Then He ordained them seven heavens in two Days and inspired in each heaven its mandate and We decked the nether heaven with lamps and rendered it inviolable
That is the measuring of the Mighty the Knower
But if they turn away then say I warn you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt which fell of old upon the tribes of A ad and Thamud
When their messengers came unto them from before them and behind them saying Worship none but Allah they said If our Lord had willed He surely would have sent down angels unto us so lo we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent
As for A ad they were arrogant in the land without right and they said Who is mightier than us in power
Could they not see that Allah Who created them He was mightier than them in power
And they denied Our revelations
Therefor We let loose on them a raging wind in evil days that We might make them taste the torment of disgrace in the life of the world
And verily the doom of the Hereafter will be more shameful and they will not be helped
And as for Thamud We gave them guidance but they preferred blindness to the guidance so the bolt of the doom of humiliation overtook them because of what they used to earn
And We delivered those who believed and used to keep their duty to Allah
And make mention of the day when the enemies of Allah are gathered unto the Fire they are driven on
Till when they reach it their ears and their eyes and their skins testify against them as to what they used to do
And they say unto their skins Why testify ye against us
They say Allah hath given us speech Who giveth speech to all things and Who created you at the first and unto Whom ye are returned
Ye did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify against you but ye deemed that Allah knew not much of what ye did
That your thought which ye did think about your Lord hath ruined you and ye find yourselves this day among the lost
And though they are resigned yet the Fire is still their home and if they ask for favour yet they are not of those unto whom favour can be shown
And We assigned them comrades in the world who made their present and their past fairseeming unto them
And the Word concerning nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before them hath effect for them
Lo they were ever losers
Those who disbelieve say Heed not this Qur an and drown the hearing of it haply ye may conquer
But verily We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste an awful doom and verily We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do
That is the reward of Allah s enemies the Fire
Therein is their immortal home payment forasmuch as they denied Our revelations
And those who disbelieve will say Our Lord
Show us those who beguiled us of the jinn and humankind We will place them underneath our feet that they may be among the nethermost
Lo those who say Our Lord is Allah and afterward are upright the angels descend upon them saying Fear not nor grieve but hear good tidings of the paradise which ye are promised
We are your protecting friends in the life of the world and in the Hereafter
There ye will have all that your souls desire and there ye will have all for which ye pray
A gift of welcome from One Forgiving Merciful
And who is better in speech than him who prayeth unto his Lord and doeth right and saith Lo I am of those who are muslims surrender unto Him
The good deed and the evil deed are not alike
Repel the evil deed with one which is better then lo he between whom and thee there was enmity will become as though he was a bosom friend
But none is granted it save those who are steadfast and none is granted it save the owner of great happiness
And if a whisper from the devil reach thee O Muhammad then seek refuge in Allah
Lo He is the Hearer the Knower
And of His portents are the night and the day and the sun and the moon
Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon but prostrate to Allah Who created them if it is in truth Him Whom ye worship
But if they are too proud still those who are with thy Lord glorify Him night and day and tire not
And of His portents is this that thou seest the earth lowly but when We send down water thereon it thrilleth and groweth Lo
He Who quickeneth it is verily the Quickener of the Dead
Lo He is Able to do all things
Lo those who distort Our revelations are not hid from Us
Is he who is hurled into the Fire better or he who cometh secure on the Day of Resurrection
Do what ye will
Lo He is Seer of what ye do
Lo those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it cometh unto them are guilty for lo it is an unassailable Scripture
Falsehood cannot come at it from before it or from behind it
It is a revelation from the Wise the Owner of Praise
Naught is said unto thee Muhammad save what was said unto the messengers before thee
Lo thy Lord is owner of forgiveness and owner also of dire punishment
And if We had appointed it a Lecture in a foreign tongue they would assuredly have said If only its verses were expounded so that we might understand What
A foreign tongue and an Arab Say unto them O Muhammad For those who believe it is a guidance and a healing and as for those who disbelieve there is a deafness in their ears and it is blindness for them
Such are called to from afar
And We verily gave Moses the Scripture but there hath been dispute concerning it and but for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord it would ere now have been judged between them but lo they are in hopeless doubt concerning it
Whoso doeth right it is for his soul and whoso doeth wrong it is against it
And thy Lord is not at all a tyrant to His slaves
Unto Him is referred all knowledge of the Hour
And no fruits burst forth from their sheaths and no female carrieth or bringeth forth but with His knowledge
And on the day when He calleth unto them Where are now My partners they will say We confess unto Thee not one of us is a witness for them
And those to whom they used to cry of old have failed them and they perceive they have no place of refuge
Man tireth not of praying for good and if ill toucheth him then he is disheartened desperate
And verily if We cause him to taste mercy after some hurt that hath touched him he will say This is my own and I deem not that the Hour will ever rise and if I am brought back to my Lord I surely shall be better off with Him But We verily shall tell those who disbelieve all that they did and We verily shall make them taste hard punishment
When We show favour unto man he withdraweth and turneth aside but when ill toucheth him then he aboundeth in prayer
Bethink you If it is from Allah and ye reject it Who is further astray than one who is at open feud with Allah
We shall show them Our portents on the horizons and within themselves until it will be manifest unto them that it is the Truth
Doth not thy Lord suffice since He is Witness over all things
How Are they still in doubt about the meeting with their Lord
Lo Is not He surrounding all things
Ha
Mim
A in
Sin
Qaf
Thus Allah the Mighty the Knower inspireth thee Muhammad as He inspired those before thee
Unto Him belongeth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and He is the Sublime the Tremendous
Almost might the heavens above be rent asunder while the angels hymn the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth Lo
Allah He is the Forgiver the Merciful
And as for those who choose protecting friends beside Him Allah is Warden over them and thou art in no wise a guardian over them
And thus We have inspired in thee a Lecture in Arabic that thou mayst warn the mothertown and those around it and mayst warn of a day of assembling whereof there is no doubt
A host will be in the Garden and a host of them in the Flame
Had Allah willed He could have made them one community but Allah bringeth whom He will into His mercy
And the wrongdoers have no friend nor helper
Or have they chosen protecting friends besides Him
But Allah He alone is the Protecting Friend
He quickeneth the dead and He is Able to do all things
And in whatsoever ye differ the verdict therein belongeth to Allah
Such is my Lord in Whom I put my trust and unto Whom I turn
The Creator of the heavens and the earth
He hath made for you pairs of yourselves and of the cattle also pairs whereby He multiplieth you
Naught is as His likeness and He is the Hearer the Seer
His are the keys of the heavens and the earth
He enlargeth providence for whom He will and straiteneth it for whom He will Lo
He is Knower of all things
He hath ordained for you that religion which He commended unto Noah and that which We inspire in thee Muhammad and that which We commended unto Abraham and Moses and Jesus saying Establish the religion and be not divided therein
Dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them
Allah chooseth for Himself whom He will and guideth unto Himself him who turneth toward Him
And they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them through rivalry among themselves and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term it surely had been judged between them
And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in hopeless doubt concerning it
Unto this then summon O Muhammad
And be thou upright as thou art commanded and follow not their lusts but say I believe in whatever scripture Allah hath sent down and I am commanded to be just among you
Allah is our Lord and your Lord
Unto us our works and unto you your works no argument between us and you
Allah will bring us together and unto Him is the journeying
And those who argue concerning Allah after He hath been acknowledged their argument hath no weight with their Lord and wrath is upon them and theirs will be an awful doom
Allah it is Who hath revealed the Scripture with truth and the Balance
How canst thou know It may be that the Hour is nigh
Those who believe not therein seek to hasten it while those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the Truth
Are not they who dispute in doubt concerning the Hour far astray
Allah is gracious unto His slaves
He provideth for whom He will
And He is the Strong the Mighty
Whoso desireth the harvest of the Hereafter We give him increase in its harvest
And whoso desireth the harvest of the world We give him thereof and he hath no portion in the Hereafter
Or have they partners of Allah who have made lawful for them in religion that which Allah allowed not
And but for a decisive word gone forth already it would have been judged between them
Lo for wrongdoers is a painful doom
Thou seest the wrongdoers fearful of that which they have earned and it will surely befall them while those who believe and do good works will be in flowering meadows of the Gardens having what they wish from their Lord
This is the great preferment
This it is which Allah announceth unto His bondmen who believe and do good works
Say O Muhammad unto mankind I ask of you no fee therefor save lovingkindness among kinsfolk
And whoso scoreth a good deed We add unto its good for him
Lo Allah is Forgiving Responsive
Or say they He hath invented a lie concerning Allah
If Allah willed He could have sealed thy heart against them
And Allah will wipe out the lie and will vindicate the truth by His words Lo
He is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts of men
And He it is Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen and pardoneth the evil deeds and knoweth what ye do
And accepteth those who do good works and giveth increase unto them of His bounty
And as for disbelievers theirs will be an awful doom
And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves they would surely rebel in the earth but He sendeth down by measure as He willeth Lo
He is Informed a Seer of His bondmen
And He it is Who sendeth down the saving rain after they have despaired and spreadeth out His mercy
He is the Protecting Friend the Praiseworthy
And of His portents is the creation of the heaven and the earth and of whatever beasts He hath dispersed therein
And He is Able to gather them when He will
Whatever of misfortune striketh you it is what your right hands have earned
And He forgiveth much
Ye cannot escape in the earth for beside Allah ye have no protecting friend nor any helper
And of His portents are the ships like banners on the sea
If He will He calmeth the wind so that they keep still upon its surface Lo herein verily are signs for every steadfast grateful heart
Or He causeth them to perish on account of that which they have earned And He forgiveth much
And that those who argue concerning Our revelations may know they have no refuge
Now whatever ye have been given is but a passing comfort for the life of the world and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord
And those who shun the worst of sins and indecencies and when they are wroth forgive
And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish worship and whose affairs are a matter of counsel and who spend of what We have bestowed on them
And those who when great wrong is done to them defend themselves
The guerdon of an illdeed is an ill the like thereof
But whosoever pardoneth and amendeth his wage is the affair of Allah
Lo He loveth not wrongdoers
And whoso defendeth himself after he hath suffered wrong for such there is no way of blame against them
The way of blame is only against those who oppress mankind and wrongfully rebel in the earth
For such there is a painful doom
And verily whoso is patient and forgiveth lo that verily is of the steadfast heart of things
He whom Allah sendeth astray for him there is no protecting friend after Him
And thou Muhammad wilt see the evildoers when they see the doom how they say Is there any way of return
And thou wilt see them exposed to the Fire made humble by disgrace and looking with veiled eyes
And those who believe will say Lo the eternal losers are they who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection
Lo are not the wrongdoers in perpetual torment
And they will have no protecting friends to help them instead of Allah
He whom Allah sendeth astray for him there is no road
Answer the call of your Lord before there cometh unto you from Allah a Day which there is no averting
Ye have no refuge on that Day nor have a ye any power of refusal
But if they are averse We have not sent thee as a warder over them
Thine is only to convey the message
And lo when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us he exulteth therefor
And if some evil striketh them because of that which their own hands have sent before then lo man is an ingrate
Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
He createth what He will He bestoweth female offspring upon whom He will and bestoweth male offspring upon whom He will
Or He mingleth them males and females and He maketh barren whom He will
Lo He is Knower Powerful
And it was not vouchsafed to any mortal that Allah should speak to him unless it be by revelation or from behind a veil or that He sendeth a messenger to reveal what He will by His leave
Lo He is Exalted Wise
And thus have We inspired in thee Muhammad a Spirit of Our command
Thou knewest not what the Scripture was nor what the Faith
But We have made it a light whereby We guide whom We will of Our bondmen
And lo thou verily dost guide unto a right path
The path of Allah unto Whom belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth
Do not all things reach Allah at last
Ha
Mim
By the Scripture which maketh plain
Lo We have appointed it a Lecture in Arabic that haply ye may understand
And Lo in the Source of Decrees which We possess it is indeed sublime decisive
Shall We utterly ignore you because ye are a wanton folk
How many a prophet did We send among the men of old
And never came there unto them a prophet but they used to mock him
Then We destroyed men mightier than these in prowess and the example of the men of old hath gone before them
And if thou Muhammad ask them Who created the heavens and the earth they will surely answer The Mighty the Knower created them
Who made the earth a restingplace for you and placed roads for you therein that haply ye may find your way
And Who sendeth down water from the sky in due measure and We revive a dead land therewith
Even so will ye be brought forth
He Who created all the pairs and appointed for you ships and cattle whereupon ye ride
That ye may mount upon their backs and may remember your Lord s favour when ye mount thereon and may say Glorified be He Who hath subdued these unto us and we were not capable of subduing them
And lo unto our Lord we surely are returning
And they allot to Him a portion of His bondmen
Lo man is verily a mere ingrate
Or chooseth He daughters of all that He hath created and honoureth He you with sons
And if one of them hath tidings of that which he likeneth to the Beneficent One his countenance becometh black and he is full of inward rage
Liken they then to Allah that which is bred up in outward show and in dispute cannot make itself plain
And they make the angels who are the slaves of the Beneficent females
Did they witness their creation
Their testimony will be recorded and they will be questioned
And they say If the Beneficent One had so willed we should not have worshipped them
They have no knowledge whatsoever of that
They do but guess
Or have We given them any scripture before this Qur an so that they are holding fast thereto
Nay for they say only Lo we found our fathers following a religion and we are guided by their footprints
And even so We sent not a warner before thee Muhammad into any township but its luxurious ones said Lo we found our fathers following a religion and we are following their footprints
And the warner said What Even though I bring you better guidance than that ye found your fathers following
They answered Lo in what ye bring we are disbelievers
So We requited them
Then see the nature of the consequence for the rejecters
And when Abraham said unto his father and his folk Lo I am innocent of what ye worship
Save Him Who did create me for He will surely guide me
And he made it a word enduring among his seed that haply they might return
Nay but I let these and their fathers enjoy life only till there should come unto them the Truth and a messenger making plain
And now that the Truth hath come unto them they say This is mere magic and lo we are disbelievers therein
And they say If only this Qur an had been revealed to some great man of the two towns
Is it they who apportion thy Lord s mercy
We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of the world and raised some of them above others in rank that some of them may take labour from others and the mercy of thy Lord is better than the wealth that they amass
And were it not that mankind would have become one community We might well have appointed for those who disbelieve in the Beneficent roofs of silver for their houses and stairs of silver whereby to mount
And for their houses doors of silver and couches of silver whereon to recline
And ornaments of gold
Yet all that would have been but a provision of the life of the world
And the Hereafter with your Lord would have been for those who keep from evil
And he whose sight is dim to the remembrance of the Beneficent We assign unto him a devil who becometh his comrade
And lo they surely turn them from the way of Allah and yet they deem that they are rightly guided
Till when he cometh unto Us he saith unto his comrade Ah would that between me and thee there were the distance of the two horizons an evil comrade
And it profiteth you not this day because ye did wrong that ye will be sharers in the doom
Canst thou Muhammad make the deaf to hear or canst thou guide the blind or him who is in error manifest
And if We take thee away We surely shall take vengeance on them
Or if We show thee that wherewith We threaten them for lo
We have complete command of them
So hold thou fast to that which is inspired in thee
Lo thou art on a right path
And lo it is in truth a Reminder for thee and for thy folk and ye will be questioned
And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before thee Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped beside the Beneficent
And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations unto Pharaoh and his chiefs and he said I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds
But when he brought them Our tokens behold they laughed at them
And every token that We showed them was greater than its sister token and We grasped them with the torment that haply they might turn again
And they said O wizard
Entreat thy Lord for us by the pact that He hath made with thee Lo we verily will walk aright
But when We eased them of the torment behold they broke their word
And Pharaoh caused a proclamation to be made among his people saying O my people
Is not mine the sovereignty of Egypt and these rivers flowing under me
Can ye not then discern
I am surely better than this fellow who is despicable and can hardly make his meaning plain
Why then have armlets of gold not been set upon him or angels sent along with him
Thus he persuaded his people to make light of Moses and they obeyed him
Lo they were a wanton folk
So when they angered Us We punished them and drowned them every one
And We made them a thing past and an example for those after them
And when the son of Mary is quoted as an example behold the folk laugh out
And say Are our gods better or is he
They raise not the objection save for argument
Nay but they are a contentious folk
He is nothing but a slave on whom We bestowed favour and We made him a pattern for the Children of Israel
And had We willed We could have set among you angels to be viceroys in the earth
And lo verily there is knowledge of the Hour
So doubt ye not concerning it but follow Me
This is the right path
And let not Satan turn you aside
Lo he is an open enemy for you
When Jesus came with clear proofs of Allah s Sovereignty he said I have come unto you with wisdom and to make plain some of that concerning which ye differ
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
Lo Allah He is my Lord and your Lord
So worship Him
This is a right path
But the factions among them differed
Then woe unto those who do wrong from the doom of a painful day
Await they aught save the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly when they know not
Friends on that day will be foes one to another save those who kept their duty to Allah
O My slaves
For you there is no fear this day nor is it ye who grieve
Ye who believed Our revelations and were selfsurrendered
Enter the Garden ye and your wives to be made glad
Therein are brought round for them trays of gold and goblets and therein is all that souls desire and eyes find sweet
And ye are immortal therein
This is the Garden which ye are made to inherit because of what ye used to do
Therein for you is fruit in plenty whence to eat
Lo the guilty are immortal in hell s torment
It is not relaxed for them and they despair therein
We wronged them not but they it was who did the wrong
And they cry O master
Let thy Lord make an end of us
He saith Lo here ye must remain
We verily brought the Truth unto you but ye were most of you averse to the Truth
Or do they determine any thing against the Prophet
Lo We also are determining
Or deem they that We cannot hear their secret thoughts and private confidences
Nay but Our envoys present with them do record
Say O Muhammad If the Beneficent One hath a son then I shall be first among the worshippers But there is no son
Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and the earth the Lord of the Throne from that which they ascribe unto Him
So let them flounder in their talk and play until they meet the Day which they are promised
And He it is Who in the heaven is Allah and in the earth Allah
He is the Wise the Knower
And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and with Whom is knowledge of the Hour and unto Whom ye will be returned
And those unto whom they cry instead of Him possess no power of intercession saving him who beareth witness unto the Truth knowingly
And if thou ask them who created them they will surely say Allah
How then are they turned away
And he saith O my Lord
Lo these are a folk who believe not
Then bear with them O Muhammad and say Peace
But they will come to know
Ha
Mim
By the Scripture that maketh plain
Lo We revealed it on a blessed night Lo
We are ever warning
Whereon every wise command is made clear
As a command from Our presence Lo
We are ever sending
A mercy from thy Lord Lo
He even He is the Hearer the Knower
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them if ye would be sure
There is no Allah save Him
He quickeneth and giveth death your Lord and Lord of your forefathers
Nay but they play in doubt
But watch thou O Muhammad for the day when the sky will produce visible smoke
That will envelop the people
This will be a painful torment
Then they will say Our Lord relieve us of the torment Lo we are believers
How can there be remembrance for them when a messenger making plain the Truth had already come unto them
And they had turned away from him and said One taught by others a madman
We withdraw the torment a little Lo ye return to disbelief
On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure then in truth We shall punish
And verily We tried before them Pharaoh s folk when there came unto them a noble messenger
Saying Give up to me the slaves of Allah
Lo I am a faithful messenger unto you
And saying Be not proud against Allah
Lo I bring you a clear warrant
And lo I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to death
And if ye put no faith in me then let me go
And he cried unto his Lord saying These are guilty folk
Then his Lord commanded Take away My slaves by night
Lo ye will be followed
And leave the sea behind at rest for lo they are a drowned host
How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind
And the cornlands and the goodly sites
And pleasant things wherein they took delight
Even so it was and We made it an inheritance for other folk
And the heaven and the earth wept not for them nor were they reprieved
And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom
We delivered them from Pharaoh
Lo he was a tyrant of the wanton ones
And We chose them purposely above all creatures
And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial
Lo these forsooth are saying
There is naught but our first death and we shall not be raised again
Bring back our fathers if ye speak the truth
Are they better or the folk of Tubb a and those before them
We destroyed them for surely they were guilty
And We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in play
We created them not save with truth but most of them know not
Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them
A day when friend can in naught avail friend nor can they be helped
Save him on whom Allah hath mercy
Lo He is the Mighty the Merciful
Lo the tree of Zaqqum
The food of the sinner
Like molten brass it seetheth in their bellies
As the seething of boiling water
And it will be said Take him and drag him to the midst of hell
Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water
Saying Taste
Lo thou wast forsooth the mighty the noble
Lo this is that whereof ye used to doubt
Lo those who kept their duty will be in a place secured
Amid gardens and watersprings
Attired in silk and silk embroidery facing one another
Even so it will be
And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide lovely eyes
They call therein for every fruit in safety
They taste not death therein save the first death
And He hath saved them from the doom of hell
A bounty from thy Lord
That is the supreme triumph
And We have made this Scripture easy in thy language only that they may heed
Wait then O Muhammad
Lo they too are waiting
Ha
Mim
The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah the Mighty the Wise
Lo in the heavens and the earth are portents for believers
And in your creation and all the beasts that He scattereth in the earth are portents for a folk whose faith is sure
And the difference of night and day and the provision that Allah sendeth down from the sky and thereby quickeneth the earth after her death and the ordering of the winds are portents for a people who have sense
These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee Muhammad with truth
Then in what fact after Allah and His portents will they believe
Woe unto each sinful liar
Who heareth the revelations of Allah recited unto him and then continueth in pride as though he heard them not
Give him tidings of a painful doom
And when he knoweth aught of Our revelations he maketh it a jest
For such there is a shameful doom
Beyond them there is hell and that which they have earned will naught avail them nor those whom they have chosen for protecting friends beside Allah
Theirs will be an awful doom
This is guidance
And those who disbelieve the revelations of their Lord for them there is a painful doom of wrath
Allah it is Who hath made the sea of service unto you that the ships may run thereon by His command and that ye may seek of His bounty and that haply ye may be thankful
And hath made of service unto you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth it is all from Him
Lo herein verily are portents for a people who reflect
Tell those who believe to forgive those who hope not for the days of Allah in order that He may requite folk what they used to earn
Whoso doeth right it is for his soul and whoso doeth wrong it is against it
And afterward unto your Lord ye will be brought back
And verily we gave the Children of Israel the Scripture and the Command and the Prophethood and provided them with good things and favoured them above all peoples
And gave them plain commandments
And they differed not until after the knowledge came unto them through rivalry among themselves
Lo thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ
And now have We set thee O Muhammad on a clear road of Our commandment so follow it and follow not the whims of those who know not
Lo they can avail thee naught against Allah
And lo as for the wrongdoers some of them are friends of others and Allah is the Friend of those who ward off evil
This is clear indication for mankind and a guidance and a mercy for a folk whose faith is sure
Or do those who commit illdeeds suppose that We shall make them as those who believe and do good works the same in life and death
Bad is their judgment
And Allah hath created the heavens and the earth with truth and that every soul may be repaid what it hath earned
And they will not be wronged
Hast thou seen him who maketh his desire his god and Allah sendeth him astray purposely and sealeth up his hearing and his heart and setteth on his sight a covering
Then who will lead him after Allah hath condemned him
Will ye not then heed
And they say There is naught but our life of the world we die and we live and naught destroyeth us save time when they have no knowledge whatsoever of all that they do but guess
And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them their only argument is that they say Bring back our fathers then if ye are truthful
Say unto them O Muhammad Allah giveth life to you then causeth you to die then gathereth you unto the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt
But most of mankind know not
And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and on the day when the Hour riseth on that day those who follow falsehood will be lost
And thou wilt see each nation crouching each nation summoned to its record
And it will be said unto them This day ye are requited what ye used to do
This Our Book pronounceth against you with truth Lo
We have caused all that ye did to be recorded
Then as for those who believed and did good works their Lord will bring them in unto His mercy
That is the evident triumph
And as for those who disbelieved it will be said unto them Were not Our revelations recited unto you
But ye were scornful and became a guilty folk
And when it was said Lo Allah s promise is the truth and there is no doubt of the Hour s coming ye said We know not what the Hour is
We deem it naught but a conjecture and we are by no means convinced
And the evils of what they did will appear unto them and that which they used to deride will befall them
And it will be said This day We forget you even as ye forgot the meeting of this your day and your habitation is the Fire and there is none to help you
This forasmuch as ye made the revelations of Allah a jest and the life of the world beguiled you
Therefor this day they come not forth from thence nor can they make amends
Then praise be to Allah Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth the Lord of the Worlds
And unto Him alone belongeth Majesty in the heavens and the earth and He is the Mighty the Wise
Ha
Mim
The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah the Mighty the Wise
We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save with truth and for a term appointed
But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned
Say unto them O Muhammad Have ye thought on all that ye invoke beside Allah
Show me what they have created of the earth Or have they any portion in the heavens
Bring me a scripture before this Scripture or some vestige of knowledge in support of what ye say if ye are truthful
And who is further astray than those who instead of Allah pray unto such as hear not their prayer until the Day of Resurrection and are unconscious of their prayer
And when mankind are gathered to the Judgment will become enemies for them and will become deniers of having been worshipped
And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them those who disbelieve say of the Truth when it reacheth them This is mere magic
Or say they He hath invented it
Say O Muhammad If I have invented it still ye have no power to support me against Allah
He is Best Aware of what ye say among yourselves concerning it
He sufficeth for a witness between me and you
And He is the Forgiving the Merciful
Say I am no new thing among the messengers of Allah nor know I what will be done with me or with you
I do but follow that which is inspired in me and I am but a plain warner
Bethink you If it is from Allah and ye disbelieve therein and a witness of the Children of Israel hath already testified to the like thereof and hath believed and ye are too proud what plight is yours
Lo Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk
And those who disbelieve say of those who believe If it had been any good they would not have been before us in attaining it
And since they will not be guided by it they say This is an ancient lie
When before it there was the Scripture of Moses an example and a mercy and this is a confirming Scripture in the Arabic language that it may warn those who do wrong and bring good tidings for the righteous
Lo those who say Our Lord is Allah and thereafter walk aright there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve
Such are rightful owners of the Garden immortal therein as a reward for what they used to do
And We have commended unto man kindness toward parents
His mother beareth him with reluctance and bringeth him forth with reluctance and the bearing of him and the weaning of him is thirty months till when he attaineth full strength and reacheth forty years he saith My Lord
Arouse me that I may give thanks for the favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents and that I may do right acceptable unto Thee And be gracious unto me in the matter of my seed
Lo I have turned unto Thee repentant and lo
I am of those who surrender unto Thee
Those are they from whom We accept the best of what they do and overlook their evil deeds They are among the owners of the Garden
This is the true promise which they were promised in the world
And whoso saith unto his parents Fie upon you both
Do ye threaten me that I shall be brought forth again when generations before me have passed away
And they twain cry unto Allah for help and say Woe unto thee
Believe Lo the promise of Allah is true
But he saith This is naught save fables of the men of old
Such are those on whom the Word concerning nations of the jinn and mankind which have passed away before them hath effect
Lo they are the losers
And for all there will be ranks from what they do that He may pay them for their deeds and they will not be wronged
And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire it will be said Ye squandered your good things in the life of the world and sought comfort therein
Now this day ye are rewarded with the doom of ignominy because ye were disdainful in the land without a right and because ye used to transgress
And make mention O Muhammad of the brother of A ad when he warned his folk among the windcurved sandhills and verily warners came and went before and after him saying Serve none but Allah Lo
I fear for you the doom of a tremendous Day
They said Hast come to turn us away from our gods
Then bring upon us that wherewith thou threatenest us if thou art of the truthful
He said The knowledge is with Allah only
I convey unto you that wherewith I have been sent but I see you are a folk that know not
Then when they beheld it as a dense cloud coming toward their valleys they said Here is a cloud bringing us rain
Nay but it is that which ye did seek to hasten a wind wherein is painful torment
Destroying all things by commandment of its Lord
And morning found them so that naught could be seen save their dwellings
Thus do We reward the guilty folk
And verily We had empowered them with that wherewith We have not empowered you and had assigned them ears and eyes and hearts but their ears and eyes and hearts availed them naught since they denied the revelations of Allah and what they used to mock befell them
And verily We have destroyed townships round about you and displayed for them Our revelation that haply they might return
Then why did those whom they had chosen for gods as a way of approach unto Allah not help them
Nay but they did fail them utterly
And all that was their lie and what they used to invent
And when We inclined toward thee Muhammad certain of the jinn who wished to hear the Qur an and when they were in its presence said Give ear and when it was finished turned back to their people warning
They said O our people
Lo we have heard a scripture which hath been revealed after Moses confirming that which was before it guiding unto the truth and a right road
O our people respond to Allah s summoner and believe in Him He will forgive you some of your sins and guard you from a painful doom
And whoso respondeth not to Allah s summoner he can nowise escape in the earth and he hath no protecting friends instead of Him
Such are in error manifest
Have they not seen that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and was not wearied by their creation is Able to give life to the dead
Aye He verily is Able to do all things
And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire they will be asked Is not this real
They will say Yea by our Lord
He will say Then taste the doom for that ye disbelieved
Then have patience O Muhammad even as the stout of heart among the messengers of old had patience and seek not to hasten on the doom for them
On the day when they see that which they are promised it will seem to them as though they had tarried but an hour of daylight
A clear message
Shall any be destroyed save evilliving folk
Those who disbelieve and turn men from the way of Allah He rendereth their actions vain
And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is revealed unto Muhammad and it is the truth from their Lord He riddeth them of their illdeeds and improveth their state
That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord
Thus Allah coineth their similitudes for mankind
Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve then it is smiting of the necks until when ye have routed them then making fast of bonds and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens
That is the ordinance
And if Allah willed He could have punished them without you but thus it is ordained that He may try some of you by means of others
And those who are slain in the way of Allah He rendereth not their actions vain
He will guide them and improve their state
And bring them in unto the Garden which He hath made known to them
O ye who believe
If ye help Allah He will help you and will make your foothold firm
And those who disbelieve perdition is for them and He will make their actions vain
That is because they are averse to that which Allah hath revealed therefor maketh He their actions fruitless
Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them
Allah wiped them out
And for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof
That is because Allah is patron of those who believe and because the disbelievers have no patron
Lo Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow while those who disbelieve take their comfort in this life and eat even as the cattle eat and the Fire is their habitation
And how many a township stronger than thy township O Muhammad which hath cast thee out have We destroyed and they had no helper
Is he who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord like those for whom the evil that they do is beautified while they follow their own lusts
A similitude of the Garden which those who keep their duty to Allah are promised Therein are rivers of water unpolluted and rivers of milk whereof the flavour changeth not and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers and rivers of clearrun honey therein for them is every kind of fruit with pardon from their Lord
Are those who enjoy all this like those who are immortal in the Fire and are given boiling water to drink so that it teareth their bowels
Among them are some who give ear unto thee Muhammad till when they go forth from thy presence they say unto those who have been given knowledge What was that he said just now
Those are they whose hearts Allah hath sealed and they follow their own lusts
While as for those who walk aright He addeth to their guidance and giveth them their protection against evil
Await they aught save the Hour that it should come upon them unawares
And the beginnings thereof have already come
But how when it hath come upon them can they take their warning
So know O Muhammad that there is no Allah save Allah and ask forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men and believing women
Allah knoweth both your place of turmoil and your place of rest
And those who believe say If only a surah were revealed
But when a decisive surah is revealed and war is mentioned therein thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with the look of men fainting unto death
Therefor woe unto them
Obedience and a civil word
Then when the matter is determined if they are loyal to Allah it will be well for them
Would ye then if ye were given the command work corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship
Such are they whom Allah curseth so that He deafeneth them and maketh blind their eyes
Will they then not meditate on the Qur an or are there locks on the hearts
Lo those who turn back after the guidance hath been manifested unto them Satan hath seduced them and He giveth them the rein
That is because they say unto those who hate what Allah hath revealed We will obey you in some matters and Allah knoweth their secret talk
Then how will it be with them when the angels gather them smiting their faces and their backs
That will be because they followed that which angereth Allah and hated that which pleaseth Him
Therefor He hath made their actions vain
Or do those in whose hearts is a disease deem that Allah will not bring to light their secret hates
And if We would We could show them unto thee Muhammad so that thou shouldst know them surely by their marks
And thou shalt know them by the burden of their talk
And Allah knoweth your deeds
And verily We shall try you till We know those of you who strive hard for the cause of Allah and the steadfast and till We test your record
Lo those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them they hurt Allah not a jot and He will make their actions fruitless
O ye who believe
Obey Allah and obey the messenger and render not your actions vain
Lo those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and then die disbelievers Allah surely will not pardon them
So do not falter and cry out for peace when ye will be the uppermost and Allah is with you and He will not grudge the reward of your actions
The life of the world is but a sport and a pastime
And if ye believe and ward off evil He will give you your wages and will not ask of you your wordly wealth
If He should ask it of you and importune you ye would hoard it and He would bring to light your secret hates
Lo ye are those who are called to spend in the way of Allah yet among you there are some who hoard
And as for him who hoardeth he hoardeth only from his soul
And Allah is the Rich and ye are the poor
And if ye turn away He will exchange you for some other folk and they will not be the likes of you
Lo We have given thee O Muhammad a signal victory
That Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that which is to come and may perfect His favour unto thee and may guide thee on a right path
And that Allah may help thee with strong help
He it is Who sent down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith unto their faith
Allah s are the hosts of the heavens and the earth and Allah is ever Knower Wise
That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide and may remit from them their evil deeds That in the sight of Allah is the supreme triumph
And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women who think an evil thought concerning Allah For them is the evil turn of fortune and Allah is wroth against them and hath cursed them and hath made ready for them hell a hapless journey s end
Allah s are the hosts of the heavens and the earth and Allah is ever Mighty Wise
Lo We have sent thee O Muhammad as a witness and a bearer of good tidings and a warner
That ye mankind may believe in Allah and His messenger and may honour Him and may revere Him and may glorify Him at early dawn and at the close of day
Lo those who swear allegiance unto thee Muhammad swear allegiance only unto Allah
The Hand of Allah is above their hands
So whosoever breaketh his oath breaketh it only to his soul s hurt while whosoever keepeth his covenant with Allah on him will He bestow immense reward
Those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind will tell thee Our possessions and our households occupied us so ask forgiveness for us
They speak with their tongues that which is not in their hearts
Say Who can avail you aught against Allah if He intend you hurt or intend you profit
Nay but Allah is ever Aware of what ye do
Nay but ye deemed that the messenger and the believers would never return to their own folk and that was made fairseeming in your hearts and ye did think an evil thought and ye were worthless folk
And so for him who believeth not in Allah and His messenger Lo We have prepared a flame for disbelievers
And Allah s is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth
He forgiveth whom He will and punisheth whom He will
And Allah is ever Forgiving Merciful
Those who were left behind will say when ye set forth to capture booty Let us go with you
They fain would change the verdict of Allah
Say unto them O Muhammad Ye shall not go with us
Thus hath Allah said beforehand
Then they will say Ye are envious of us
Nay but they understand not save a little
Say unto those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind Ye will be called against a folk of mighty prowess to fight them until they surrender and if ye obey Allah will give you a fair reward but if ye turn away as ye did turn away before He will punish you with a painful doom
There is no blame for the blind nor is there blame for the lame nor is there blame for the sick that they go not forth to war
And whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow and whoso turneth back him will He punish with a painful doom
Allah was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance unto thee beneath the tree and He knew what was in their hearts and He sent down peace of reassurance on them and hath rewarded them with a near victory
And much booty that they will capture
Allah is ever Mighty Wise
Allah promiseth you much booty that ye will capture and hath given you this in advance and hath withheld men s hands from you that it may be a token for the believers and that He may guide you on a right path
And other gain which ye have not been able to achieve Allah will compass it Allah is Able to do all things
And if those who disbelieve join battle with you they will take to flight and afterward they will find no protecting friend nor helper
It is the law of Allah which hath taken course aforetime
Thou wilt not find for the law of Allah aught of power to change
And He it is Who hath withheld men s hands from you and hath withheld your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had made you victors over them
Allah is Seer of what ye do
These it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the Inviolable Place of Worship and debarred the offering from reaching its goal
And if it had not been for believing men and believing women whom ye know not lest ye should tread them under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He will If the believers and the disbelievers had been clearly separated We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment
When those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry the zealotry of the Age of Ignorance then Allah sent down His peace of reassurance upon His messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of selfrestraint for they were worthy of it and meet for it
And Allah is Aware of all things
Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth
Ye shall indeed enter the Inviolable Place of Worship if Allah will secure having your hair shaven and cut not fearing
But He knoweth that which ye know not and hath given you a near victory beforehand
He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that He may cause it to prevail over all religion
And Allah sufficeth as a Witness
Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves
Thou O Muhammad seest them bowing and falling prostrate in worship seeking bounty from Allah and His acceptance
The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration
Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk delighting the sowers that He may enrage the disbelievers with the sight of them
Allah hath promised unto such of them as believe and do good works forgiveness and immense reward
O ye who believe
Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His messenger and keep your duty to Allah
Lo
Allah is Hearer Knower
O ye who believe
Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet nor shout when speaking to him as ye shout one to another lest your works be rendered vain while ye perceive not
Lo they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven unto righteousness
Theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward
Lo those who call thee from behind the private apartments most of them have no sense
And if they had had patience till thou camest forth unto them it had been better for them
And Allah is Forgiving Merciful
O ye who believe
If an evilliver bring you tidings verify it lest ye smite some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did
And know that the messenger of Allah is among you
If he were to obey you in much of the government ye would surely be in trouble but Allah hath endeared the faith to you and hath beautified it in your hearts and hath made disbelief and lewdness and rebellion hateful unto you
Such are they who are the rightly guided
It is a bounty and a grace from Allah and Allah is Knower Wise
And if two parties of believers fall to fighting then make peace between them
And if one party of them doeth wrong to the other fight ye that which doeth wrong till it return unto the ordinance of Allah then if it return make peace between them justly and act equitably Lo
Allah loveth the equitable
The believers are naught else than brothers
Therefore make peace between your brethren and observe your duty to Allah that haply ye may obtain mercy
O ye who believe
Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they are not let women deride women who may be better than they are neither defame one another nor insult one another by nicknames
Bad is the name of lewdness after faith
And whoso turneth not in repentance such are evildoers
O ye who believe
Shun much suspicion for lo some suspicion is a crime
And spy not neither backbite one another
Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother
Ye abhor that so abhor the other
And keep your duty to Allah
Lo
Allah is Relenting Merciful
O mankind
Lo We have created you male and female and have made you nations and tribes that ye may know one another
Lo the noblest of you in the sight of Allah is the best in conduct
Lo Allah is Knower Aware
The wandering Arabs say We believe
Say unto them O Muhammad Ye believe not but rather say We submit for the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts
Yet if ye obey Allah and His messenger He will not withhold from you aught of the reward of your deeds Lo
Allah is Forgiving Merciful
The true believers are those only who believe in Allah and His messenger and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah
Such are the sincere
Say unto them O Muhammad Would ye teach Allah your religion when Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and Allah is Aware of all things
They make it a favour unto thee Muhammad that they have surrendered unto Him
Say Deem not your Surrender a favour unto me but Allah doth confer a favour on you inasmuch as He hath led you to the Faith if ye are earnest
Lo Allah knoweth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth
And Allah is Seer of what ye do
Qaf
By the Glorious Qur an
Nay but they marvel that a warner of their own hath come unto them and the disbelievers say This is a strange thing
When we are dead and have become dust shall we be brought back again
That would be a far return
We know that which the earth taketh of them and with Us is a recording Book
Nay but they have denied the truth when it came unto them therefor they are now in troubled case
Have they not then observed the sky above them how We have constructed it and beautified it and how there are no rifts therein
And the earth have We spread out and have flung firm hills therein and have caused of every lovely kind to grow thereon
A vision and a reminder for every penitent slave
And We send down from the sky blessed water whereby We give growth unto gardens and the grain of crops
And lofty datepalms with ranged clusters
Provision made for men and therewith We quicken a dead land
Even so will be the resurrection of the dead
The folk of Noah denied the truth before them and so did the dwellers at ArRass and the tribe of Thamud
And the tribe of A ad and Pharaoh and the brethren of Lot
And the dwellers in the wood and the folk of Tubb a every one denied their messengers therefor My threat took effect
Were We then worn out by the first creation
Yet they are in doubt about a new creation
We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein
When the two Receivers receive him seated on the right hand and on the left
He uttereth no word but there is with him an observer ready
And the agony of death cometh in truth
And it is said unto him This is that which thou wast wont to shun
And the trumpet is blown
This is the threatened Day
And every soul cometh along with it a driver and a witness
And unto the evildoer it is said Thou wast in heedlessness of this
Now We have removed from thee thy covering and piercing is thy sight this day
And unto the evildoer his comrade saith This is that which I have ready as testimony
And it is said Do ye twain hurl to hell each rebel ingrate
Hinderer of good transgressor doubter
Who setteth up another god along with Allah
Do ye twain hurl him to the dreadful doom
His comrade saith Our Lord
I did not cause him to rebel but he was himself far gone in error
He saith Contend not in My presence when I had already proffered unto you the warning
The sentence that cometh from Me cannot be changed and I am in no wise a tyrant unto the slaves
On the day when We say unto hell Art thou filled and it saith Can there be more to come
And the Garden is brought nigh for those who kept from evil no longer distant
And it is said This is that which ye were promised
It is for every penitent and heedful one
Who feareth the Beneficent in secret and cometh with a contrite heart
Enter it in peace
This is the day of immortality
There they have all that they desire and there is more with Us
And how many a generation We destroyed before them who were mightier than these in prowess so that they overran the lands
Had they any place of refuge when the judgment came
Lo therein verily is a reminder for him who hath a heart or giveth ear with full intelligence
And verily We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six Days and naught of weariness touched Us
Therefor O Muhammad bear with what they say and hymn the praise of thy Lord before the rising and before the setting of the sun
And in the nighttime hymn His praise and after the prescribed prostrations
And listen on the day when the crier crieth from a near place
The day when they will hear the Awful Cry in truth
That is the day of coming forth from the graves
Lo We it is Who quicken and give death and unto Us is the journeying
On the day when the earth splitteth asunder from them hastening forth they come
That is a gathering easy for Us to make
We are Best Aware of what they say and thou O Muhammad art in no wise a compeller over them
But warn by the Qur an him who feareth My threat
By those that winnow with a winnowing
And those that bear the burden of the rain
And those that glide with ease upon the sea
And those who distribute blessings by command
Lo that wherewith ye are threatened is indeed true
And lo the judgment will indeed befall
By the heaven full of paths
Lo ye forsooth are of various opinion concerning the truth
He is made to turn away from it who is himself averse
Accursed be the conjecturers
Who are careless in an abyss
They ask When is the Day of Judgment
It is the day when they will be tormented at the Fire
And it will be said unto them Taste your torment which ye inflicted
This is what ye sought to hasten
Lo those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and watersprings
Taking that which their Lord giveth them for lo aforetime they were doers of good
They used to sleep but little of the night
And ere the dawning of each day would seek forgiveness
And in their wealth the beggar and the outcast had due share
And in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure
And also in yourselves
Can ye then not see
And in the heaven is your providence and that which ye are promised
And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth it is the truth even as it is true that ye speak
Hath the story of Abraham s honoured guests reached thee O Muhammad
When they came in unto him and said Peace he answered Peace and thought Folk unknown to me
Then he went apart unto his housefolk so that they brought a fatted calf
And he set it before them saying Will ye not eat
Then he conceived a fear of them
They said Fear not and gave him tidings of the birth of a wise son
Then his wife came forward making moan and smote her face and cried A barren old woman
They said Even so saith thy Lord
Lo He is the Wise the Knower
Abraham said And afterward what is your errand O ye sent from Allah
They said Lo we are sent unto a guilty folk
