# NLP-Pivot-Translation-in-low-resource-environment

This Machine Translation project focuses on translating low resource languages that have limited amout of datasets to train the NLP models, here we handle the low resource setting environments by using pivoting techniques where we pivot the source language to a language where we have sufficent datasets to train much accurate models and then translate the pivoted language to target language.

In this project we translate Azerbaijani language to English using Turkish as a pivot language so as to improve the quality of translation.

The Preprocessed Datasets, Models and Outputs generated in this project can be found in the google repository linked below.
